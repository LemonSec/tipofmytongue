1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,859
dot but several

like of thank you

4
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:17,230
returned to mark about that for the
moment

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:24,230
we go back to hear or so i'm

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,839

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,889
so that's i'd take teaches a course san
francisco i teach uh... ethical hacking

8
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:31,210
and uh...

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,050
uh... computer forensics and uh... used
to teach school classes and things like

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,000
that or basic networking stuff

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,490
and securities so i'm on twitter twitter
is awesome

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,090
if you're not on twitter

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,030
just join twitter rhetoric

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,120
uh...

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,400
uh... so

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,890
um...

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,790
launched horrible

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,220
said the security community just a short
such he sort of famous for saying sure

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,970
about

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,460
the things that that make it a shot by
together some kind of foolish

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,309
but anyway

22
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,239
i don't know if that's true of all
fields of security

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,590
but in my field it is absolutely true
that it is a search

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,570
denial of service is ridiculous
departure cartoon characters out there

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,079
just making the world absurd might find
it very amusing shalom

26
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,559
unlike played so

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,130
first we'll talk a lot of the characters
in the current draw circus which is

28
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,880
ridiculous

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,229
and a lot of fun

30
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,630
should be testing higher

31
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,810
uh... i can't

32
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,710
and so it's good

33
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,520
and uh... then burst free concert also
want to talk about where four is the old

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,259
fashioned detox which is mostly what you
see in the world today we take thousands

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,860
of machines make apartment you take down
somebody

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,230
and uh... they have to stop all the
facts

37
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,420
but there's a new kind layer seven
dawson peacock at over the last couple

38
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,840
years um... where you only need to send
a few package like one packet per second

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,120
and you take down the server because you
carefully choose package to do a lot of

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,890
games to server

41
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,630
and there's another one though i'm very
excited about the link local toss tom

42
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,030
which is a writer advertisement act that
kills everyone does machines on it

43
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,990
i network

44
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,190
and that when i thought so dangerous
that when i came across that i've not

45
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,189
the discover exactly i thought it might
be a bit

46
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:12,369
itin right to life branch will that was
sort of obscure

47
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:16,489
might secretly contacted microsoft like
you're supposed to do exactly is maybe

48
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,549
you'd like to patches

49
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,489
friends i had microsoft immediately got
me to the right people at the very

50
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,519
quickly got back with all of you know
we've known about that for a long time

51
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,239
we're not going to do anything about

52
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,579
well ok fine and i'll tell the world
depression for homework in everything

53
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,509
else

54
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:32,599
so that's what i'm doing

55
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,959
so on

56
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,639
and that is the most powerful back one
attacker presentable network of change

57
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,959
which seems like a problem to be but
apparently not smart

58
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,260
and which song

59
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,349
the star circus of course you got this
guy soch

60
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:47,069
with what you think

61
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,798
publishing a lot of secrets that the
u_s_ government is not wanting to

62
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:50,799
publish

63
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,010
and that creates a story in the world as
various people

64
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,340
get all excited and decided to be on his
side against inside and for some reason

65
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,609
or some other than decided that cool way
to support their causes that he got a

66
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:03,069
bunch of websites

67
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,659
like these characters

68
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,959
these anonymous guyz

69
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:06,989
originally just

70
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,700
posted double obscene jokes on fortune
but now they decided to take our

71
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,099
websites to save the world

72
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,069
supporting free speech truth about
search

73
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,429
which makes sense to them although not
really to me

74
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,790
but anyway tom

75
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,638
they started operation pay-back attached
scientology any mostly did this with the

76
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,729
lower but i am cannon which is gonna be
the most ridiculous to in the world

77
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,719
you could just open a browser to the
site you hate and press f five two five

78
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,980
two five eight five eight of the people
did that that would take it down

79
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,329
floorplan cannon

80
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,569
just automates that depresses applied
for you

81
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,559
that's about all the docs

82
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:44,519
anyway uh... but then aron bar decided
he would he would find these guys

83
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,199
announced that he knew who they were

84
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,309
and so

85
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:52,929
they decided to take him down and this
represent a step up in anonymous is

86
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:56,729
uh... activities instead of just taking
down just repeated nilesh servers

87
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,059
thousands of people

88
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:01,659
using the lower but i can't make up a
group of three or four people who

89
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,459
who were actually relatively competence
instead of using a technique that is

90
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,010
ridiculously out of date they got two
things are only about ten years out of

91
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,719
date

92
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,950
the sequel injection

93
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,920
and social engineering which is very
powerful

94
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,999
they took corporate sequins action as i
understand it difficult for the mail

95
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:19,039
server in the nation emails pertaining
to be

96
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,998
the owner of the company saying ever got
my password

97
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:25,689
or forgot my username pic please turn
off the firewall open a port the biggest

98
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:26,399
dilema

99
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,560
because it was apparently coming from
your gmail account

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,209
and after that they owned everything so
they don't usually millwall ghosh

101
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,670
wildly to the world

102
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,220
which is fantastically responsible and
that is the whole point of anonymous has

103
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,740
to do fantastically irresponsible things
and then you left haha

104
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,250
and so on

105
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,959
clearly got the emails

106
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,369
and females

107
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,499
in their mind justified their actions
because this guy was evil beyond belief

108
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:51,329
he was writing group it's for the
government for the chamber of commerce

109
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,000
he was

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,470
gonna make fake social media profiles
intricately to settle these

111
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,840
fantastically unethical probably call
the illegal thing she was gonna do so

112
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,619
everybody fled to the hills

113
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,169
trying to pretend that they had nothing
to do with this when they were all

114
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,609
deeply difficult at the bank of america
and cheaper of commerce such

115
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,340
the dollar also unit know what he was
doing any of that

116
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,570
you know the emails shows that didn't
know that the very became plausible

117
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,360
deniability

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,249
not to take another step up

119
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:18,189
earlier this week

120
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:21,249
monday they decided to take down the
chamber of commerce

121
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,669
instead of just using laurel and shannon

122
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,549
the is some relatively intelligent
techniques here they use dumb

123
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,669
drupal exploit

124
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:30,938
and again have to do it

125
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:37,419
so anonymous does seem to be getting
smarter in their tax

126
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,340
i've been coming about this stuff for
about a year it's important to me uh...

127
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,190
and a lot of people misunderstand you
i'm on one side of the other these guys

128
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,279
are criminals

129
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,770
and they can get in cotton going to
prison in addition playoff that nothing

130
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,930
that really bothers me about that was
the trip children into doing this

131
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,229
they publish website is that you can
join a little more brian can you help us

132
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,568
save the world

133
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,469
and they tell you won't get caught
because when the website goes down the

134
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,699
lose all the server logs

135
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,330
and they totally to get caught

136
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,310
and the good the only reason we are on
prisoners 'cause the government can't be

137
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,889
bothered to prosecute them all in my
opinion but the water certainly there

138
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,430
the tools completely obvious suggestions
thousands of packets per second right

139
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,079
from your i_q_ trash

140
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:19,319
you can't claim it was a virus or any
other of the ruling stupid excuses

141
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,519
they're just

142
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,389
uh... school court parkour group of

143
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,029
grown-ups

144
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,259
recruiting teenagers and throwing
intervals

145
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:28,999
it's

146
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,919
cynical cruel and wrong

147
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,679
but it's also stupid

148
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,840
in your reply to

149
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,359
rachie because i think common among
people involved in law enforcement any

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,800
level which i sort of animal about a
copy of the universe purity

151
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,289
to see somebody do something she will
you want to have better ethics to do

152
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,128
that

153
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:49,389
and if you don't have better graphics
got a better skills but it was so

154
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:50,679
stupidly

155
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:53,479
and these guys feel both tests

156
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,900
especially before the show you doing
this stuff it was just a lower burdine

157
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,399
can exit all come on guys is as a joker
y

158
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,319
anne wait the gesture that's why a lot
of people think i support gesture

159
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,080
custody yesterday's just is illegal

160
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,580
and headed for big trouble

161
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,889
but he's smarter

162
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,360
his techniques are technically
interesting he's academy tactically i

163
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,030
wish he would lay off the black cat
stuff

164
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,878
and come help us study dial service
attacks because she has a good one

165
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,159
and he's and he's smart enough to
participant to which i'm not i'm trying

166
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:24,929
to portland to my i cant haven't
succeeded yet

167
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:28,140
so he's just got also going to save the
world to denial of service

168
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,479
but he's ex-military infuses we're seven
that i'll serviced by believe although

169
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,390
he has never explicitly said what he
does but he only needs one machine three

170
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,099
does not need recruit thousands of
teenagers to do is work for him

171
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,199
but then erased on websites and he's on
the right presents on the left so he's

172
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,419
pretty down is launching on its website
with the leaks and anybody that

173
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,000
he feels is opposing the military

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,549
uh... stand he talked about these things
on twitter

175
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:57,019
his tool automatically pushed east we
trim website go down

176
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:01,509
and i think a lot done wiki lakes for a
whole day from one machine

177
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,430
uh... and i was convinced that was him
he does go to chat rooms like those

178
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,510
destinies editor proving all turn it off

179
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,830
mckinney's came back up

180
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,479
alternate back on bikini cut back down
again

181
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,709
so i believe it was one person
patrolling of some people accuse him of

182
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,530
doing this for the bod and i cannot
prove that is not true

183
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,380
but i know there is no need for
apartment to do this

184
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,109
not for the last couple years later
seventy mile service tax have been here

185
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,619
and so i believe is there any way cures
that crashed

186
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:28,830
but he leads out free day and a half

187
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,440
from this one guy

188
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,010
and ask the gesture and he anonymous
have been each others' throats and doing

189
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,870
dirty tricks like each other out such

190
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,760
and he's

191
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,480
on twitter frequently as a blog in
elections until he cited sit-down

192
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,590
westborough baptist now these people are
incredibly offensive in every possible

193
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,620
way

194
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,830
and as far as anybody could tell that
still business model is too

195
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,630
funerals of picket major case someone
actually fully conscious innovation and

196
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,880
they should make money but anyway

197
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,120
so teenage son so we took him down four
eight weeks

198
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
he claims that the longest denial of
service attack in history that may very

199
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,529
well be true

200
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,540
but he did that from a single three g
cell phone

201
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540
kicking up for website

202
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,270
at which i also believe is probably true

203
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,319
because i know you could to a place even
i could do it even any of my students

204
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,389
could do

205
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,040
i do not know exactly how it all works

206
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,020
but i know the general principles to
make such a thing possible match what

207
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,050
seems to be pretty important on

208
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,718
here's the old-fashioned lear for detox
many attackers to one target

209
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:32,390
and pretty much all you do here is
consume all of them

210
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,689
this so that these guys

211
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,320
refused service to which he lied to
amazon basin a bunch of other people

212
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,160
uh... anonymous decided to take him down

213
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,449
thomas so they took their laurel and
cannon which just sorta like a bunch of

214
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,600
villagers story castle but for dropship
using pitchforks

215
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,279
and uh... this is the thing it runs

216
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,410
ipl short of

217
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,750
like a fun game

218
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,960
and dumped it sends a bunch of packets

219
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,000
and they brought down visa and master
card and a bunch of other sites they

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,410
could not bring down hamas on the truck

221
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,120
but as you have his own is really big

222
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,420
and really proud of their fault
tolerance redundant services in

223
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,650
everything you want to serve on amazon
down as they make a mistake inside your

224
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,730
own company

225
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,440
when i went down a few one month ago
people ask me was that an attack from

226
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,380
anonymous national i don't think that
anybody on the planet jupiter you know i

227
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,139
was down accept an insider making stupid
mistake

228
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,600
lately on

229
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,779
so they're also went down for about a
day one day and thirteen hours

230
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,389
and that was from three thousand
attackers working together uh... initial

231
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:31,350
area security logs of the r_c_ channel

232
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,670
they do this from a normal irish teacher

233
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,729
all those more brian can't connect to
the ir she shivered it's not running the

234
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,410
right kind of software it's not on the
right kind of server so we're always

235
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,630
losing their connections to the ocean
channels nothing there

236
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,890
lest they drop off again approved this
garbage price offer creche again what's

237
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,040
wrong with you what's wrong with you
what's happening over what's happening

238
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,750
rechecking anyway

239
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,180
is what's actually going on

240
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,680
in the storm of confuse people

241
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,300
taking a mastercard but somehow it
succeeded

242
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,040
and one widely reputed

243
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,209
uh... rumor about that is the one person
actually joint who had a real pot

244
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,660
stolen the usual way of thirty thousand
jeans and that's why it worked

245
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,640
and that has led to exclude inside
anonymous where one of the uh... leaders

246
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,770
knowledge claims to have no leaders but
now through three leaders have emerged

247
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,510
in the ground

248
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,439
trying to take it further down and
becomes a real leader

249
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,450
and one of them once you get rid of them
are both teenagers can just have three

250
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,190
or four people with block grants

251
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,329
taking things down 'cause that's that's
the with criminals do it in

252
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,519
test where they think they should do it
you well leslie other criminals do it

253
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,530
once they're doing it for money these
guys are also criminals

254
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,199
but they're doing it for loans perhaps
to save the world but mostly just the

255
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,210
last everybody

256
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,010
uh... and that's the kind of attack the
kaspersky knows about the estimates

257
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,670
recently

258
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,699
how many young

259
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,090
computers would it take to bring down

260
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,440
uh... south africa and he said two
hundred dust

261
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,950
and i immediately rebelled i say that
it's rediculous it would take one cell

262
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,019
i happen to know that

263
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,600
and i will show you

264
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,870
if he did it the way not arrested at the
property three thousand changes going

265
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,730
right there and that's obviously what
he's thinking up here

266
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,279
salir seven dos three takedown machines

267
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,520
when you really want to come down here
not messing around

268
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,900
this has been around for several years
you'll find it in hacking exposed fifth

269
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,728
edition

270
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:17,879
uh... a company called hectic should
israel was doing a penetration testing

271
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,760
they wanted to see how well they can
bring on a website

272
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,660
if you want to bring down the website

273
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,819
uh... tickets and pain juicy and show
you the people it's these take a lot of

274
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,530
those what you do if you look at the
website find out something that's

275
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,610
expensive for them to serve up like
their search engine

276
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,810
where you put in a short period one
packet and they'd have to send that ten

277
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,520
thousand gets and he said a bunch of
though still usable to cebu in the

278
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,329
server

279
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,920
the problem is you have to customers
that attack for free website so it's a

280
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,870
lot of work in research to bring down
one website

281
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,950
but when you do it doesn't take very
much

282
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,720
push ticket website educated workers

283
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,320
but now we have quite a few

284
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,880
generic clear seven toss it actually do
not have to customize it to the website

285
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,509
and therefore you can just making it
actual uses

286
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:03,850
so i'm

287
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,730
as they came here so tears bc t b debt

288
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,490
should hopefully a sitting pretty
familiar this is just wire short

289
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,010
capturing it so we got and i keep packet
major reality cpa packet with an

290
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,859
h_t_t_p_ layer seven payload

291
00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:18,400
and that's just get

292
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,430
it's got a few more lines you're liking
your agent hosty connection and so

293
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,680
what you do is use and only part of the
cat

294
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,859
and you send never finishes and so the
line weights thinking well this packet

295
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,000
dot fragmented

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,530
that was the first half of the gap in
the second half is common

297
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,020
and apache has two hundred fifty five
input channels in each one of the more

298
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,960
weight for four hundred chechans should
be just send warning complete get

299
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,240
per second the entire

300
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
input buffer is full and nobody can get
service out of the server

301
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,939
the cebu is not a hundred percent

302
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,430
the traffic is minimal

303
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,790
you can run a few anonymous asian
routine like toward because it doesn't

304
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,530
have much bandwidth

305
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,689
the server stops

306
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,400
sucessful our sitter which robert hansen
wrote much of the blast f come along

307
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,420
with him

308
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,349
and it works just fine

309
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,899
it only works against apache it's really
a design flaw in apache

310
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,459
it does not work against high yes
because i a s does not handle incomplete

311
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,680
requests in this fashion

312
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,020
aspire worried this one will stop by ups
argued that yet

313
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,680
are you dead yet sends incomplete posts

314
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,670
which is you find a former you're
supposed to sense that they don't like

315
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,709
the username and password you just send
one letter

316
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,839
and in a long time before he sent
another letter

317
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,280
maybe you never send the rest your part
way through posting something

318
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
and takes a lot more than

319
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,729
take several thousand of those per
second but it will bring down it will

320
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,720
bring the highest server

321
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,220
stopping shirking underneath bring down
the server they don't call it the server

322
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,570
to crash is suing to stop the attack the
server began serving real customers

323
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,380
again

324
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,180
they just

325
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,689
make the server unavailable

326
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,230
and there's a couple who wants to keep a
white dos

327
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,230
which relies upon the fact that they
uh...

328
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,590
aki polite packet i didn't know about
this one read about this somebody told

329
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,689
me about it when ur

330
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:03,670
aki polite packet

331
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,990
can send one hundred to question the
single package

332
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,259
i don't really know why

333
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,830
coming up and many more bodies to keep
you in the explained why but

334
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,180
anyway if he said they head method now
the head method doesn't ask for the page

335
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,069
at once only the header which in
normally never even see

336
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:22,360
but they had her just as if you want to
be information about server

337
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,790
but apparently if u repressed a head
from observer server has to do as much

338
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:33,790
work to stand up a whole page

339
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,870
yeah

340
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,790
please

341
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,140
all-day so

342
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,650
but uh...

343
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,480
but apparently the servers even if you
get ahead request even if a proxy wooden

344
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,379
past the precursor versa lester

345
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:57,379
and a whole page

346
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,639
okay bodyguard anyway so but this thing
also works they call keep dead

347
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,070
uh... headlight

348
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,469
compiling the brain just fine keep dead

349
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:11,799
runs down here it's sending these things
are going to kill it each candle gives

350
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,480
up a lot more c_p_ leave that used to be
percent my test

351
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,300
and if you have something better to just
a blank page which is what i used to use

352
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,880
a a page with like search query on it
than you can easily crusher for two

353
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,420
hundred percent

354
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,050
so it's another form of layer seven
blocks

355
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,790
and again relatively junior

356
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,180
gesture uses this thing he calls searcy
and nobody knows where it came from ur

357
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,069
exactly what it does but he has posted
videos have been in action

358
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,750
and a video kinda shows you what it does
it's got his local host here making the

359
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,750
attack

360
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,120
the attacks and goes to the torah
normalization network or something

361
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,389
similar comes out a exit node

362
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:54,420
so that the defender can no longer
identify these packets that could never

363
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,420
tracked him down to imprison him

364
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,319
and they can

365
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,389
make a firewall rule that will block
these packets because they're coming in

366
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:04,819
from random real life he addresses just
like real customers

367
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,099
and uh...

368
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,409
then he goes to the target missing is
the target is detected with the

369
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,070
heartbeat to no longer insured paying
the next week's one list which you saw

370
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,980
tango down

371
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,880
so we just put all its writable looks
like flesh looking kind interface here

372
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,670
and that's the truth uses

373
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,350
and then after use listing for about a
year he poured into a cell phone and

374
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,369
used to take out west for a baptist
retrieves the cell phone

375
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:31,760
is technically very interesting to me
and i said i'm attempting to follow in

376
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,590
his footsteps and transfer might actual
cell phones without much luck so far but

377
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,750
hopefully i will work

378
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,070
anyway on

379
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,700
they dental the last attack here comes
down the street is why i got a roomful

380
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,400
machines but i'm sure that were class
twenties uh... week local talk show and

381
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,930
this one

382
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,279
i came across it because i'm very
efficient nike version six

383
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,150
ravenous would strike the version six
because our party person forest full

384
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,080
the new

385
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,620
protocol i_p_ version six is full of all
kinds of mistakes that people really

386
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,908
knew better than ninety percent for into
making the same mistakes again but

387
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:07,120
there's a few no mistakes to be made

388
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,110
yeah i think version forget typically
had addresses which dac p

389
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,050
so i put the client it says i need my
pizza server shows use their psyche past

390
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,590
the end of the exchanges in other

391
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,439
packet goes back and forth but that's
the end and it's not going to ask for

392
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,850
another i_q_ address

393
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,750
for a long time like case

394
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,660
so it's the end of that discussion

395
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,350
buddy heidi version six except push
process instead of a pool process the

396
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,168
router comes up in the router sends out
periodically router advertisements that

397
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:35,980
says

398
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,500
everybody better join my network because
i'm a router

399
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,450
you better send me your package

400
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,360
and every one of those machines makes up
their own i_p_ aggression drawings that

401
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,309
network

402
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,730
that's how it works it's a push process

403
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,180
and therefore

404
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,809
on these router advertisement packets

405
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:53,200
are what controls earth

406
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,409
and id go to

407
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:56,140
at thing

408
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,420
left f_f_a_ zero to coleman coleman one
is the hoten twenty eight-day like the

409
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,960
version six address now

410
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,260
if you had study i_p_ version six one of
the first things i will say is already

411
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,850
burdened six does not have broadcast

412
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,610
well it has this acouple to colin wong
is a multi casting trash which goes to

413
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,219
all of those now if there is a
difference

414
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,520
between multicast to all nodes and
broadcast

415
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,850
some religious difference as far as i
could tell i'm

416
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,090
is that perhaps some metaphysical sense
in which they are different

417
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,480
but for all practical purposes that's
broadcast it goes to every dog

418
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,720
one packet a broader advertisement has
some header information so that it has a

419
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,500
prefix so its ends at the first sixty
four-bit should be addressed it says

420
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,470
here's that we're here is the network
you're joining

421
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,500
make up any kind don't you want for the
last sixty four-bit and join my network

422
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,960
that's how i i p version six works on
america dressing as is usually done

423
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
i keep g_-eight sheep he does exist for
i think version six but it's almost

424
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,050
never used

425
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,040
so

426
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,670
what you can do is send out a bunch of
my team

427
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,750
version six router advertisements

428
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,850
and then europe or client machines will
join all those networks because another

429
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,870
fun thing about i_q_ version six is
everybody uses multi homing

430
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,489
and i think the reason for client teams
typically have only one address

431
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,440
but i'd be version six every machine
every interfaces expected to have two or

432
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,150
three or more dresses

433
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,030
one blink local starting at the eighty
public one it may be more public ones

434
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,200
which is actually kind of a problem to
because it makes it kind of difficult

435
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,900
thing to figure out which address to
usually send packets out

436
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
but anyway tom

437
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,440
would this is just hoping the rock
seasonable many i_p_ version six the

438
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,710
problem is that windows is extremely
inefficient doing this

439
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,890
when you join the network by p person
six windows users a lot of cebu and i do

440
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,690
not know why

441
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,590
i've been

442
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,159
bicycle microsoft than they were told
before me money you're going to have not

443
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,290
issued a bold new world order
explanation of this at all

444
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,710
but for some reason it takes them a lot
of work and i can address to your face

445
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,680
i can only guess that after they had the
hike interest to the interface they must

446
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,370
adjust the firewall profile in
determining

447
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,258
if they're

448
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,570
have a group policy setting and uh...

449
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,179
whatever else they have to do this a
bunch of job that has to happen from

450
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,560
joining a network in windows operating
systems but the result is a christian

451
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,360
find packets per second

452
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,639
use up all the sepia tone

453
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,600
and these are broadcast packets of one
attacker preached on every which you

454
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,620
know the network

455
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,729
that's powerful

456
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,770
and all windows machines the
speaker-to-be version six are vulnerable

457
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,410
by default

458
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,280
as far as i can tell anybody else
content

459
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,300
so listen mark howser discovered this in
for microsoft in july

460
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,470
i didn't elements almost a year later

461
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,590
made for the electoral which we don't
care

462
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,720
microsoft opinion is you should let
anybody go on your local network now you

463
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,130
can send this over the internet

464
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,399
well i'm working on it

465
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:51,770
but it it's got to be local um...

466
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,000
i think there may very well be able to
make this a remote attack on work not

467
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,039
because they're a bunch of i_p_ version
six titles to configure automatically

468
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,620
and if you send something through a
tunnel which he killed is not decadent

469
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,389
so

470
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,440
i'm working on that country escapee i
should be able to economic configured

471
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,039
tomlinson dipak remotely

472
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,090
but anyway

473
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,389
even if you don't do that

474
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,670
how much do you really trust your local
area network

475
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,220
now that everybody has cell phones like
heads and laptops and everything that

476
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,090
you really believe that your own local
network is safe

477
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,570
for sample right here back to the strike
to agree with this machine in this room

478
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,820
and i'm going to do it dot com monthly

479
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,210
i'm kind of it's in the title might talk
if they approve it is the audience i've

480
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,860
audience participation as victims

481
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,280
uh... so

482
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,230
because like i did

483
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,330
unseen actual this i had the same
podcast

484
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,629
and people heard about it

485
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:40,100
and uh... so

486
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,320
some students in massachusetts try it at
home

487
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,178
and they killed an xbox in play station
exit

488
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,230
and so that's interesting and i hadn't
thought of that it's not just windows

489
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,679
machines that are vulnerable

490
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,409
random other networking devices are bold
anybody that has a slightly written nine

491
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:57,820
p persian six tackle people

492
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,169
they may be a lot of other devices that
are vulnerable

493
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,509
uh... ansel

494
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,869
opportunity investigated cisco juniper
devices for foldable

495
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:07,350
cisco pastor stopping juniper did not

496
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,709
juniper says they're going to wait for
i_t_t_ f to do something

497
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,820
anyway on there are ways to defend
yourself against this thing

498
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,750
but rather than going to that too much
for me to show what you want to let you

499
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,489
know my demo works here now i've got
this old running

500
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:25,399
in virtual machines

501
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:28,799
i don't trust virtual machines they
opposed me enough

502
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,559
i've given many talk shows

503
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,960
that failed because virtual machines
refused to connect properly so i brought

504
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,940
along with your real machinist

505
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,040
which accounts for intrigued

506
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,070
quite so much start with the router
advertisement such prohibit the simplest

507
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,139
one first but see what i have procured
rests on this machine here at this is

508
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,770
uh...

509
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,480
out on that

510
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,769
you don't need to worry about this
creamy here right away i'm just that one

511
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:52,679
there

512
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,930
this here is a window seven virtual
machine

513
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,450
and theoretically

514
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,190
you destroyed it's going to myself on by
the way not to the network that you are

515
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,250
all using for what i will become obvious
reasons

516
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,500
uh... this is a cheap way to make an
isolated network so this machines one

517
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,630
eighty one sixty eight eleven something
or other

518
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,010
and it has only

519
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,040
to i_p_ version six address

520
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,559
it has one at the eighty address which
every interface makes up as soon as it

521
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,520
comes up and i keep urgent six has one i
put on my cell phone bill true colin

522
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,620
colin too

523
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,489
when i was doing other projects

524
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,240
sung in a sense of broader
advertisements uranus and just a few

525
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,970
uh... broder tool called slow flood

526
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,800
and has been sent one packet per second

527
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,020
concerned about three of them

528
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,600
and them if you look here

529
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,459
you'll see

530
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,490
it has made

531
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,150
three or four temporary addresses in
three or four per minute dresses which

532
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,740
is perfectly fine

533
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,110
and so that's the result is surely
router ever touch institution

534
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,439
now if you take a look at some other
machine such as for example for

535
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,620
macintosh welsh terrier and uh...

536
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,679
it's also

537
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,790
joining this network and if you take a
look at this coupon to one x machine

538
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,750
this one here lacking

539
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,320
all my you know i can right now

540
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,909
except in

541
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,380
began it's now and three

542
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,640
heightened

543
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,070
does not belong lol

544
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,320
on one

545
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,389
but i'm not going to do it all winter
comes from the past flooded commander

546
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,030
ordered most machines stressed we pretty
much at the end of my car

547
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,330
in fact if you leave this lingo for more
than about thirty seconds

548
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,580
it will kill vmware

549
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,039
and it will kill the mac os ten
underneath vmware

550
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,400
which is pretty pretty irritating

551
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,490
so uh...

552
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,820
breath i want to do that chilled little
bit later

553
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,300
but let me do one of the overtaxed force
attack is good clean fun here

554
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,669
funded this machine icassp config
because this is what action

555
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,929
on one issue one sixty eight eleven two
thirty four

556
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:06,769
and i'm running a server on that and com

557
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:07,390
address

558
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,140
shall i guess i can show you that

559
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,080
here let's just bring up chrome and my
window seven to go to that address one

560
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,480
ninety two one sixty eight

561
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,050
eleven

562
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,940
to thirty-four

563
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,090
and theoretically

564
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:31,830
and received the n_-word wasn't mothers
we are ok this is just a default

565
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,320
uh... apache server sos nothing very
interesting about that they did

566
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,889
but it is running a server dns servers
out

567
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,440
now this news people austral

568
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,100
uh... when i talked about this a dot com
last year we had a living space version

569
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,469
written by robert hansen are snake

570
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,660
and since then all wasp it got me
actually written this tools to tell slow

571
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,029
henderson slow posts which is very nice
nice it actual

572
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,700
to learn about layer seven dawson and
practiced in the defense is working

573
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,040
on something i learned alot if users
group which extremely useful is about

574
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,909
this thing called server status this
will show you what's going on in your

575
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,550
country server

576
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,159
which is pretty nice

577
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,280
short short me right now i'd only got
one connection which is this connection

578
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,639
me viewing the search

579
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,230
their total one hundred fifty
connections you can make

580
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,600
so when i start this attack

581
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,459
it's going to send a bunch of incomplete
requests up here and there they are

582
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,700
filling this thing up with our those
requests being processed

583
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,640
and when they all fill up to a hundred
and fifty which is right now nobody's

584
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,040
going to be able to see any pages in the
server anymore

585
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,580
this is just like all the phone bank and
putting on land on hold

586
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,990
nobody can get in

587
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,309
it's not using up and which is not using
up sheepy u

588
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,670
but just that one or two packets per
second is all you need and

589
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,990
the server is dead

590
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,430
one cool thing is when you stop the
attack

591
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,600
if recovers quickly

592
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,740
and normally only one or two of them
recover their cover slowly i think i

593
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,120
just had uh... the timing on the server
to make a lil bit faster

594
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,928
in one of the many projects i've done

595
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:03,000
virtual changed

596
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,040
but that's the source of tak

597
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,480
in all of its glory

598
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,600
so

599
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,780
i think the thing i want to do now

600
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,590
we see what kind of the family have
breakthrough but

601
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:20,590
uh... you any questions about anything
out there

602
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,740
yaa

603
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
birthday upset

604
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,680
with its

605
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,940
dot he's set

606
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,360
along

607
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,649
but you have to do well

608
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:41,660
uh... you can't be on local and find yes
yes

609
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,280
tfc that's one thing and that i have not
done yet but i think it may contain

610
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,428
webpage that all of you usually one
person your company to click on that

611
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:52,370
link review that website killing him
there

612
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,320
and you'll see their debt final that's
white it scares me and i don't think my

613
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,320
clock is correct to ignore it is not
active yet but no uh... org

614
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,300
uh... website

615
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,470
well

616
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:17,470
and or what you are pushing richard
worked hard working ability to redirect

617
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,030
wrapping but it doesn't cause a wishing
to crash

618
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,240
we are questioning stops indian tribes
in africa

619
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,669
for twenty years old

620
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:31,190
okay delaware and georgia version of
that certainly true in germany was

621
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,740
divided projects but the thing about
this case every windows machine your

622
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,370
network

623
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,389
docs and has to be restarted cold

624
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,080
swat that troubles me

625
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,360
well you're certainly correct

626
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,639
and or a whole bunch of if you have
access to the local everything redirect

627
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,210
traffic a lot of wedge

628
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,670
and i don't want to stop that

629
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,150
but this is more than just wrap
retraction

630
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,370
it really means you have to restart all
your servers such major siebel server

631
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,879
and everything else

632
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,399
it seems like it's work should but

633
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:58,549
it's differently

634
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,879
any other questions

635
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:01,050
did the questions

636
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,860
well let me hum like i say

637
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,110
the last one hundred full speed until
she refused admission actually things to

638
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,879
see their

639
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:10,408
the miami shores china slides before
more damaging to this point

640
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,560
um...

641
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,399
art so anyway to protect yourself
against this

642
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,880
there are a lot of ways

643
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,870
you can just turn off like a version six
if you're not using it which polls

644
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,899
nobody else

645
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,100
if you use windows xp haven't in turned
on i_q_ heard six it's not there and of

646
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,590
course then this will defect at all

647
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,610
of course that's not very good because a
lot of people do when he is like the

648
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,178
first six

649
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,350
as you're moving forward and also you
for using windows seven their windows

650
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,699
vista the nike persian six did you find
features commander seventy kids who

651
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,870
direct access at home groups

652
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,969
and you probably would like to use those

653
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,400
com so i don't recommend that of course
about as one solution

654
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,309
if you don't have my papers in six
running in this attack on virtually

655
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:52,979
you can turn off broader discovery

656
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:55,480
the simple command-line that would mean
used

657
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,539
no longer

658
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:59,779
listen to router advertisements and auto
configure and that's what i think people

659
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:03,139
to do on their servers you probably
don't want your show workers

660
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:06,209
reconfiguring to automatically join
efforts for the same reason you normally

661
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,950
don't let servers use jcp you put static
addresses on them

662
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,240
and you probably want but static i_p_
project addresses onto your mothers will

663
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,040
turn off broader discovery

664
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,540
but your client's probably do when he
was on a discovery that's the point

665
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,540
claim to a portable cheese people
carried in

666
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,170
for those i think it will block rogue
roderick hodge and for the firewall the

667
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,690
windows firewall can do it you just have
to turn it off

668
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,980
this is not a very strong defense
however

669
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,560
because uh...

670
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,570
it's using the source

671
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,700
i'd be version six address to tell the
authorized broader advertisers

672
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,419
from the unauthorized ones

673
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:44,690
and an intelligent targeted intelligent
attacker could sniff the network and

674
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,299
find out that addressed and spook
package managers

675
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,740
so it'd be easy to

676
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,260
circumvent fast

677
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,000
but it's probably good enough to protect
client machines which are at the end of

678
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,080
the world figured out anyway

679
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,870
and of course

680
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,989
on cisco has their proprietary solution
are a garden

681
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,380
presumably juniper will get on board one
of these days dot it people will have

682
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,539
uh... are a guard on the switches

683
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:10,510
so you can choose one physical ports to
be the only porters lodge and are a

684
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,120
student at work

685
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,860
the problem there is

686
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,820
uh... wireless but you probably
disappointed subsidies of wireless

687
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,909
networks anyway

688
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:22,280
so there is a feature caller regard on
the newest generation switches

689
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,428
if you have the best equipment but small
businesses and people with all the

690
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:27,780
cooking or not to have that

691
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,970
and there is actually way around that

692
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,470
theoretically the very latest version of
the attack to run using here which is t

693
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,270
h e dot g version six

694
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,420
confirmed and housing

695
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,780
has paid

696
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,040
fragmentation header just to get around
for a guard

697
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,350
sorry gardens but the big enterprises
are planning to say that sells

698
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,289
but the one thing about ninety percent
six instead of having a partial field in

699
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:51,029
the header

700
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:52,619
which is not always used

701
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,889
they have attesting series of headers so
your first i'd be very insecure rising

702
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:58,379
next headers

703
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,279
tells it was going to be the next letter

704
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,799
and you can have as many of these
changes you want

705
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,789
it is part of the specification so
packets actually have a different number

706
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:06,960
of headers

707
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,940
if you have a more complicated package
terms on more headers until it has put

708
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,659
all the information age in there

709
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,889
so if you turn on a fragmentation header

710
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:18,169
you may remember that earlier packet let
me go back to that earlier

711
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,429
march are captured their

712
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:20,759
here's what a normal

713
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,169
are a pack it looks like

714
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,230
you've got some

715
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,659
uh...

716
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:29,020
they had a riskier type one thirty four
router advertisement then you've got

717
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,120
checks on all that stuff

718
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,070
and then you got my cnp version ships
which were broader advertisements are

719
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,450
including a prefix

720
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,739
but if you want to get past are a
guarded

721
00:33:38,739 --> 00:33:42,370
you just had a bunch of unnecessary
fragmentation headers here

722
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,908
filling a fragmentation header

723
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:46,300
next enter fragmentation header next
header

724
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,250
and down here is the russian people to
checks so the packet looks different

725
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,179
now i do not have access to a switch
with regard to test this but then how

726
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:58,880
can release this apparently in the
belief that this will circumvent aria

727
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,600
garda it if it does ari burns pretty
lame

728
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,149
because that's just a baby are actually
and this could happen to attack it it

729
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:10,439
was too large on the way and it should
be fragmented and uh... at the source

730
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:15,259
anyway so uh... but that is not a
possibility and that is one of the many

731
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:18,019
headaches of i_q_ dirty tricks

732
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:21,308
anyway to defend herself against these
attacks

733
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:25,200
the defenses are actually very late mean
right now the only reason your website

734
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,629
is up is because nobody hates you

735
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:31,118
or all the people who you are stupid

736
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,879
that's what

737
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,089
activists

738
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,830
this is why i thought the gesture was so
important

739
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,418
if we want to go i think a she was
enough to take on your site

740
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:43,888
this is unacceptable nobody can run
business to government anything no

741
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,429
matter what usually or something but i
think this talk later

742
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:51,559
that they have anything when you hit the
stalking they could should be dead that

743
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,109
would be unacceptable way to run a
conference

744
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,129
and that story goes on the internet

745
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:57,639
so i'm

746
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,750
this is bad

747
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:03,490
no one person should be able to do
anything can bring on your website

748
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,828
but that's the way we are right now so
he's going to defend yourself is not

749
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:09,900
security which uh... who's been talked
about earlier today

750
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,890
on mon security does have some
protection against later seven dos uh...

751
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,990
the ones i've seen are not that good you
can stop that particular to like you can

752
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,319
stop a lot of connections from seamonkey
address

753
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,989
and that will limit the damage

754
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:28,109
of the school doors attack wind on with
that windows-based testing tool but it

755
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:31,509
would not stop the gesture because he
runs it through toward that coming from

756
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:34,209
all different addresses

757
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,868
the uh...

758
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,729
you can also um...

759
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:40,549
filter traffic you can find something
similar in its own

760
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,609
but it's it's really not all that
effective

761
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:44,259
a better solutions

762
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:46,219
are uh... the load balancer

763
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:49,729
loan balances will actually saving a lot
of ways no one doubts respectfully

764
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:53,519
hardware and sits in front of your web
server takes the requests and then

765
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,379
parcels the mount to europe

766
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:56,790
sharper cluster

767
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,820
this one takes that one so it doesn't
even pass any request onto the server at

768
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,010
all that is a complete if you said half
of something it waits for the other half

769
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,209
a dozen part of the server all

770
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:11,299
truck tried that facility clinics
machines an attack that we will load

771
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:14,670
balancer and that didn't make it more
resistance however a sufficient number

772
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,249
these packets when in fact overwhelm all
the bells so you just move the problem

773
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:22,709
from one device to another but it was
stronger in my tests and presumably a

774
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:25,210
stronger load balancer the protector
shiver

775
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,069
but in the server software it's always
the same principles getting a web

776
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:31,890
application firewall to protect your web
application by stopping posted a bad

777
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,788
stuff

778
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:34,089
apakah mine

779
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:37,139
protect people against denial of service
all the time and i got a chance to talk

780
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:40,929
to the aca my guy responsible for those
that layer seven from a conference in

781
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:43,439
san francisco which scenario

782
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,348
and he told me some very few stuff

783
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:48,819
now an aca might get some answers to
actually work from local cash into your

784
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:49,520
page

785
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,550
so you don't need to get your server
name any effectively many servers

786
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,349
cancer quickly so it's harder to bring
them down

787
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,799
on you can also used to be an s
redirection

788
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,999
to move the attachment of inflation if
the attacker has been

789
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,879
friendly enough to attack you by i_p_
address

790
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,830
you could be in brought your domain name
to go to different server of course

791
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,119
that's no trick

792
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:12,929
and in the attack will keep attacking
the old one but your real customers with

793
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,389
a new one

794
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:16,649
on and others

795
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,828
but the funny told me i'd never thought
it was this uh...

796
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:24,059
when you go to a website if you go there
from clicking on the link it passes in

797
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:26,220
the referrer entered the strangeness

798
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,799
misspelled

799
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:31,949
field in the h_t_t_p_ requested tells it
where you came from to meet easier for

800
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,639
people to different but search engines
are

801
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,940
giving the most value for advertisers

802
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,560
so what you do if you put a little page
in front

803
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,890
that is invisible to the issue that
contains nothing but javascript

804
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,118
and all the javascript does is reload
this page again

805
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,329
and then when the page if i go to

806
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:50,899
santosh dot info

807
00:37:50,899 --> 00:37:52,459
and i came from google

808
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:53,848
i'll see the javascript

809
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:57,609
when i come in the second time i will be
going to shift costs on the phone from

810
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,679
sam's club studied for the referral
people talked which is something you

811
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,129
could never happen under normal
circumstances

812
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:06,100
and you only show the real page

813
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,699
two people were hurt for eagles the
target this is brilliant

814
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:14,029
because you've just used very small
resources to handle each request you

815
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:17,669
just cannot one little short page just a
little javascript

816
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:20,230
the attackers will never get to the real
page

817
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,330
because the only people who get to the
page are people who actually take the

818
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,679
response grand jury in a browser in
execute the scripts

819
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,899
real customers trying to show your
website

820
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:34,479
clowns running attack tools solutioning
partially question not really caring

821
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,578
about the answer

822
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:36,760
are not going to do that

823
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,970
so they will never get anything which
little javascript page which is cheaper

824
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,488
you put up tandem anyway that's that
struck me as a very good solution

825
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,079
and that kind of thing

826
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,839
would really stop this whole category
but action a unit broadway

827
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:52,189
that's the kind of

828
00:38:52,189 --> 00:38:55,089
good thinking you know broad a whole new
way to go at it

829
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:58,058
will stop the whole category tax rather
than just trying to write

830
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:01,410
uh... specific rules to pick out each
one of the attack

831
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,098
favors i thought that was pretty good

832
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:05,559
uh... although i'm not aware of an
open-source product that will do that

833
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,519
for you off-the-shelf but it doesn't
seem like a bit too hard to going on

834
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,198
i have no idea

835
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:12,890
holder

836
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,019
are all all

837
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:20,678
rowboat for uh... start

838
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:26,479
live upset haha rob morrow pbl

839
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:27,790
all

840
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,320
let me bring it up here because that's
part of this is an engine exploded and

841
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:36,519
it does that

842
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,899
probing all over again

843
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:43,739
looked at

844
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:44,999
uh...

845
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,919
yet

846
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:47,598
are

847
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,729
europe

848
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:50,759
okay

849
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,910
all all

850
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,109
and act

851
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,279
ever

852
00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:01,390
sporting goods is aware seven defense we
see right now be here my sins my which

853
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,669
my students

854
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:07,149
and for me

855
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:12,949
but or

856
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:17,489
parties also the chances were good good
nobody that i appreciate the church

857
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:19,609
anyway dont

858
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:23,139
police or anything else irena milic alma
machines uh... just like

859
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:27,799
uh... concert where you burnish
instruments yet

860
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:30,579
well there's also a counter-attack tasty
boarded this this is kind of fun people

861
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:33,989
attacking issue just redefine your
d_n_a_ esta point back to their control

862
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:36,139
service in a blow themselves away

863
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:38,839
of course your website is down while
this happens

864
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:42,619
and seems to me like you could argue
that it's illegal here you are creating

865
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:44,509
a dos against somebody you know

866
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:47,289
but they're probably not going to go to
the cops and i don't think with anyway

867
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:50,930
it's kind of funny occupied a shield
about the polls that guy shooting out of

868
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,149
that beat legal or not anyway

869
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:56,589
uh... but brings them down that's for
sure

870
00:40:56,589 --> 00:41:00,659
art and i put a bunch of references here
dot this post talk is on my website

871
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:05,309
already changed class dot info me just
point out if anybody once a new stuff

872
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,109
but much of which were all there

873
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:08,979
and if you want a my stuff

874
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:10,129
mitchell

875
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:13,159
available for anybody at sam's club
study info

876
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,799
and there's the ah...

877
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:18,288
the power point this talk is right there

878
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:22,069
by kilby's missions uh... have twenty
minutes left so i should be able to kill

879
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,869
them

880
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:26,089
right now i'm hoping to preserve the
attacker but

881
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:27,969
i didn't want to do it until it

882
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:32,359
right so let's get this sucker back quit
this from through here

883
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:33,929
trophy

884
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:37,219
with a market research okay i got a few
of these right now

885
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:42,719
but for this brought the attack on a
little longer and i need to have

886
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:48,499
task manager reaches the sepia persians
estefan thing to watch on this one

887
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:55,238
and the attack is here okay doc slash
flood return

888
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,019
fiction use your own

889
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:05,019
now imprint

890
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:17,779
chip on troop movements of the same
conditions

891
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:20,899
appear you should see the sheepy you
right now i a hero point eight percent

892
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:22,440
of c_p_ you used

893
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,390
really nothing michael

894
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:28,209
or and here's my windows seven machine
using zero percent so you can use a

895
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:31,689
little in this attack now each one of
these dots is one hundred

896
00:42:31,689 --> 00:42:36,989
whatever judgments and there you go

897
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,579
looks like it's not going to do anything
to me

898
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:43,089
so i'm gonna switch to my backup machine

899
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:46,519
if you are killed it so much to respond
more or less what happened that's kind

900
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:47,519
of fun

901
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:52,098
because it's so bad i can't even show me
test manager anymore

902
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:55,729
and noticed that the ubuntu machine
distiller zero point five percent of the

903
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:58,739
kindergarten klein let's take a look
what happened limits machine are

904
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:01,879
noticing finally responded it's at a
hundred percent

905
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,169
and it will be at a hundred percent

906
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:09,118
for good long time uh... another company
was testing devices with korea guard

907
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,389
said that this machine had a backlog
before hours at one hundred percent

908
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:14,629
me

909
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:18,950
blackmun subaru equal should

910
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,379
so that would dismiss mister

911
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:25,538
mike ubuntu machine is doing fine here
unifying control c

912
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:30,739
and uh... look at the i_p_o_ dresses you
will see why coupon to is not as stupid

913
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:35,119
as windows now what is when does try to
join one hundred networks a second

914
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,669
i'm not really connecting one hundred
routers per second a my network host

915
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:40,140
bill good to be anyway

916
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,989
we're going to do stuff for print

917
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:46,029
it just ads the first ten or so and
ignores all the rest like anybody with

918
00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:47,960
any sense would be

919
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,769
uh...

920
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:52,660
that's why he doesn't suffer now his
mother windows machine over here and i

921
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,779
thought this one is kinda fun another
way

922
00:43:56,779 --> 00:43:59,619
let's see if i get to project

923
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:02,309
searching for source

924
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,309
so here's another poor little windows
machine here

925
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,279
needed you to use of a hundred percent

926
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:13,959
unified currency nothing at this team to
come to the point i think that's the

927
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:17,489
that's not even taking keystrokes or
anything there goes i think i'd be

928
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:22,019
compared

929
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:24,399
ritual in

930
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:28,659
and i might possibly be able to see some
of the i_p_o_ dresses is poor abused

931
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:30,819
machine has gotten

932
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:34,549
what's your people do anything at all

933
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:38,440
okay going to be able to print the first
line we may see some going by here

934
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,299
anyway what i wanted to show you here

935
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:45,829
which is kinda fun the c_b_o_'s own
hundred-percent not yet been able to

936
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:50,639
disable the adapter hidden network
connections it will stop the attack

937
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:53,499
i can no longer do because the machine
doesn't respond well enough

938
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:57,549
but this machine is using a usb attach
net

939
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:00,609
so i can do that

940
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:01,699
okay

941
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,389
the attacker stock

942
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:06,139
the network interface is gone

943
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:09,219
there's no place to put annuals i_p_
addresses

944
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:13,299
and yet it sits here at one hundred
percent and it will be a one

945
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:15,619
hundred-percent for a good long time

946
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:18,119
what is it doing

947
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,709
i would like somebody microsoft to
explain to me what is happening right

948
00:45:21,709 --> 00:45:25,759
now white is my machine using its
hydrogenated cebu

949
00:45:25,759 --> 00:45:29,889
attaching i_p_o_ dresses to interface
that is not even there

950
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:33,939
and doing god knows what group policy
and firewall settings

951
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,519
running around like to have to chasing
his tail

952
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:42,189
winners obviously no benefit to doing
house anyway on

953
00:45:42,189 --> 00:45:45,279
i think that's it that's all i wanted to
show you finally actually brought back

954
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:52,279
into some so right

955
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:56,689
and i guess i guess i have a couple
minutes of anybody have any questions

956
00:45:56,689 --> 00:46:00,038
if not i guess that's at the bottom part
of your family watch them all my stuff

957
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:07,039
available website

958
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:14,089
okay

959
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,679
static

960
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:22,479
ticket counter
