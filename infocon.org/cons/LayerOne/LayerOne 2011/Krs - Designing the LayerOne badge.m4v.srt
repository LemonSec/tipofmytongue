1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,100
okay

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,330
so how many view into the hardware
hacking village

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,990
over there how many have you have a
enjoyed your badges and enjoyed all the

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,299
speaker's staff badges

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:18,539
so

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,550
chris is here to give a talk about how
she went from not knowing what how any

7
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,340
of this works

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,529
to being awesome at it and designing
this

9
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:29,960
all around and on how they work and talk

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,860
well she's gonna talk about now we I'm a
little drunk yeah

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,870
she's gonna talk about a bunch other
projects and

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:44,870
chair on its

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,919
thank you guys a obviously you now know
who I am and what I'm here to talk about

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,160
so that ruins my first couples live
there a

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,449
over for anybody that didn't hear em

16
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm at my name is Chris and I remember
%uh vernal Spacelabs does the

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,090
hackerspace in downtown LA

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,760
I designed this year's a speaker and
staff badges

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,740
to picture vigilance the really cool

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,559
3d cube kinda blurry so I

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,890
how how all this started for me it was a
back last year at Def Con

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,229
as the first first time I but even
introduced to soldering

23
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:31,220
had no idea what it was did not anything
about electronics picked up

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,590
a little digital voltmeter from frys

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,360
did notable meter at the time was either
I dislike the display

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,320
and and I learned enough about
electronic sadat

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,889
during dusk on to go ahead and hack my
badge an

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,560
all I did was that option LED is from
coincidentally

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,619
a Disneyland toy and I just attach them
around

30
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,659
the outside the bad and use the

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,180
aluminum faceplate as a conductor to

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,710
my to Belize so it was as pretty cool

33
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,000
and some other things that also diane is
one my first and I'll largest projects

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,899
that I worked on

35
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,270
was I'll lady added docs boxes

36
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,900
I actually in the building 5 love them
because some crazy person

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,420
decided to buy them in bulk and then and
then have me

38
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,530
Anna solar all that so that I got most a
man

39
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,610
my soldering experience was was doing
the youth and this is also something

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,140
that I've worked on which is just

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,359
I'm its altman's should be RGB LED

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,620
I don't know if you guys are noticing a
pattern here

43
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,349
I like LED's and

44
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,890
and other than before I remember I have
no space labs were hacker space in

45
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,958
downtown Los Angeles were also

46
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,810
put running the hardware hacking village
bring in all of our equipment for

47
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,660
everybody

48
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,680
I am doing both the human and speaker
badges we

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,819
word free for everybody to come in and
show up on Tuesday this is when are we

50
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,540

grandmother other the picture I love

53
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,340
arco doing the breathalyzer badges for
last year's def con

54
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,680
so listen also something that we we've
been doing we have we have history have

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,150
a building badges a

56
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,409
we have a lot of different equipments at
an SL

57
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:35,899
we have a lotta you really nice said
like EMC machines a lot of nice ordering

58
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,129
I and stuff in

59
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,700
and some lasers this one is a 40 watt
laser

60
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,700
like to set fire and burn holes in stuff
but we're not all 0 work and no play

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,629
we we like to have fun every once in a
while here we have a

62
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,629
endo demonstrating his super long straw
hack

63
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:59,470
good

64
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,849
and as I said before we're not all work
and no play

65
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,189
we do go ahead and and and let loose
sometimes and sometimes will throw a

66
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,140
party every once in a while and

annually and that'll that'll be our New
Years Eve party though

72
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,949
the will have each year you should also
check out

73
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,790
pfister hackerspace 23b

74
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,840
located in the ninth gay and lesbian
community

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,960
community have and I'm 410 I'm sorry
it's on the border

76
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,330
I we were done a lot of projects that I
sell

77
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,770
irises this is our welcome to an SL

78
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,780
beginner service not project the Cylon

79
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,820
others is a.m. this one has

80
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,120
three speeds for the LED's also has two
different

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,699
I'm brightness level also has a POV mode

82
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,610
an with taxed this is an example

83
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,979
love the POV mode would be taped it to a

84
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,430
a fan and took a picture of it

85
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,100
at a couple tries to get this picture
because for some reason this island just

86
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,139
wouldn't stay

87
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,639
taped to the fan

88
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,870
look I'm sure you can imagine what
happened

89
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,440
we we we ended up trying to hide behind
desks and chairs and stuff

90
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,080
each time we tried but a known for some
reason

91
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,580
the the designer insisted on using

92
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,729
that chip with no leaves

93
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:52,979
no light no lakes for the beginner
surface mount project

94
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,460
so sweet we have we have high
expectations

95
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,690
and this is another picture above the
the POV setting

96
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,430
some text that we have in it as that
default

97
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,970
this was one of our first group bill
project

98
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,020
add this is up talks mark 3

99
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,740
it is then and and RFID clone and
simulator 2000

100
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,560
pictured here with our awesome antenna
maker

101
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,210
a.m. and it we

102
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,440
we could set the bar high with this one
because

103
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,090
bit nope nobody's actually made any of
these including the person that

104
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,219
created not actually ever been made

105
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,710
so why we don't how we didn't have any
pictures or

106
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,500
reference no threat to form that we
could go to for help

107
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,630
call around but you know that that's
what we wanted to do.

108
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,719
and the only one that we know %uh that's
actually being used is on

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,669
by virus and and Northern California
I'll thank you actually using it

110
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:59,710
as an RFID you reader

111
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,479
so this is not our style on chill

112
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,690
this was a upgrade to the Cylon one
Scott

113
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,389
30 LED is incentive the typical 9

114
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,569
and we also put them buttons on it so
you can play a role play some small

115
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,870
video games like

116
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,660
like pong or something take everybody
back to the nineteen seventies except

117
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,180
for with

118
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,389
West resolution and

119
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,430
it was also design using triplex thing

120
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,430
and that is basically means that there's
30 LED is and five pence

121
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,009
which is pretty of them a guy is one any
more information on Wed

122
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,910
tried texting is we have a 100
information on it on our way keep

123
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,240
and picture the

124
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,979
that is being made this is are

125
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,878
analogic which is our version %uh be

126
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,449
logic analyzer using the design
references by it

127
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,910
Cypress and

128
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,860
for some reason but like I said as
before that the designers not really

129
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,580
happy using a chip that has length

130
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,550
so for the next version who upgraded
that

131
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,680
an and again noting that this this
design was also

132
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,819
for beginners

133
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,949
liz is our crack and which is just are
USB AVR programmer

134
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,800
that was at a pace of the a USB ASP

135
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,000
and all of these projects are

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
and available as kids step for the pock
mark

137
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,269
in the hardware hacking village told you
guys are interested in building any of

138
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,019
these

139
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:49,850
and/or learning more about them we
actually had them for sale as kept

140
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,930
and now go and talk more about the patch

141
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,969
an so for my first

142
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,260
solo project all my own design and
creating

143
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,560
I'm boards I decided to build

144
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,479
a surface mount version love be evil mad
scientist labs

145
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,000
Peggy which is just a pipe or an LED
pegboard

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,430
and the reason I got this idea is cuz we
happen to have one

147
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,630
I had nastase which unfortunately was
broken

148
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,630
on during one of our parties

149
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,980
Sahar so we decided to go ahead

150
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,470
and so decided to build a smaller one

151
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,459
for this year's badges and and

152
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:37,739
re we figured out right at the beginning
that in order to keep it small enough

153
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,950
that it can be worn I am we're gonna
have to make a multiple layers

154
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,330
because there's no way that hold the
components and all the LED's and

155
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,690
everything would fit on the front a bit

156
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,760
and have it still be small enough to
wear

157
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,939
the Dodgers themselves at this point are
actually im

158
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,250
I am one of the smallest size a LED is
there there

159
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,329
6 by 3 millimeters there there

160
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:06,550
they're quite small so Adam

161
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,729
I don't think we could go much smaller
install solar the my hand

162
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,380
and but during the the

163
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,490
first design I went ahead and used to
bind and buried vs

164
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,930
I unfortunately it was going to cost two
thousand dollars

165
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:27,469
to have some sample boards made not even
all over the board just some sample one

166
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,899
so up a little bit out of our price
range

167
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,610
so we decided to scratch the

168
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,920
binding buried be is and have to do

169
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,050
through hole vs and and I i acknowledge
the fact that the people who created

170
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,870
this picture

171
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,000
don't know how to spell whole

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,410
and as you can see that the blind and
varied be is are

173
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,490
are just be is that go in between the
layers

174
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,100
incentive connecting all of the layers
and going to the whole board

175
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,380
and like is that as as a I had to
redesign the whole board from scratch

176
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,430
in order to go ahead and and fit in the
Eve they're completely through hole

177
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,069
V is cuz it was gonna take a lot more
space on the board and I was gonna have

178
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,410
to move components

179
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,060
around in order to fit around those and

180
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,890
sorry something we we send them to
Malaysia sent it to get built with a

181
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,810
one-week

182
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,560
turnaround time and two weeks later

183
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,099
they showed up after having after being

184
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,370
sent all around the globe and including
be

185
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,060
the recently earthquake ravaged Japan

186
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,529
not quite sure where they were sent to
Japan but

187
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:50,220
but I guess they wanted to check out
some other some other damage

188
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,760
and so once they arrive they started to
go ahead and

189
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,970
put on v total 8100

190
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,490
LED's by hand and

191
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,260
we we unfortunately don't have a pic in
place up and running

192
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,829
so we had to manually put all of these
on

193
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,709
and and then somebody put olive there

194
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,149
and LED is on backwards

195
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:24,829
so they had to at the end up being a
thousand 424 LED's

196
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:29,099
that were put on and noted that person's
me

197
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,660
head

198
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,680
a shot of the many many boards the
Highveld I ended up building

199
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,760
my particular one with commonalities
backwards

200
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,480
that was really fun to go ahead and fix

201
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,000
and and we finished all love this

202
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,360
out about 7 p.m. yesterday

203
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,680
an and

204
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,899
it here here's a picture have some %uh
them being

205
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,200
being hot plated and re we use this
method because it was gonna be a lot

206
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,769
faster then soldering them all by hand

207
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,430
and although I did take some time to put
the mall on their

208
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,569
that way they cannot just be in you
heated up even lean

209
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,950
and and and melted altogether

210
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,079
I'm yet me I we learned the lesson

211
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:24,540
to not tell people to just do the best
you can me

212
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,490
when they're helping because than the
boards won't work

213
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,430
and and re real

214
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,609
you may recognize the hotel bathroom at
bathroom sink

215
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,540
as we were trying to fix those errors
during

216
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,079
during registration this morning and

217
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,599
summit from the LED's alan is not
working and and and

218
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,100
that but that's what happens when you
have free labor and

219
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,170
so a Dubai

220
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,389
experience a the mild learning
experience I've started teaching

221
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,629
at null space and anytime

222
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:09,579
a time people common show up like I said
we usually have them build the Cylon

223
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:15,120
as you guys saw earlier an and so I I
tried it

224
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,439
try to go ahead and teach people the way
it works and and the

225
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:22,550
the electronic behind it and and

226
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,370
so that they had a better understanding
and an hour they can teach people when

227
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,160
they come back

228
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,899
and I actually have one up here so that
you guys can see

229
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,029
what it does those nude in the back I'm
not sure if you can see it cuz in a

230
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:36,660
small

231
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,660
but it's got it's got three speed good

232
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,500
and the POV mode which

233
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,060
we have the text maybe not visible

234
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,089
but an effort and

235
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,660
so I i teach I teach people how to build
those

236
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,589
and this guy was quite happy with his
bill

237
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,709
and I find I finally Tronix pretty
exciting

238
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,739
but apparently he found them even more
exciting

239
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,180
yeah

240
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:20,380
so learn anybody have any questions yes

241
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,750
absolutely nothing I don't know if you
guys I didn't bother

242
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,590
rapid no I

243
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,720
I worked in retail before this

244
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,740
I don't know if you guys a read the bio
on the program

245
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,130
but I grew up in the valley and and

246
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:43,430
usually spend my time at at malls and
movies in

247
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,630
all that stuff I had no idea Wed

248
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,689
electronics was let soldering was

249
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,260
even what Def Con was until just last
year

250
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,040
so all other stuff that I've been able
to do and work on

251
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,870
has been within you know less than a
year

252
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,270
to you no facing death

253
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,540
and from the mall I wasn't used to it

254
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,680
I am I was introduced to a person a
friend of a friend of mine

255
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,089
and and he he goes left on

256
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,960
each year and so I was kinda interested
in what it was I heard that there is an

257
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,110
from some lockpicking going on I heard
about the hardware hacking village in

258
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,860
and I knew some people that had had gone
before

259
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,150
coincidentally that we're going to be
there so I I figured why not

260
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,400
home and and I just spent the whole time
in the hardware hacking village just

261
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,170
just learning and just watching other
people other people make other

262
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,880
and packs on their badges then and Qatar
kinda

263
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,850
pic people's brains about what was going
on and what everybody was doing an

264
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,750
and I was pretty excited I ended up
coming out I have an actual really hot

265
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,060
and

266
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,260
a bad accident with a soldering iron and
i've seen

267
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,380
lot of those happen her and and then
that's when I ran into the people at

268
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,570
null space labs

269
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,550
there they had to be AC the the
breathalyzer bad be AC bad

270
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,829
that they had done and put together an
and you know that that was really

271
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,569
popular

272
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,980
and you know as a the picture with a and
a straw

273
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,660
I know you could have been but the we're
we're length a move on

274
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,740
one of them then testing a mound of
kinda really great place just those out

275
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,040
looted an in-depth

276
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,810
embankment yet

277
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:38,310
I'm a bigger version of the batch

278
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:45,310
I wanna see how big a king added: a

279
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,510
heap

280
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,160
all a we'll see

281
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,910
nothing bit as big as I can get it but
rather

282
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,450
yet other bad

283
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:07,010
for by 60 you no hood

284
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,660
s while is up if you're doing better

285
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,870
are vast can you more the that

286
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,370
you used or more

287
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,959
I can do it I I

288
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,810
can do it on the pins on using the chips
that we have because the way that this

289
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,740
bad to set up

290
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,830
it's got the the main ship which is an
80 make a 328

291
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:37,379
and and then it's connected to you and

292
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,880
to shift registers and two LED drivers
so I'm actually not using

293
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,280
all of these pins and but it wasn't

294
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,240
small enough to of it on one should
register and one LED driver

295
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,100
using worshipers yeah I can using these
existing chips go all the way up to

296
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,300
625 LED's

297
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,050
am so 225 by 25 is that

298
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:09,080
that's without lopsided that slotting
more compatible

299
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,810
I would have to then add the the
corresponding transistors in

300
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,970
resistors now the stuff that would be
needed for the actual LED

301
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,390
Rosa Valley these themselves but I
wouldn't have to add

302
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,490
anymore act anymore chip search any
other

303
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,970
and talk component like that so

304
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,270
it can be twice as big almost

305
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,639
get actually on

306
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
unions all Burzum

307
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,090
we can all learn up yeah although no

308
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,209
yet terrible

309
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,300
here of

310
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:53,710
and implement funny all yet using the
ship is is a leader is

311
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,240
yes one thing that person this is that
he's actually

312
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,090
neither yet rate applies

313
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,199
do it moscow's see that vacuum is
actually

314
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,290
higher you can use pretty eventually

315
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,210
ship just basic thank you

316
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,850
yet a okay

317
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,100
so it one-to-one after that mean that

318
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,139
is not of a

319
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,210
I having gone that question yet actually

320
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,890
so maybe maybe people are just a little
shy to come up and ask me if there's a

321
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,090
cock on my baddd

322
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:40,090
but there's not and not to mention that
they would be a cock with some pretty

323
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,280
odd a

324
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,280
some growth Sonnen for that shape so I
really hope that it's not

325
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,820
hood area

326
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,080
did you call the up

327
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,810
the he exacted rising

328
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,879
we're giving up were

329
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,570
it was a little bit about I'm being that
it was my first board

330
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,590
designing and laying out all by myself I
I did she little bit and

331
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,520
and go off for the payee schematic but
because the fact that I am

332
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,629
we were making a service numbers in a
bit we need to do find different parts

333
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,940
and because we wanted to make it smaller

334
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,490
we needed to find like the the
transistors

335
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,380
for instance on here are jewel PNP
transistors so that means that there's

336
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,530
one component

337
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,050
takes place up to answer able to

338
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,070
downsized the overall size

339
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,080
for that component as well and and also
the way that the

340
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,879
the schematic is available for the Peggy
is not

341
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,400
and and a format where you can just
uploaded Eagle

342
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,180
so it's just a PDF that I mean I had to

343
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,210
I had to lay it all out anyway so summer
the wiring and things like that and

344
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,270
I I did go of our venues as a guide and
then I did go ahead and make

345
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,010
modifications to different components
and

346
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,360
and wire up be LED drivers and shift
registers a little differently

347
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,830
but so so it's a little bit about

348
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,790
the job I should

349
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:29,710
got an excellent question i havent I am
learning

350
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,200
a some other programming stuff and but

351
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,310
Malata that is done by by other people
that have more programming experience

352
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,980
at NSL so I was able to go and work
through

353
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,910
work with them on what was put in the
badges and and

354
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,030
what codes were available and would fit
I am

355
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,410
but I'm still learning the programming
aspect of it

356
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,950
so I wouldn't be able to explain to you
confidently

357
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,520
have an hour worked sorry

358
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,810
anybody else really

359
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,720
at all

360
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,840
it's pretty awesome looking oh yeah

361
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,889
for them follow he passed

362
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,170
I figured somebody

363
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,220
might affect question and yet
comparative

364
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,950
a lot of debate on which batteries to
use and and how to power it up

365
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,140
I am quite a long debate involving
several people

366
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,990
and each person had a different opinion
as to which battery was going to be

367
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,730
better and we went back and forth

368
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,190
an we ended up using from most to them

369
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,860
2450 is and because that's just what
happened to be ordered

370
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,810
so the actual proper battery I am wasn't
even

371
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,659
wasn't even ordered so and it works for
the most part

372
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,210
on but then some love them some oh so
the 24 fifties are ordered

373
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,500
we got a discount and unfortunately they
just didn't work that well

374
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,310
so then we ended up having to stack to

375
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,830
2032 an orange cat the same

376
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,879
the and the same amperage in involved in
everything

377
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,640
so the the batteries was was definitely
a learning experience

378
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,490
an email

379
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,930
yes

380
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,390
my is the only pink purple that

381
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,820
I am and

382
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,620
an Ashes cuz because I got to choose my
color and we made these

383
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,770
others because I didn't know if you guys
have noticed but they're all blue we try

384
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,110
to make those pretty uniform

385
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,449
and of course remade the staff badges

386
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:47,260
red so those early I mean those are
pretty uniform colors and colors that

387
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,080
are use we wanted to make sure the
people would be able to identify

388
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,850
who was who won the badges even though
one it scrolls it tells you

389
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,620
but you may not be reading it are paying
attention you may just be looking at the

390
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,080
fact that it's blinking at you

391
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,820
which is just fine too yes

392
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:11,820
yeah pink purple means design but the
next one question

393
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,730
I'm I think that maybe datagram shoulda
Anthony Alan

394
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,980
up

395
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,940
do

396
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,240
I saying oh yes sir

397
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,470
speaker speakers day going out

398
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,470
speaker like yeah

399
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,169
figure out how to add

400
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:49,789
good a and and and he's not going into
that much detail as the really was

401
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,519
because he had to be

402
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,610
he decided to be a big critical on that
text

403
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,330
size a vua up the tax on the badly I was
printed

404
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,279
sorry sauce several provisions that just
said speaker

405
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:06,409
but didn't make it known to me that it
needed to be changed

406
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:10,039
so he had he had the overall approval

407
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:17,039
on the text on the bad shit should

408
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,090
no nothing

409
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:27,168
month ago ready

410
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,090
I'm I had pink and purple

411
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,158
yes how much

412
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,239
word you where well

413
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:42,159
it depends on whether or not you doing
fine and baby is a thrill bien

414
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,190
because the having the plane and a baby
is make that

415
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,480
slightly easier I mean a four-layer
board is

416
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,109
is naturally complex because you're
having to wire things

417
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:56,789
on on multiple layers and so you're
you're not just seen

418
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:00,989
an near front and back your and you're
also not able to make

419
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:05,629
a prototype board as easily because even
with the CNC machine that we have in all

420
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:06,149
space

421
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:09,428
as still as only able to do two sides

422
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:13,330
I'm so that's another you then lion

423
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,289
why we had to wait two weeks to even
test the board

424
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:20,450
because we can make one ourselves and

425
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,869
but it it if you have to find a baby is
it makes it

426
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,899
makes it a little bit easier because you
can place components on the front and

427
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:28,418
back

428
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:31,950
pretty much wherever you want to. but
when you have to design it with the

429
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,080
through hole be is

430
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,779
you have to design you have to replace
all the components

431
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,909
on either side around

432
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:45,019
your wiring so it it's a lot more take
it takes a lot more time

433
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:50,190
fell alright

434
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:57,190
all on

435
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,670
are coming up next in a few minutes will
be the building the Def Con network talk

436
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,330
with Mac and they would run

437
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,790
so you like to see that just stay tuned
thanks

438
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:14,330
just let it go and and one more thing
remember that all the stuff she talked

439
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,149
about is available hardware hacking
village

440
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,750
to be like that chase Chris over there
and asked about the kids

441
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:26,750
fact line my batteries ran out at the
axe

442
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,050
perfect
