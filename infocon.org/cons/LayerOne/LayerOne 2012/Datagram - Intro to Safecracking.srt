1
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:11,029
every year

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,470
so

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,759
nomination most

4
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,779
stuff in the US eyes are

5
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:31,849
things you

6
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:35,730
use this walk after you basically want

7
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,610
weird so

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,769
these locks as you probably already here
really

9
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:46,940
back amassed locker

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,940
three dollars but just the way there
basically

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,890
sisters CMOS

12
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,360
world ever you know the more you start

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,729
walks notice water everywhere an
important step

14
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:15,020
or equal version here

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:22,020
so

16
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,240
me going back

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,759
we make have March and basically worship

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,170
is way that this poll places

19
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,430
spring peace when you dial in

20
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,530
combo long shackle doing is pieces
freedom

21
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,909
back there's many other ways you can
open the shackle

22
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,770
without working this really beat up

23
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,560
with with basically every conference
ever

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,659
so what's really funny Sophia actually
just push the peace

25
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,909
way shackle retracted again this is a

26
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,780
block same concept applies to a brand
new one

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,420
may be harder to push directly the pic
also monster

28
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,000
again first shames

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,900
question is is we want to be able to
display shop

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,250
thing that retains the shop essentially

31
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,850
what we're doing dialed allowing these
pieces to disconnect

32
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,600
shop make

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:41,600
shares

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,420
alright naturalistic

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,480
to mention the reasons why these workers

36
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,780
spring just

37
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,810
knows pulled because it's not a speck

38
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,790
them in the case locks lol

39
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,970
open is a few dollar college again and

40
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,450
field there you go

41
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,940
but users

42
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,090
you up

43
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,870
way to

44
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,060
okay

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,970
star up

46
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,630
good

47
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,890
two-inches' very things here

48
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,950
peace picture and eventually good

49
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:54,950
right sure market

50
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,240
just

51
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:10,240
16 and you can make

52
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:17,570
marks

53
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,090
mark Nick

54
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,960
wanna make very edges

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,810
used don't route

56
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,590
nice Shea all basically 12

57
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,590
search it Terry here's okay and actually
here

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,850
slightly thicker I think this actually
orange juice

59
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,070
a little and

60
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,909
are here

61
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,919
100

62
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,080
little

63
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,130
or it works the problem is

64
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,789
I mean that's what the mass production
their best right steel

65
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:27,570
course they're using very big machine
hooker

66
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,270
re: I think the zip

67
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,049
basic like this at all ready black

68
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,770
your wallet where with if the need ever
arises

69
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,020
person matter if the need arises

70
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,650
all just show you turnip

71
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:53,650
p.m. old

72
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,880
the first step is your fold it down to
that satellite use the lines you drew is

73
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,460
a guide

74
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,760
for legs ramzi

75
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,760
was also helps reinforce the handle

76
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:16,650
history like world

77
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,900
edges around picture sure parts

78
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,010
yeah

79
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,150
and then what you can do it you just
want to make this round's

80
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,419
it's the curvature shackle you do with
the shackle

81
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,490
you do with hand in everything just

82
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:41,490
nice rounds

83
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,248
here

84
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:51,899
now if you look at it now it'll make
more sense why the edges rockers

85
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:54,989
really flat edges to be easier for this
middle East

86
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:58,568
care not household

87
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,789
up

88
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,949
so you can view is

89
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:09,539
ish shocker retainers on the side
obviously you know that beforehand

90
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,759
sometimes each to ship both sides double
word

91
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,610
little other have lost touch these these
once a single

92
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,699
so here

93
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,249
hitch

94
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:28,499
ours turning around its

95
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:35,499
in between shackle up

96
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,030
good rip

97
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,109
so happens to be doing wrong care the
shame

98
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,180
obvious you black jail it happens

99
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,710
expect another gonna make

100
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,198
on make so that happens

101
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,289
and of a box have a bunch Shin

102
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,610
second first

103
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:18,610
up

104
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,380
yeah has been spent

105
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,850
one

106
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,640
something there

107
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,360
up

108
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,209
is that it's also possible to the club
by feel now

109
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,619
with this method you don't get the
combination directly when the shackles

110
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,660
hoping you could actually

111
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,490
figure out published by poking and
prodding inside but

112
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,760
there's also a way to do it just by feel
without making tools

113
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,740
not worried about shames obviously takes
a little bit more time

114
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,630
issue sitting there but I'll but it's
just as effective

115
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,839
Katie pretty quickly one

116
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,170
funny thing is that easier so poorly
made that they actually make it easier

117
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:07,640
for you

118
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,910
than you might think so there's forty
numbers on a combination 00:02:39

119
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,410
so you know we have three numbers are
combinations

120
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,730
many combinations be a lock brake all

121
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,860
theoretically law but the way it works
is that

122
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,200
when you down your combo to come with
10-20 third

123
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,459
you can probably dial 9

124
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,410
30 11 2013 variations that reach number

125
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,219
between because the way this works is
that has a certain tolerance

126
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,370
so that you don't have to dial exactly
correctly on the line every time to make

127
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,420
it will be easier

128
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,990
more user-friendly so we can use this to
reduce

129
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,370
the key space essentially and these
locks they have a really big tolerance

130
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,860
I think it's something crazy like plus
or minus two the actual number you want

131
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,480
to work

132
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,010
so in actuality it's 240 numbers we have

133
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,310
I'm basically slightly

134
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,709
you know given to some variants but
about ten members for dial

135
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:09,029
what we can also do is exploit problem

136
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:12,610
Skype locked let's just figure out what
are the numbers right away

137
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,010
so if we know one another the numbers in
the combination and the other two wheels

138
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,730
lamp 10

139
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,820
possibility each we only have a 100
company to try

140
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,010
reports really quickly and there's some
more advance

141
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,380
mathematical stuff that you can do to
figure out even faster

142
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,490
but the basic idea is that you gonna
pull on the shackle what pulling on the

143
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,180
shackle does is it directly

144
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,680
tries to push the retainer into the
gates inside

145
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,109
we'll talk more about how these work
internally we get to see wats by

146
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,760
such as little wheels with gays when you
can you put the gate

147
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,579
right position we pull the shackle were
pushing against those gates

148
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,979
trying to turn the dial fine or stop

149
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,470
I can't turn the dial more than from
about 26

150
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,680
tours 27 and so

151
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,260
okay we know that we can go from 26 to
27 like go

152
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,779
a little bit all again the next part we
get stuck in

153
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,240
is 29 and a half 230

154
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,260
30 in so you gonna do this all around
the dial

155
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,770
wannabes more gaps different so what
these are

156
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,920
falls gates if you just trying to pull
there were no gates you would just be

157
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,029
able to click install the correct
positions

158
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,540
issue pushing the peace directly wheels
so with this post

159
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,770
try to make it hard to manipulate but it
actually has the effect letting us just

160
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,370
figure out

161
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,630
last number of combinations right way so
again I'm not considered

162
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,240
all the way but you're gonna all Shack
write all this down

163
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,550
and then up these or gaps one of them
will be in how to wire

164
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,399
bigger be smaller it varies depending on
brand

165
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,060
model that in the master locks it
typically a slightly bigger

166
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,420
day and that's because they want to be
easier for you to find you'd

167
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,430
I'm has after you have that lets say are
numbered

168
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,479
is 6 down six all

169
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,040
the the other two numbers we offsets for
from the number six because the way the

170
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,839
mass-produced

171
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,050
so what you know the last number six

172
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,529
you're gonna die I'll 006 046 you're
just gonna run through the 100

173
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:16,689
combinations really quickly

174
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,329
and ideally find it within 50 and Allen
50 nations

175
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:24,810
pretty quick and then you would have the
combination

176
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,069
be able to come back so it it takes
patience and practice

177
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,810
the first time you do it will be the
hardest if you do it once

178
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,430
every subsequent be here so there's a
lot of these on the table

179
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,589
you guys wanna practice just start by
pulling on the shackle

180
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,410
finding all these okayed figuring out
which one is different

181
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,469
and therefore yep then you can try the
other

182
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,000
nations up don't care about the

183
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,170
collisions said which basically just
makes them

184
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,750
for us harbors to maintain that pressure

185
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,020
as rotates around inside look and I have

186
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,089
week grip so I use all players I'd

187
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,140
you know stutter when you tried and now

188
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:16,140
should be pollution do below and yes

189
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,300
try this on the site tried nice

190
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,410
lock yet but ones I have a her little
bit lesbian up

191
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,010
but you know is very easy just you

192
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,449
what i'd can 30 yup

193
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,400
yeah yeah nicely and I think I'm

194
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,529
grosses but if anyone else has been
drinking a coke and what just

195
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:49,120
wash the sickness away gets me that yep

196
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,120
really good

197
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:06,620
the other fun stuff

198
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,290
sesame arts or just you know they're
there another for combinations box

199
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,339
but observed

200
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,420
but that's because probably the most
popular

201
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,000
brand in the US law successfully so yeah

202
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,459
previously okay

203
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,800
so these are very similar just

204
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,199
three wheels four wheels number

205
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,540
unlike obviously the dial one yes
individual tiles for individual wheels

206
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,560
in the way these work is that when you
whole the shackle

207
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,410
these discs are physically blocking you
turn on the right positions

208
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,610
it's very similar o'clock it's just a
different way of doing it

209
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,420
I'm I would say that these are
considerably easier to manipulate

210
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,250
I'm just based on their design don't
need to worry about tiling and

211
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,269
making sure you dialed sequence that's a
big problem for

212
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,940
for people who use a fox losses dollar
with this

213
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,790
he said 123 or whatever I'll way this
works

214
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,890
pretty much the same movies here you

215
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,069
put pressure on the shackle some you
have to push down but I think

216
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,399
we own you pull up you pull up

217
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,850
test each wheel so if you

218
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,199
don't fall movies we'll very freely when
you poll

219
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,859
the shackles gonna be pushing against
one or more up wheels

220
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,860
at right now so when you try and turn it
to see this one moves justice really

221
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,990
this one is a little bit harder this was
really hard so what that is

222
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,649
shackle lining up against you should
wheels a different way

223
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:47,660
and just like when we work with the were
locked each of these wheels

224
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,410
mind in sequence because the way the
shackles pushing up against it can

225
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,089
really

226
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,240
be manufactured against all up same time

227
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,690
so where you could use work each wheel
individuals poll

228
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,870
I found that the first one gives less
resistance an attorney

229
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,260
Hill you looking

230
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,220
place so long as

231
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,199
also important whenever you look at
these urged a magic J shape

232
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,189
especially with the shackles is starts
way up here goes round

233
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,730
just like that and so on havel on this
site shackle

234
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,310
is course to model which is that
possible with little

235
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,709
fluctuations those last for two shins

236
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:32,180
you know course are being blocked by
these gates just sold smile

237
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,520
but when these are aimed at corrects
number

238
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,550
of course the whole games United

239
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,790
you have this little gates right here at
this flag is trying to

240
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,130
through it care right so tall rotates

241
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,640
there's the gate is exposed and the flag
temperatures will rape

242
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,510
30 really easy

243
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,910
I know I didn't say anything cuz all I'm
doing is just pulling in turning

244
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:03,920
things like in a place you can all do
this he's

245
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,920
you guys to pass around

246
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,459
as obviously four wheels takes a little
bit more effort

247
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,419
and three wheels but there's actually
the same thing real

248
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,779
such as on the shackle

249
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:25,359
find which we or this resistance and
Internet

250
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,168
you look like see if the next we'll his
first

251
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:36,169
and saw next is

252
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,689
saves safe boxer essentially big boy

253
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,409
versions me walk very similar

254
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:50,559
all and we have a bunch other

255
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,649
matter what a boxer look very different
I

256
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:58,949
and most to them work on the same
principles to this one you have a dollar

257
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,529
bottom

258
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:03,730
in a big pot so instead of pulling off a
shock all or persons shackle you push

259
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,360
the button

260
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,269
directly increase you feel you get

261
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:13,419
here expect skates we have a couple the
you play

262
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:17,220
for this was actually easier to just
here

263
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,230
dial caliper just squeeze it

264
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,049
well you're manipulating any feel about
lower and lower

265
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:30,908
until it opens shared test this one in
particular is called national

266
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,490
axis national one different names in
different countries

267
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,789
has urged dictate speed

268
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:41,299
believed and

269
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,490
social joystick what you do value up
down left right

270
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,139
whatever is actually I in theory heard

271
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:52,219
fermentations at a certain point you

272
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,200
reset everything given point of 23

273
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,309
movements forest

274
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:04,190
becomes Nani so you can put whatever you
want was

275
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,309
back up it varies

276
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:10,918
a randomized sup use this like its four

277
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,260
like down up down down here that's

278
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,669
acting are you see prairie complex
inside its kinda hard to explain

279
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:22,950
essentially every time you this moving
five different things

280
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,669
so happens that in a bit that front but
not here

281
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:29,809
all that does is Moo this place and

282
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:32,870
probably can't see it from there but
this place has many many

283
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,709
little protrusion those projections

284
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,770
go around these

285
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,010
specially shaped dis that pusher

286
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,220
as well and so he's got like a strictly
smell or it

287
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,710
you can kinda see if you move up on us
you know we all knew

288
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,100
up a certain amount and then go down a
move a certain you

289
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,289
up go to that push go down

290
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,010
them inside so these are designed that
has a striptease

291
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,639
going any side of them will move them
pre describing their

292
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,860
all or happen so you can pass that
around your

293
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,559
make Street yep but it's actually really

294
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,178
ingenious cool design if you want to
know more about it there you just restin

295
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,309
yeah ship years they all turn together

296
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,918
wanna know more about you can go to tool
.nl and they're actually little visual

297
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,270
visualization tool just and flashing

298
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,809
can't play with it you can see how the
internals all so

299
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,529
is everything about sex

300
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:40,710
seats are very similar but also very
different same basic idea

301
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,720
number wheels past

302
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,820
where the ideas you've number wheels

303
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,070
and their brought by the dial positioned
correctly

304
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,668
arm up on top all gates

305
00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:01,669
obviously inside

306
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:06,029
are several your it's called the wheel
and then on the back

307
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:10,230
what's known as the drive cam so the
drive cam is directly connected

308
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,340
spindle stacked dial much you

309
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,959
movies wheels to and fro and if you look
to see the big cut out

310
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,649
is the gate very similar to the old

311
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:27,689
many paradox but obviously made a lot
nicer at a metal

312
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,529
classic young

313
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:40,529
our world

314
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,870
the basic mechanism by which openness
you start

315
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,330
position all wheels so that their true
gated

316
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,439
harmony arms called the fence that he
said the arms

317
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
defense use couple ever and 11 knows

318
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,830
which is the point part as well
interfaces with the track here

319
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,040
started Hills

320
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,570
all all their case here when you read

321
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,659
drive back have rooms

322
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,490
knows lever pollen what's up

323
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,470
retractable with the drive and I believe

324
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,370
the plastic one has come forward

325
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,659
I'll 6

326
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,890
have number ratings typically when you
buy

327
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,850
hardware store usually by

328
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,090
fires so safe sir distinguish between
being

329
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,990
fire resistant or element or

330
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,450
burglary resistant that's what most
people don't nackt

331
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,360
they go sage berkeley well not
necessarily

332
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,100
the Sentry Safe I resisted not burglars
and it's also worth noting is an answer

333
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
in the IT field

334
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,439
a fire resistant safe probably is not
require system for electronic media such

335
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,900
tapes that certain things

336
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,100
all the title see old Thursday's likable
a backup tapes

337
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,389
right no fire comes they're still gonna
be hot enough to

338
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,020
Diaz so happen fires the

339
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,320
I did

340
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,770
is material allied see ways

341
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,850
fired

342
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,070
which keeps the papers from reaching

343
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,200
him to: their user

344
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,790
number him electronic

345
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,940
yep

346
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,320
yeah and i'm looking about all the
ratings but there's just a number

347
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,810
group that great saves in the US it's
typically underwriters laboratory

348
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,690
well you well 768 media the standard

349
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,990
for safe walks in this country Europe
its and

350
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,890
yes in a number of organisations product

351
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,770
so it seems can be attacked in a number
of ways

352
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,540
today we're just talk about manipulation
rock

353
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,600
talk about fun stuff like thermal access
even on their

354
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,520
or blowing brother on

355
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,990
up I because that's no fun right

356
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,110
past all fun to watch but

357
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:37,709
what you do once manipulated however is
quite and

358
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,090
on

359
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,550
no quotes

360
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,690
I will tell you so when you dial
combination

361
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,800
this fence and lever here

362
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,940
are spring loaded down they want to go
into the true gates

363
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,179
but they can only do that when all the
gate sir i want I can only

364
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,060
all the way down when all the gates
underneath the facts

365
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,340
but how can we expect that you'll notice

366
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,350
if you pick up all the wheels by turning
one direction over an overkill

367
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:14,550
pick up one two or three wheels pick up
all the emails you still hear that noise

368
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:19,290
what annoys here one sec

369
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,570
click what that is what that is

370
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,178
actually bands next lever knows

371
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:29,910
falling down camp there you could feel

372
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,320
and right now you here possibly not

373
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,809
all between you and the law you can feel
that

374
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:41,260
on the dock your that point and visually

375
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,610
you can identify where these two points
are should be each side at the drive cam

376
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,949
K this side is thats

377
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,960
seven and three-quarters

378
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,490
three-quarters to sting decide

379
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,720
that 65 entry missile area

380
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,630
here what happens

381
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,690
is when you take all the

382
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,830
we'll tak just turned into an arbitrary
location you come back

383
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,790
your those points are you probably get
that same reading

384
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,820
back for but when there's a gate

385
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,730
underneath the fence you will be able to
drop just a little bit lower

386
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,790
now there's no material there just like
are other come along just like

387
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,530
somewheres tolerances with all these
wheels with the lever

388
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,310
the picture you have three wheels like
this now they're not all going to be

389
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,280
perfectly level

390
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,120
one could be a little bit higher one of
the desks a little bit over certain

391
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,010
points higher

392
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,169
the offense itself could be a little bit
better offenses like this

393
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,300
think which these things first so all
these at a

394
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,220
just like an lock to this idea

395
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,500
we're gonna be able to identify when a
gay

396
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,760
is under the pants by visual and visual

397
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,270
feedback on the dial dollars tangible be
back with you

398
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,690
field points there's a lot to take

399
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,990
something you really need to sit down
and you it's hard to explain

400
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,669
it's hard to understand but way it works
is that has you

401
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:20,470
borges defense that

402
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,210
levered is able to go lower and lower
and obviously when all the right

403
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:24,840
position

404
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,330
all the way down so by picking up all
the wheels

405
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,439
stop 0 when you come back

406
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,600
test that point it

407
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,449
test that point all the way around the
time by taking diagnostics

408
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,540
identifying how hard Oct 14 go

409
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,560
gay here you can identify where the
wheels are

410
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,120
and that's because as you get wheels
under this

411
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,310
lever go lower as it goes lower into
this be shaped

412
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,560
it has less movement back for

413
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,610
think the dynamics of this as you go
lower

414
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:04,418
back class there's also other ways to
tell for example it's not only

415
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:07,919
when do you go lower but also the way
that this design

416
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,030
the lower a little higher the bomb

417
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,100
there's a lot of different things with
you to crack say

418
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:22,100
good hard

419
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,550
are there any questions I know it's hard
to it listen to you

420
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:31,710
you really should sit down with the
cutaways play with it to learn more

421
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:38,160
and also who has last piece

422
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,820
no questions there is a master of

423
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,210
so

424
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,480
jonathan is my safe as a lever on it
open

425
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,880
door so what that is either a you have
what's called direct drive safe

426
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,640
where the lever physically pushes into
you the lever on the door

427
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,220
physically pushes into you wheels or

428
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,610
physically pushes into the bolts can't
fully turned into a ball to this type

429
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,840
walk is your check never waste because
sometimes the

430
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,860
the act you might wanna you know most

431
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,030
you're safe really have a lot of walking
points very big balls

432
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,480
and turning this little dial just a
little bit not do it

433
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,500
that's right secondary handle tackle is
it like a sentry safe and

434
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,480
second probably drop which is easier to
manipulate

435
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,950
because you just like these combo locks
physically push yourself in the case

436
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,230
to get the other questions

437
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:46,230
I am

438
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,220
the question was what are the
differences between different brands

439
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,540
safe locks homes a

440
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,250
Commission yes go to recombination I

441
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:04,000
so there's differences between the big
boys like sergeant really

442
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,720
Lagarde Diebold Nosler

443
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,010
but for the most part every time you go

444
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,040
like the same kind town you're probably
going to be fine this

445
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,700
exact law just the standard sergeant
Greenlee block and the standard box from

446
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,059
the other companies are all very very
very similar

447
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,309
they very if not almost minuscule like

448
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:29,350
almost nothing except logo on the back
will be different I am

449
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,059
the real differences when you you wanna
buy high-security say

450
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,399
or lower scores such as century yard

451
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,550
sec or any number of fire seems

452
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,600
which people don't associate with not
being resist

453
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,889
I'm so one example we have this

454
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,520
is surgeon greenleaf the 400

455
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,960
they also 8500 which I think personally

456
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,080
way this works

457
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,230
is that you can see the cam looks
considerably different

458
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:07,130
shoes AP story here so what that is

459
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,450
arms together to physically block that
little part on the cam

460
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,990
from being accessible by the lever until
you have to practice

461
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,900
nation and so it doesn't stop you from
taking diagnostics

462
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,520
but it does the point is to make it much
longer

463
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,590
so we rate see fire or

464
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,360
terms it terms like you can't

465
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,570
say most saves the their

466
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,639
10 minutes or 15 minutes 30 minutes I'm

467
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,280
all the way up to 20 hours an hour so
could be one guy working hours together

468
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,710
hours I'm this I believe israeli for

469
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:50,130
tap

470
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,370
its allotted

471
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,928
yes because these

472
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:02,170
standardized you write you l

473
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,190
or the other standards organizations to
say this is passed

474
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,860
this many hours whatever you lockpick

475
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,689
drilling or fire resistance I now

476
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,770
you may have doubts as to whether or not
standards companies actor

477
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,470
test which is a big thing with box
whether or not

478
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,530
it's really 15 minutes resistance
because

479
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:30,879
they may not radio as other people
standardized

480
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,919
testing but for the most part

481
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,440
I think all say with this order

482
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,080
law because US Army their hours

483
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,620
well first off there in the door area

484
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,939
that safer another thats

485
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,869
their rating

486
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:58,629
I'm actually just as quick note sorry if
you're passing it around

487
00:32:58,629 --> 00:33:02,658
make sure not butterfly switch with
upside down because the

488
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:05,859
then the whole Hartl actually yet don't
put that what's up

489
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,369
just like you have make it the back is
up and then

490
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:14,070
it the other way of all this used to
having a black

491
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,739
yeah your open up

492
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:21,979
really

493
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:25,829
range numbering being yes

494
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:29,339
ok guys with really yeah

495
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:32,769
his and he acts loved

496
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:36,469
yeah he doing yeah the question was

497
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:40,539
one in the ratings mean those are on
writers say

498
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:44,209
and they have a code system that'll tell
you really quickly if you understand

499
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:45,769
when it should be rated

500
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:49,499
or so Intl stands for tools jack stands
for

501
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:52,509
explosives I don't know all patients

502
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:55,669
yep

503
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:59,579
I think he arched orange an actual
notice of that state law

504
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,418
that's what we call group one are safe
what's the group one refers to them

505
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,929
relations and the are on there actually
if you notice

506
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:10,240
those discs are not men they're actually
very

507
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,658
or Rep and gathered or so basically what
happens

508
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,759
is if you were to use a x-trail not be
able to see the positions

509
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:22,139
the dates are saturated for history

510
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,869
lodged I also just be whether or not it
s

511
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:29,750
against mean on the margins our
apartment

512
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,069
yeah I do what if you were looking
forward to seeing you

513
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:37,949
yes you don't need whatsoever behind the
same he might be slightly

514
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:42,210
Osbourne evident during FBI its
considerations nonetheless

515
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,418
this lock

516
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:49,259
I am that actually is no longer
production their place that would

517
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:52,429
500 series and actually used to be the
GSA

518
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,500
recommended approval and they've
actually done away with these

519
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,579
if you want to be GSA approved for

520
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:02,349
much any hi scary top-secret they have
what's called the

521
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:05,930
hablamos exxon it's basically

522
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,118
your help so basically

523
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,230
its it all electronic its

524
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,619
as a base to happen go up to it you need
to spend first

525
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:18,960
to generates electricity so it will be a
run

526
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,279
and then there's lots and lots of
different

527
00:35:22,279 --> 00:35:26,500
action safe lock introduces like for
example one thing is

528
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,289
you look at how circle of course work
they're very precise

529
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:33,619
just being running like that very

530
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:36,970
very quickly so can detect those motions
okay

531
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,140
servo motor sale he also knows when
you're trying to say

532
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,819
block how teachers think right you turn
it like this

533
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:47,910
pulitzer about their handwriting these

534
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,000
replace and turn to get

535
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,869
so we'll actually no okay so if this I
was rotating a certain amount

536
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,000
was impossible for him to do so you know

537
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,279
set up this has to be some sort of robot
and it's actually

538
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:06,710
when I saw this before was kinda
fighters want

539
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,720
oh that's why alike sucks are you

540
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,660
exploit and so what happens is he had
one is on his workplace

541
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,220
course he refused was but every morning

542
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,868
he would go up to it and of course look
at that turned a bit

543
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:25,670
in order to charge because that's how
you know you induce a chartered

544
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,980
which is nice as you're not lying on
batteries up

545
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,150
what happens every day got block our
owners

546
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:38,019
to make it really quick to generate that
charge the problem was

547
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:41,450
every so often shutdown yep week 10
minutes to get in

548
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,419
as the recent this it would

549
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,470
attacked okay this I mean turn way too
much

550
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,240
shut down it also when you turn it you
know to go

551
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,890
27 28 29 and then you can't stop
thinking point

552
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,058
no different action it will go 29-28

553
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:03,559
it'll star completely randomly and will
just be

554
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:06,950
yeah sixth for problem well

555
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,808
law yeah there's lots of other
protections it's basically if that's a

556
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:11,319
flop

557
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:15,049
on whatever your containers block no
longer

558
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:19,519
week yep

559
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:25,109
at the moment track him Obama's

560
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,538
X other fun stuff have for

561
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:34,289
for Tampa resistance is that relevant
all

562
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:38,410
p inside lock with party

563
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,578
as you part lock take

564
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,829
you be all particles

565
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,339
arrest there's ever a problem compares

566
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,489
lock also arms

567
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:56,289
the IC's

568
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:59,309
have temp

569
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:02,640
reached up

570
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,250
K the

571
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:11,220
space X

572
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,379
elsa 07

573
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,529
eights various problems up

574
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:22,680
yep any other questions about

575
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,879
alarms certainly

576
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,339
actually just released what they
consider

577
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,440
but honestly I don't think it's up
carries

578
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,670
the biggest selling point hey it's made
in the USA

579
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,349
yeah in if viewer concern

580
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:42,440
frequent really between

581
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,710
walks and normal rhetoric

582
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,809
I no electronic box

583
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:53,079
3d much stock so I'm working on some
stuff right

584
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:56,349
have fun like most basic and Muslim
store

585
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:00,180
like your your all your your
combinations

586
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,399
like the supervisor nation plain text on
the chip

587
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,430
you have all sorts bike trek last

588
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,930
Mike Taylor yep dial

589
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,960
I'll week

590
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,880
buzzing accent you middle said

591
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,210
I'll back on over one nice thing

592
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:26,549
with blood loggers mechanical

593
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:30,319
always a little bit various so if you
dial

594
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:34,150
the combinations 62 you go 62 and

595
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,799
maybe 63 would still kick Center

596
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:41,799
the same number that you're getting
combination additional saying look

597
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:45,239
62 there is no there's no

598
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:52,239
3x your soup

599
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,000
walks have electronic features

600
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,989
don't dollars

601
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:05,880
the other he's

602
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,309
were military-grade box this once

603
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:13,210
okay this one step now and they work

604
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,500
much like side force week

605
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,130
are struggled go on at least three
millimeter plate steel

606
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,529
sites actually were most commonly used

607
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:30,640
if you going back very sick

608
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,379
we're issues plate on the back

609
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,210
sure dial number

610
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,660
fixed dials all number

611
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,220
to be changed after with the dollar

612
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,399
same for the Packers is side and this
one actually a shiny

613
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,059
since meant to kinda give a little
timbre at

614
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:57,140
behavior so there's a sort of tools that
were made

615
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,390
there's a greater temperature stop

616
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,720
weird

617
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,288
questions walks

618
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:14,519
up like

619
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:21,519
still

620
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:29,730
start

621
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,890
and if you wanna see the how the speed
dial works

622
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,230
I reassemble this onesie as the old

623
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:41,480
up
