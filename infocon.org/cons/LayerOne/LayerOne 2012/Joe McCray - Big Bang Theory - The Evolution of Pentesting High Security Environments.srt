00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,870
but some I'm sorry if you want to learn
anything important

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,899
free to leave like now this is just a
rant

11
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,219

protester

12
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,789
trailer app contest for guy the Black
Eyed security conferences that's me

13
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:50,129
place a guys didn't know batsman's

14
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,530
our guys how do I do what I do i hack

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,730
hikers are Drake the order changes but
the things that I do

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,819
that that's it right so arm this is me

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,570
progress on me take you back I can
recall many many moons ago

18
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,630
a exploiting a whole lotta sole heiress
a whole lotta

19
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,630
up for him HP lack some

20
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,789
the good ol days menaced own all kinds a
shit in

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,040
it did about like this if anybody
remembers remember giving up

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,530
when it was version 1

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,520
so we in my happy actually better grab
my hair you tell that in the port city

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,670
but remember that stuff

25
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,750
anybody remember root shell

26
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,810
in about another packet storm but

27
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,390
what years ago right in a moment when
message was for

28
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,570
height you might remember what snorter
spring-like one open source actually

29
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,509
meant they want to make a profit from it
but no but not another room is a

30
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,970
ok I guess it's just me so after what we
did back then was we just owned

31
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,590
everything

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,820
I mean call we want customers to do is
apply a patch

33
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,789
at least until the customer like it's
free just just apply

34
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,690
remember customers will say stuff to me
like yeah but want to break something

35
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,880
that was the only concern that they have
really no one can about security at the

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,430
time

37
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,610
then we write a report we tell the
customer that the networks Oct

38
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,860
well hasn't changed that much since them

39
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,330
we get paid so what's been testing light
today

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,510
well you have your scope incall you tell
the customer how thorough you're gonna

41
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,989
be wider promise too much not to break
anything

42
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,220
then you run your vulnerability scare
masses expose Qualis

43
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,260
whatever it is the league on Twitter all
bad

44
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,920
million you take your first one
framework Metasploit course a

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,660
whatever me use the same exploits as
well it's okay

46
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:56,950
reads like last week after that we copy
and paste the results from last week's

47
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,548
report

48
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:02,850
been to this report because it's the
same vulnerabilities right weak

49
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,090
passwords

50
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,070
week SSL process crib in SQL injection
is the same stuff right

51
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,100
now we give the customer recommendations
that we absolutely know that they're

52
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,060
never going to implement

53
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,660
yes yes whose dumping testing come back
the very next year only to find the same

54
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,600
boat as president don't like is Justin

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,470
yes yes right in them when we get back
to you

56
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,950
agree dislike we get back on Twitter

57
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,890
we talk about Obama's a loss at them
stuff like that and then we use the

58
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,720
buzzword what's the buzz word

59
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,230
ATT the mental life

60
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,920
that's our life we live a copy paste
scare

61
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,880
wife that that scare disembodied

62
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,250
who like Barbie in a contest will be so
cool a man you find that all you do is

63
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,730
copy

64
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,328
his last week's report talk on Twitter
camera Metasploit

65
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,859
embodied okay I guess about them testers

66
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,280
okay welcome that's the life no

67
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,079
today you have so many security measures
in the network in this world mazes in

68
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,600
a bill that works with have Endpoint
Protection

69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,699
proxies reverse proxies load balancers

70
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:26,910
application date: ways XML gateways of
protecting my parcel as seven box

71
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,389
what they spend more money in defense is
shit them actually spilled

72
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,780
fixing this year in some places anybody
seen this network

73
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,669
right you do spend so much money on this
defense to stop the love the server

74
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:42,750
configured properly

75
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,270
rate so offense as the customer a
princess the customer

76
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,299
im they asked me to

77
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,460
mom test this one summit what s the
summer find some stuff

78
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,130
I go over and talk into one other
customers are working out offense the

79
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,570
MySQL servers that a misconfigured

80
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,430
almost like you really need some updates
on these four servers

81
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,510
there in the DMZ now it's not to the
customer

82
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,770
the lead developer comes over he's like
old all those are dope service

83
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,310
I was like butter the Ember there in the
DMZ

84
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,790

85
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:27,710
product but there in those you know how

86
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,820

the D no I'm startin spilling out D E

90
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,719
a rosy is where the development stuff is

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,020
waiting for him but I don't know how i
met him at that no

93
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,159
immediate easier for them to move cold

94
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,330
from development to production I was
like no shit

95
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,900
the a musha

96

heaviness okay what does what we're
gonna do

100
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,599
gonna talk to the dev team and find out
why they think it's easier to keep this

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,240
stuff

102
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,600
in the production networks would get
over there a.m.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,000
we have to have a meeting with the
deputies before does the CIO you know

gotta chinook and we're going to take

110
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,680
screenshots think

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,900
oh yes sure we'll get you once allegedly
this box

112
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,020
now they can find the password for it
for like a week

113
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,049
but only by a password for box

114
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:07,400
a log into it over tell Matt

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,690
over tell Matt in the DMZ

116
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,890
and I'm like is this part students so
damn long

117
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,430
Larkin we literally like three minutes
to log in

118
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,600
over telnet ember

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,990
mouth but would you like them to the
park someone cheezits

120
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,320
Chris this damn boxes all

121
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,010
so are one check broke in on this
fucking things got five rootkits on the

122
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,530
box

123
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,210
Packers are elbowing each other for but
the room

124
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,229
on the box right so now we have to have
a meeting for the mother meeting to talk

125
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,340
about the next meeting about

126
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,388
this box in addition to the stuff that's
in the

127
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,150
BNZ because this box is also a member

128
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,060
DMZ no talking to a customer bounded

129
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,020
and the customer system in will

130
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,299
did the IDS detect any other who

131
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:15,300
then I said what mall because that is
the IDS

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,080
love this right so this box is the IDS

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,359
was at his home in time this box

134
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,490
is the idea snout they had paid

135
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,389
for managed security service provider

136
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:34,169
the move the security service provider
who's a very large corporation like at

137
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,779
main cause a problem bears some love you
actually worked there

138
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,990
sooo expired four years prior

139
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,870
the customer caps sending them money

140
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,889
but because the isolated expired

141
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:55,630
the MSSP drop management on the box

142
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,769
that kept collecting the church

143
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:03,470
each do more look

144
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,149
I up

145
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,269
so I just the whole point in trying to
say is that company

146
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:18,269
that was own that bad had one of the
highest ratings in regulatory compliance

147
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,050
their secure because

148
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,849
they had network monitoring

149
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,449
check they had

150
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:39,339
intrusion prevention check

151
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:43,449
I can't say what compliance was his gaza
probably gotten customers

152
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,359
them so

153
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,910
the whole point and get an honest people
have all the stuff in the network right

154
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,010
they have call the security mechanisms
it's harder to paint us today because of

155
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,529
all the security mechanisms

156
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,639
Borchard gonna find is that

157
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,930
we need to start focusing on the fact
that the security mechanisms are present

158
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,609
but how well the actually work if at all

159
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,660
and if they are configured at all

160
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,219
and those buzzword APT I like it

161
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,510
I actually like it yes I fear monger

162
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,980
that's me scare the piss outta the
customer damnit yes

163
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,230
tell them be fuckin afraid be very

164
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,350
very afraid the Chinese coming to getcha

165
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,410
be afraid K her regards to close the
summer ATT

166
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,500
are right a beauty for people's better
smarter than you

167
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,410
they have more resources for you and
they're coming for you

168
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,910
good luck with that

169
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,459
my next one when it comes to companies
and governments large military ties

170
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,690
valuable intellectual property alliance
among they generally fall into one of

171
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,260
two categories people

172
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:04,260
what are those categories pleased

173
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,699
so you have to let them know this is
where you are situational report

174
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,490
alright guys when you start looking at
the defensive mechanisms that we have in

175
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,880
place in today's networks

176
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,260
these like Tammy virus that i truly
bypassed with

177
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,240
samples simple txt modification most
people can use Packers an obvious

178
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,800
leaders

179
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,400
trevally bypass any virus uploaded to
buyers total known that'll be good for

180
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
at least a week

181
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,130
before deployment on your network so
that's gonna waste

182
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,740
Bora Billy assessments today

183
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,960
getting into the network does not
necessarily rely

184
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,720
on the president's oval or ability and
this is something I'm a harp on real

185
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,170
hard

186
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,860
didn't House Hospice bar was two factor
authentication

187
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:57,200
email filtering you can lead the slide
it's all too easy if it's easier to

188
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,150
steal it

189
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,840
then it is to reverse engineer are India

190
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,670
decibel gonna do the African still I got
a customer confirmed appt

191
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,910
by the time we got there by the time we
got there the attackers have had domain

192
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,620
admin privileges in the network for over
a year

193
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,790
by the time we got there it's like hey
we're here

194
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,620
arm to talk to the admin's I mean the
the hackers I mean both

195
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,750
you know the guys who run the network
them

196
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,670
right they've not control the network
for so long the attackers were

197
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,030
literally coming here stealing project
points

198
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,420
only even stealing management training
millet still in Six Sigma training

199
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,079
and coming back at the Mex quarterly
updates like they would know hey we got

200
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,760
our stuff

201
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,189
okay the next milestone for the project
is in July

202
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,330
the hackers likely will be back on the
2nd week to check your mouth

203
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,330
seaway all a rapid 18 im

204
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,600
the thing about it is who's doing all
this stuff

205
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,590
miss Lottie body every mother fuckin
bomb if you look at my

206
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,910
got lockheed-martin North government l3
Booz Allen

207
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,110
SAIC jump on the financials why I am out
of city

208
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,210
I'll see you know you look around and
it's everybody

209
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,280
you got law firms getting on because
people are realizing that you know what

210
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,199
if I get into the builder

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,600
well the supplier the target that's
another way for me to get into this

212
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,170
company

213
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,180
so you've got some organizations are
multi-billion dollar organizations they

214
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,160
got the money

215
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,829
to buy useless some products and
offensive stuff but we know doesn't work

216
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,980
but then you've got the smaller
organizations don't have these resources

217
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
and they're getting own

218
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,560
even worse so I'm trying to show you
this because I want you guys to start

219
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,400
change in the way that we look at
security and start using a buzz words to

220
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,370
help you

221
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,080
get more business can bear poet we all
know that a PT is the stupidest fucking

222
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,210
thing in the world with

223
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,000
we all know we're family we can say it
it's still good

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,110
it's still open it is that is what is a
really advanced

225
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,160
come on did you see the RSC email

226
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,980
released that's it thanks :d now

227
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,440
its be enhanced blocked it's proving a
point that when it comes to your

228
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,840
intellectual business property and what
it does

229
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,020
what it is that makes your business work
that has value

230
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,800
that's what I love about repeating
they're still in the stuff that matters

231
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,880
okay so let's look at the organizations
in the previous lives

232
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,470
do they have regularly updated
information assurance programs

233
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,840
all those companies we just listed the
answer is

234
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,800
do they have configuration management
change management programs

235
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,990
do you have a dedicated IT security
budget

236
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,140
do they have dedicated IT security staff

237
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,110
are all those organizations been tested
at least annually

238
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,290
and most importantly our all those
organizations compliant

239
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,010
the answer is yep

240
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,040
yeah yeah so here's something that I've

241
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,339
that's come up really bothering me know
you could say it's my midlife crisis

242
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,510
well feel they've got really providing a
lot about it was a pen tester

243
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,200
anymore iron honestly asleep in my heart

244
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,750
just it's just us and it's not like them
according to put this on you too

245
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,560
I could talk to you guys write honestly
in my heart feel like I'm doing the

246
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,869
customer disservice by contest in a min

247
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,350
what real business value MI giving you

248
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,370
by telling you what the scanner can tell
you

249
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,450
what it only customer care for can read

250
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,650
but all sometimes right

251
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,270
but what real business value doesn't
just enough

252
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,910
you know to just say here's the
vulnerabilities in your environment

253
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,170
gopac's me under tools out there that
can do that for the customer

254
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,160
in a lot of cases actually pass that
perhaps the bottle is for the customer

255
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,300
in a lot of cases cheaper than it would
cost them

256
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,949
to hire me to tell you to punch the shit
that's fucked up in your environment yes

257
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,770
so I'm sayin that guy's

258
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,040
too many people think that ATT is about
whole day in advance the exploits and

259
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,449
all that kind of stuff

260
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,690
all they want is all you got APT

261
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,890
is about somebody who's trying to steal

262
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,110
what it is that makes your business
woman white

263
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,540
that's what has business impact that's
part of your PCP that's part of your Dr

264
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,750
ping that's part of

265
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,320
your risk assessment this is somebody
who is hell-bent

266
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,330
all in stealing your ability

267
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,740
to to do business that's what it's all
about

268
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,280
so dip in testing to us this to
replicate the hacker for

269
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,510
and show all the customer Howell how
resilient they

270
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,430
are to the hacker threat is what we're
doing running scanners

271
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,730
then showing them the vulnerabilities is
that an accurate representation

272
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,089
how the hacker will bring him today

273
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:13,720
no so

274
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,060
if you look at this stuff can you say
are a

275
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,750
what about the new strides that are
going on in contesting my goal oriented

276
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,880
contestant

277
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,910
goal or the protest as one of the things
we use it like a

278
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,050
a flag for a marker and say hey in Egypt
get acts

279
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,639
to prove to me that the gym do this I
need to have one customer say

280
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,220
major tell me how much money my boss
makes another custom missus hey if you

281
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,900
can get to the SWIFT network and show
that you can move money

282
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,630
at six that's another customer this as
well I need to get the two social

283
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,860
security numbers

284
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,979
above the two investors in this bank
with the largest accounts

285
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,300
no but goal-oriented contesting and I
think that's a step in the right

286
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,530
direction

287
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,879
the step in the right direction but
don't think that's where it needs to go

288
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:04,210
if you look at this stuff guys you look
at things like viruses

289
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,890
lapel mic want them alone group

290
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,340
group

291
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:18,340
that video

292
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,560
to the back up

293
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,450
are gone so if you look down on the
bottom left here you see you got viruses

294
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,760
the losses worms

295
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,580
you start to see from minor annoyance
all the way up to the top

296
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,780
right miss you grow a one has the most
significant impact on a business

297
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,180
and it's things like coordinated attacks
targeted malware

298
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,500
these things up the most in part to a
business because they actually still the

299
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,750
business's ability

300
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,680
to do with the business is therefore I
can make money in ruin my employees

301
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,420
lives

302
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,420
that's what businesses build right

303
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,500
%uh don't laugh too you know it's true

304
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,430
what we want to make money at the
expense of the poor schlub soared on the

305
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,550
damn work-related

306
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:10,379
that's business so it when hackers are
fucking with but that's not a good thing

307
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,660
un-american that's why it's Chinese

308
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,360
our dubbed

309
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,000
a I hope this sometimes people to please
don't beat me up with

310
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,780
the book are guys so we've got a boner
Billy Joel

311
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,340
industry right so everybody remember the
whole thread

312
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,120
asset bodily matrix that we all learned
in school

313
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,850
way like hey here's your asset this is
what's important

314
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,230
here's the threat this is the bat hacker
who's gonna break him

315
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,230
and it took only break in because the
president's over what

316
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,180
of our ability so

317
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:53,210
the entire Information Assurance Program
concept is focused on

318
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,620
the removal overall ability from back

319
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:03,040
well if we look at her appt works

320
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,149
is a boner ability required a person's
you

321
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,280
in email or drop a USB key

322
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,639
does there have to be a vulnerability
exploited

323
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,310
to get code execution go ahead

324
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,629
answer I weighed

325
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,750
I is good point clear

326
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,210
so when you look at that a bully isn't
required I don't need a vulnerable

327
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,710
version

328
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,830
other dobie I don't need a vulnerable
person up Internet Explorer

329
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,899
to just get you to click on a link so
this whole program cancer

330
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,930
really been focusing on the removable
bollard release from your environment

331
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,950
gonna say it's a waste of time because
that would be the truth

332
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,850
but what you really want to say is it's
not your focus should be

333
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,360
you have a picture information assurance
program if used

334
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,189
made a dedicated effort to remove
invulnerability shamir environment maybe

335
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,710
it's time to start looking at her

336
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,240
what shoppers actually do

337
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,800
so we start looking at how it BT works
right is generally gonna be some

338
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,960
some targeted open source intelligence
willing to collect information about you

339
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,600
we're gonna figure out what's the most
likely infection back to get them to the

340
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,139
network

341
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,540
then they're gonna pilfer grab all the
stuff in the network to move laterally

342
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,920
lateral movement these are the things
that you want to be able to detect

343
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,320
as their profile and moving laterally
Olympics will trade in there are the

344
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,810
network

345
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,620
these are the things that you want to be
able to detect a specifically because

346
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,540
these things don't change

347
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,430
as rapidly as the exports so on a
typical day if you watch exploded in

348
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,890
your packet storm really the security
web sites

349
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,750
you're somewhere between game 30 and 50
Lee

350
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,410
exploits released per day per day

351
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,340
Mel if you actually look at how a person
moves from computer to computer

352
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,290
isn't changing that rapidly has met you
some PSX that changed

353
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,990
that rapidly in the last fifteen years

354
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,540
right the things that a hacker does
least on a mission

355
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,760
took over the network to move laterally
Olympics will traded other network

356
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,260
doesn't change as rapidly as the exports
do

357
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,910
but all the buzz in the hype is around
the one exports

358
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,960
if that's changing all the time live
every day in patch tomorrow you can have

359
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,800
more vulnerabilities the patch

360
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,800
right but surely customers kill really
detect registry modification

361
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,460
throughout the network service
modification throughout the network

362
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,390
play some more common APT tactic is to
use the wireless discovery service

363
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,490
as the service for actually running
about doris kiddle

364
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,740
because in a corporate environment you
generally don't need wireless discovery

365
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,880
service right there are

366
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,240
you are wired in so it's a great service
to keep enabled

367
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,130
and run your back door under that
service made

368
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,490
make sense these are the types of things
that we

369
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,060
a security consultants and protesters
need to start trying to get our

370
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,360
customers to understand

371
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,100
can you actually the tact malicious
activity

372
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,689
these are the things that hackers do
these are the directories workers like

373
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,840
to hide behind us

374
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,189
can you 10 you detect

375
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,700
home a large data transfer can you
detect

376
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,300
are the same set of credentials being
used across hundreds of machines in your

377
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,909
environment

378
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,330
can detect those things because that
actor activity

379
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,669
when you look at a person's mood across
three four hundred machines today

380
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,550
but the same set of credentials and is
not only a service accounts it's doing

381
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,740
patch management or

382
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,560
configuration management so much people
in a WTF right

383
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,909
I do what the hell is that because if we
have a look at those times are things

384
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,870
that we were monitoring are bound
traffic will be able to detect the stuff

385
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:54,250
right because really met their good but
they're not that damn good

386
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,270
so ABT does not liable liabilities I
love what people are going with

387
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,660
data-driven assessments

388
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,020
I think it's very forward-thinking but I
don't think there's enough focus

389
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,000
on where it needs to go on this is what
I'm talking about it needs to change

390
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,880
it needs to change alright

391
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,610
the security industry is focused on
minimizing the presence of

392
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,770
vulnerabilities

393
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:20,180
what I want to introduce to you as a
concept I call it capability based

394
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,050
security assessment what i think is more
important now

395
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:29,250
is to measure the customers ability to
detect and respond

396
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,650
to malicious activity that's more
important

397
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,930
how well killer customer detect
malicious activity

398
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,110
how quickly do they respond to it the
Patriot domain I'm gonna tell

399
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,679
in your environment how long does it
take you to figure out that that has

400
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,660
happened

401
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,090
if if forty machines in your environment

402
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,260
have new services created how long does
it take for you to figure out that to

403
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,830
happen

404
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,169
their whole or does it take for you to
investigate it those are the types of

405
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,850
things that we want to start asking our
customers

406
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,129
you're gonna find it you're gonna get
some pretty but you're looking at

407
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,220
customers because they're going to be at
work

408
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,520
all them I'll I don't know how long it
will take us to respond to that

409
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,950
that's because they're already old right

410
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,910
it's now been test this incident
response right every case this is the

411
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:21,110
things that I'm finding out

412
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,689
so are broken down into five pieces

413
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,250
so we want to rate the customer in how
well they do

414
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,350
and identifying when these spaces

415
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,409
a happening to them when the attackers
doing this to them can you detect when

416
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,370
someone is doing a target in an
information-gathering

417
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:44,000
a.m. how much of this information do you
have those publicly available

418
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,870
that will be used potentially could be
used against you

419
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,540
initial entry once a person has gotten
into the network via

420
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,080
spearfishing be a USB key or whatever
the case may be

421
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,780
how well can you detected what level of
sophistication

422
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,899
10 you actually detect the next thing
post exploitation

423
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,790
when a person is data mining your
network file system or hospice file

424
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,770
system

425
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,940
you know can you detect the hot and the
lateral movement as people are moving

426
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,440
from computer to computer in your
environment

427
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,110
tell you detect a data exfiltration when
the data is leaving your network

428
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:25,229
can you detect a know what level of
sophistication can you detect

429
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,360
so that's that process

430
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,159
and mel is gonna break it down in some
categories try to keep these really

431
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,380
really simple

432
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,460
right because it you know you know
trying to make the woman's massive

433
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,910
complex rest charts

434
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,770
just trying to get it so that the
customer can try to get a feel for what

435
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,480
they can but then it gets

436
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,120
right everybody anybody at least get a
lot of fights located

437
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,570
nobody you're likely follow a lot worse
there's more people

438
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,320
there's the people right okay if you're
one of those kids who got into a lot of

439
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,210
fights

440
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,720
you lou who you could work big after a
couple hours weapons you middle or back

441
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,240
hip

442
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,730
my mess with him that little kid I'll
I'm talking about today

443
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,980
what's this riot its kinda the same
closer

444
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,470
right you need to know okay the little
ankle biter scripted he was just wanna

445
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,720
scanners wanna Metasploit na lot

446
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,330
all we could handle his a so we we got
back K but that dooms writers all custom

447
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,449
by various right mazone exploits

448
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,790
know how to build my own prolly ago mess
with him the sisters cue

449
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,470
I'm assalam way that's what we're trying
to get here

450
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,790
can we deal with the person who says
those scripting just download stuff from

451
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,820
run stuff

452
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,770
can we deal with the person who are
column got some day I usually call those

453
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,820
is equivalent to assess admits

454
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,450
people were fairly technical know some
windows no salutes no some Cisco

455
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,960
might have a little bit a script in
background but they're not hackers per

456
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,990
se

457
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,030
but Dale to give you an idea of how
technicals person hears

458
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,260
the mixed group will be there organized
crime harder for hire

459
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,150
this is a person who this is this is
pretty much his job is good at this

460
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,500
he writes his own customized by areas he

461
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,460
all rights is on show court if necessary
the gym do the modifications to get past

462
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,230
common security mechanisms is pretty
comfortable with it

463
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,150
tail in your last guys the state
sponsored by these are the guys using

464
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,700
zero-day exploits

465
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,640
using the whole arm their own Trojans
that they've built from scratch your

466
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,570
that's that's kinda the more high level
stuff alright so let's look at the phase

467
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,919
1 the targeting

468
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,150
all the stuff that we find in press
releases on LinkedIn

469
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,870
you know everybody's very familiar with
this using tools like multi-goal

470
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,929
possibly confocal

471
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,630
mostly as a very familiar with this
kinda stuff

472
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,940
nothing but I want you guys to start
looking at is the initial entry

473
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,290
here's some things that I've been using
with customers lately

474
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:55,010
soul your script kiddie stuff all the
way down to

475
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,930
the most its you your most delete stuff
right

476
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,930
came the 10 the customer catch

477
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,210
a client-side exploit that's less than a
year old

478
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,950
client-side exploit you know im us 1103
the botnet bug that works against

479
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,590
Internet Explorer 8

480
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,889
are for Windows 7's a good example about
to test the kids

481
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,930
your father works a lot of the
environments where you think it should

482
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,070
my but hey we're running Windows seven
we should be good

483
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,230
not realizing that they don't have good
updated versions about Matt

484
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,190
response the works 10 vulnerabilities
are less than 90 days or the storm

485
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,650
notice as we go down this chain these
are getting tougher

486
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,850
said getting a customer who can respond
or abilities clients eyeball abilities

487
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,490
that are less than 90 days old

488
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,730
but the customs very prepared don't see
a lot of that out there

489
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,110
now we get down to the next step where
they got their patch management

490
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,820
really under control you really are
going to be able to exploit them

491
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,860
with you know about those less than two
months old but

492
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,110
shame for credentials that's right next
level

493
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,659
10 so which you're dealing with these
first as the mess that we're gonna go to

494
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,230
we're in Spearfish for credentials world
a fake site

495
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,840
and you might even go so far as domain
names

496
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,300
its domain names the places like
Websense Aluko

497
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,980
so for RS then yes we do do this on
going to present

498
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,380
so we buy the domain may be submitted to
it Glidecam

499
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,800
a blue absence would get authorized get
cap

500
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,960
est and you will use my proxy to read to
a real website

501
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,080
the see redirect you to our website you
can

502
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,110
fights with in your it that don't
redirect them

503
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:41,330
it is within your side the podium or
just transfer

504
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,120
the next thing will be to file format
these are

505
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,189
but yes bugs index bugs and

506
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,120
office these types of things you the
stock the most boyhood

507
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,229
after that we move into the best the new

508
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,610
POBox things like to drop members when
you're in

509
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,939
global sales side of the by ActiveX
control

510
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,400
Apple's where the the context up

511
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,540
she's really well numbers you're up
against something like it

512
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,620
ran into this about past where the

513
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,629
was running semantic action

514
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,200
that TMG replacement River

515
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,930
and the bring im of computer chair

516
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,070
and impact use your children the jury

517
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,129
wow them out but we have to my part
before production

518
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,190
we had a bypass I meant for nation
heavenly

519
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:42,380
budget hotel then the networks back to
plug in a pot

520
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,120
by and their is going to be a

521
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,929
the mice export begin next week modifier

522
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,660
bypasses the or find okay

523
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,380
but my pap maybe last month

524
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,010
just a spoiled local stuff me a spare

525
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,690
feel miserable clinton

526
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,130
so what we shot each case get the custom

527
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,690
dammit which 2245 X

528
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,080
prime did work with a wimp

529
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,550
this until you not point of that

530
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,909
a billion for the fathers

531
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,290
the top teacher there said

532
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,590
here since so high you could appears

533
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,889
but it was just or isn't executed

534
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,120
are these looked hot a lot of people

535
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,370
the metal it to do it the things she

536
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,760
what to tell you we ended up what

537
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,800
bill a a

538
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,909
customized butter butter in GW

539
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,080
were they were marked

540
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,220
01 the with my from the

541
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,720
tree mmm amid dementia

542
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,430
not program are did not

543
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,460
word

544
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,480
Baba but his work with on

545
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,520
this summer those that their the same

546
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,560
but I'll manTech temps

547
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,490
on the that the world but not the

548
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,450
itself so those going to be looked inch

549
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:29,380
by they might the RS

550
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,320
but we love this it this process

551
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,169
forward out soon review

552
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:42,100
open it

553
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,929
setback

554
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,800
so but initially of about put

555
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,690
patient suspect bosses or pope

556
00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:00,490
Kenny that stuff so people think

557
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,290
all these handsome balloon attend

558
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,300
at work re a about you

559
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,550
where the inhabit password workers

560
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,860
Sydney weren't you have a local admin
password was george bush

561
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,500
so they have a password spreadsheet that
had all the house was in the network

562
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,989
they're labeled the spreadsheet george
bush

563
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:26,020
so you don't like the spine string
command research inside a miles

564
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,350
so like we're using these Dirk Nannes
research in the filesystem

565
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,440
for files that contain risk and password
im

566
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,080
things like that but you actually start
searching in piles you find a bunch of

567
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,810
stuff

568
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,570
always search for things like risk
assessment investment invoice

569
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,940
things like that remember goal is to
show how we would do

570
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,820
damage to this company or how we will
find information

571
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,160
but could be damaging to the company

572
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,879
okay lateral movement tema customers
attacked you moving files between shares

573
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,880
now they in an environment where they
even allow I'll share

574
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,160
you know for example you trying to
customers not to allow

575
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,200
a PC to PC sharing you really want them
to use in source CMS solution

576
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,819
not share files between PCs one of the
things that I ran into

577
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,960
very recently which was absolute the
hardest thing I ever had a contest

578
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,590
was they actually use IP sack mounting
criticism just the filtering rules

579
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,240
to not allow workstations to community
at all

580
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,379
so if you want to communicate with
something you needed to communicate with

581
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,970
that and the server network

582
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,370
they have local admin account Hall
analyze

583
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,900
the local admin account called analysts
say all these white tables

584
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,560
are the PCs and sell the shares in the
back are the

585
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,850
admin the scenes and then but here's the
server network

586
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,610
the PCs all had a local at Mattel call
analyze

587
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:52,910
the avenues had an Italian they can log
into the PC with an Italian

588
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,850
analyze account was not on the piece on
the Sony Tablet PCs

589
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,830
was not on the server PCs so Spearfish

590
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,240
you got on this network did you
collected

591
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,689
the be a local admin account lets a WC

592
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,830
year any tax or something like that you
can't go anywhere with it

593
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:15,700
your PC communication is not allowed

594
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,960
there's an explicit deny rule that
traffic to match immunity

595
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,410
with the ad network so only trying to
commission a tip from you have a network

596
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,779
was allowed

597
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,870
to come into below workstation network

598
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:33,120
so %um to Spearfish all you want but you
will walk wary Spearfish

599
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,240
and you have to call something in the
server network

600
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,060
to try and get back to the ad network

601
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,460
its sales like it's a pain in the butt
but these are the types of things that

602
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,750
made it very difficult for attackers

603
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,000
come from an administrative standpoint
r1 easier to deploy than you think

604
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,240
now how many would you like to do like
memory analysis using tools like

605
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,850
volatility in stock like that

606
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,600
memorize from like mandiant those times
and tools did you have this type of

607
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,270
environment you can use that local
Italian

608
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:06,400
to log into the machine run your memory
analysis tool like many deer

609
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,500
9064 snatched all the memory does from
that machine

610
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,430
pull back to your analysis machine
because you're using material from the

611
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,580
Arabic network

612
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,830
that these users to my views

613
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,540
okay so you can't do real time memory
analysis

614
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,310
and do your work without having to worry
about the attacker moving laterally and

615
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,470
the environment

616
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,450
kept are at more things on lateral
movement a lot useless things like

617
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,580
Matthews

618
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,640
PS exact MPs exact like functionality

619
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,100
will still going to use the same biggest
yes exactly

620
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:45,140
write their own small the uses native
win API calls to execute that

621
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,390
these are the types of things that are
real sophisticated we're trying to see

622
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,450
if people can detect this kinda stuff

623
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:56,129
take data exfiltration so data
exfiltration we want to rate

624
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,640
what level of complexity and
sophistication they can detect

625
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,770
to move date on the network over any
import

626
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,700
to remove dead I love them moved in on
other network over a city

627
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,770
over DNS over I simply to you do it over
incurred to channels logistically as as

628
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,740
a sage

629
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,359
are using an authenticator proxy as the
attacker have to use some sort of highly

630
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,060
customized protocol

631
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,660
these are things that we won't know till
what terminal network

632
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,060
actually do billions gent and

633
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,940
are you noticing that there's not a
whole lot of focus on 10 you to send us

634
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,890
the latest zero-day

635
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,109
right how relevant is that to the
answers What

636
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:40,299
melt inability to defend the answer is
we will have an industry

637
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,030
right but what we need to do is look at
what hackers do when they come for my

638
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,810
something

639
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:48,549
and see if we can defend against that
stuff and it always comes down to the

640
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,859
things that we hate to say but due to go
to eat your vegetables

641
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:55,230
dude no clear text because in the
network ultimately

642
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,530
anything is leaving the network you
can't tell me that this shit you

643
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,420
remember

644
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,120
right but its even your vegetables im
what our customers like our customers

645
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,660
like buzzwords

646
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,089
like to spend money on bus works like
shit champ

647
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,450
right you gonna eat your vegetables

648
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,029
alright so do you see things like

649
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:21,000
rar files in cryptography files DC rar
files on shares

650
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,250
in Deraa least am for that kinda stuff
do you look for that

651
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,990
the regular look for rogue access points
do you have GPS

652
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,950
those that don't allow the use of USB
cheese you know are you looking for the

653
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,439
types of things that attackers are going
to use

654
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,840
more so than tested for the presence of
all abilities

655
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,880
today now this is some kinda stuff that
you might have to do that some real

656
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,330
crazy man just %uh

657
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,330
where you own something in the server
network bounced through

658
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,029
the and network to get to and David Rd
beals workstation and the router stuff

659
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,820
back through

660
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,950
but generally after on the I've never
had to do all this crazy

661
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,850
where gorham you know from network to
network to get data out a bit

662
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,589
maybe maybe twice a year

663
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,780
we literally made it two times in a year
that I have to do something back complex

664
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,100
most networks loss networks like to find
a

665
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,200
a person who's got 0 meanwhile a real
one writeable share

666
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,750
I grab all the data around the network
are up and that person sharing and

667
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,030
starches copy in on the network

668
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,400
over politics protocols down they'll do
anything about it

669
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,700
will you minutes are looking at ATT
tactics this is what ATT is actually

670
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,310
doing to

671
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,660
so what about places where you hide
stuff bill so for example the system

672
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,029
recycler folder

673
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,270
or the system drive system volume hidden
directories

674
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,400
said us is the only Tasks folder you
know

675
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,480
do you have things that test your
filesystem

676
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,790
for the president's up files in these
directories

677
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,140
is well known directors were people hi
malicious activity

678
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,370
you know are you looking for that
stopping it was there

679
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,819
how long will it take before we
recognize that

680
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,670
to our egos works

681
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,790
alright today's information assurance
programs

682
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:18,279
comprised I'll vulnerability management
cash management

683
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,930
end-user awareness training and then
what was the third thing

684
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:29,640
that's it that is in Information
Assurance Program we have had very sweet

685
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,160
we tell our users what not to click on
every document

686
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,220
batted if you really think about it

687
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,020
you're trying to defend against threat

688
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,140
that's what we years

689
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,060
you know display prices threat report

690
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,070
did you read the Cisco threat reports in
all this

691
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,480
you have documented proof

692
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,070
that this is my hack it works so this
information program

693
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:05,660
concept Information Assurance Program
concept is flawed

694
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,629
you're trying to defend against an
attack from the 90's

695
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,780
I think about it but you trying to
defend against other people just don't

696
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,940
act this way anymore

697
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,140
why aren't we a security consultant
shrine to let the customer know

698
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,350
that this is dead this is dead

699
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,339
you have no fucking prayer defending
your network at this is all you do

700
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,560
you demise much to do given up

701
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,200
good well you might as well

702
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,589
I don't just you know ask him a kiss
your personal

703
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:43,100
tell me we respect where it up but you
might as well

704
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,180
you have no chance right DAX actually

705
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,799
right and them seriously I start
thinking about that and still in the

706
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,530
customer

707
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,440
well you have 5,000 highs in 1600
mediums and

708
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,500
30,000 lows start telling the customer

709
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,270
what level of sophistication they can
actually have been against

710
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,380
a attacker up XYZ skill set XYZ
sophistication

711
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,210
this is what he would probably be able
to do this is what you could

712
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:15,150
tree competently defend against and it
did you start telling people back

713
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:19,000
you actually give them more value
because the

714
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,240
all we do is give them a mess as report

715
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,399
why do they mean us

716
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,530
seriously what is the value we bring it
all we are scared to report

717
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:34,760
and some you know click button
Metasploit right

718
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,950
to me this is the stuff that i think is
really important in this is why I'm

719
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,910
saying that contest

720
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,330
needs to change we have to start showing

721
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,490
real value otherwise how many have you

722
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,479
remember been able to charge crazy races
were contested

723
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,490
I'm not kidding I can remember one
contestant was very important a week

724
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,680
I'm seeing people bidding on projects
right now three grand a week for

725
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,950
penthouse

726
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:04,180
nogales if all it is is

727
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,330
start my scanner click export click
exploit

728
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:13,270
what's going to happen to the price of
Manchester

729
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,500
what's going to happen to the salaries
of security consultants

730
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,030
and security people guess what
secretaries are going to be doing

731
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,940
reich you have to add value

732
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,720
you cutie specter customer to pay you
real money

733
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,080
did you give him bullshit right

734
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,319
you pay peanuts you get monkeys right
now

735
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,910
we have a whole lotta peanuts going out
there are malls to the environment

736
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:41,980
when it comes to testers is what skater
margins

737
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,560
it is our fault article we have to start
making a change and yeah it was what

738
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,700
sets American public ownership

739
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,740
but you can listen to me where so really
don't wanna listen to mere

740
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:58,500
but okay what about Brett Molina risk
assessment I still do a lot of threat

741
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,130
modeling

742
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,260
I still do a lot a risk assessment I'm a
big believer

743
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,440
and things like strive brings things
like dread

744
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,200
to Aus their active I some 27,000

745
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,569
I really do like what's going on with
risk assessments

746
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,160
I'm not saying that they don't have
value I'm not saying don't do them

747
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,120
but I am saying when you him testing you
need to realize

748
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,740
that a contest is a snapshot in time
focus completely on for the presence of

749
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,910
vulnerabilities

750
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:32,399
but that's not what today's Brett is

751
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,790
okay you got things like attackers
enterprise modeling

752
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,359
assets enterprise modeling software
Center truck model you got some really

753
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,509
cool things

754
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,200
but most the Bistro not only matresses

755
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,339
focus I'm asset times for times
vulnerability

756
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,910
people's risk that's the basic concept
you can book from anyone up on

757
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,700
but they all horribly assets threats and
vulnerabilities

758
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,290
four dollar-billion is not necessarily
require what does that do to your risk

759
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,680
rating

760
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,049
its do is not useless right

761
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:09,260
so again I'm not saying to you real up
through modeling but I do want you to

762
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,960
think about remodeling risk assessments

763
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,590
for their proper place not contesting

764
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,750
pen testing needs to be about
replicating the attack or threat

765
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,060
so we need to start doing analysis
things like open I'll see that many

766
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,810
others doing that's good

767
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:29,140
that's good for the industry we need to
share data about hackers and what

768
