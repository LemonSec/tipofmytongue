1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,800
so the stock is basically

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,700
homes on your our to talk about embedded
security within

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,379
proper distributions on

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,310
it's not any sermons your own name
Thursday is the mountains

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,909
here but I'm I do want to talk about
worked with pewter

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,300
embedded system Parma laws that iPhone

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,740
just perspective then you know this is
move early fifteen years later they're

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,800
still finding stuff

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
that was fixed you know back in the
1990s

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,250
late 1990s son David Brian

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,550
consultant with trust was better labs

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,890
I'm it also depends as team have lots of
fun with that

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,930
you the president a hackerspace of
Minneapolis

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,930
we've got an 8500 square foot space with

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,090
all sorts of fun toys metal shop

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,070
which shop eccentric satcher actually
teach the welding class out there as

17
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:04,548
well

18
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,570
have a lot of fun with that and i would
be doing a

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,580
meadow camp at torque am

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,760
so you guys coming to our camp maybe a

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,860
come in world stuff and electronics
hacking

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,170
all sorts of fun stuff are

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,920
so embedded systems and security so

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,420
what's the deal why why embedded system

25
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,040
why would you use an embedded system are
we not awake

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,299
him she

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,659
raid cheap secure well I really scared
but she'd

28
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:48,689
praying and really because it's a little
devices and it's a tiny device that does

29
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:49,429
all the work

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,090
waiting to do braid I got here a router
station pro

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,159
to open source invented router however

32
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,619
all the same principles apply to a lot
of other devices that are out I am

33
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,829
are in the market has a

34
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,340
very small memory footprint usually only
ready n

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,660
16 264 makes a memory this guy's a 128
makes me every which is quite a bit

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,379
home usually storage is limited to 48

37
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,780
16 32 megs somewhere in there the

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,790
also running on like we said low-cost
hardware

39
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,140
so low-cost hardware means you know the
chips are maybe thirty dollars for the

40
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,450
though the device instead you know
eighty do it

41
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:38,470
couple hundred dollars depending on
where you're you're buying little to no

42
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,459
disk storage

43
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,500
so when I say that what I'm talking
about is that

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,200
they're not they don't have a file
system the right to actively 1b has a

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,920
lotta

46
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,399
older memory file systems would crap
about after so many thousand rate cycles

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,590
you know there's gays your footing on
and off so

48
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,080
instead of having lots and lots of space
they

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,670
day basically went for reduced cost

50
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,609
which means that you know those original
file systems as many filesystems

51
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,260
or store systems will very expensive
sorry

52
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,049
well is that a and building a system
with 128

53
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,409
gigs as space will do 48

54
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,780
16 mags and the developer tools

55
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,430
her favorite singers but the developer
tools typically don't include anything

56
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,480
about security

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,280
then be like that picture

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
you know the pictures the well

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
it someone starting a barbecue actually
enter hackerspace

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,590
so the idea here is he's not carry he
doesn't care about what

61
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,810
safety brain it's just you want to get
it going

62
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:52,810
get it get it but up so they can girls
to meet aren't you remember the 1990s

63
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,470
vaguely for some of us

64
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,909
I remember the nineteen eighties I am

65
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,700
you know ninety name he 394 is when

66
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,179
latex Slackware point 99 colonel was
released

67
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,280
and embedded hardware

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,909
was kinda coming around but not really
more so

69
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:19,209
overlooking as the software in the
distribution how the software was

70
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,340
was put together it is then

71
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,940
essentially listed from that small code
base

72
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,520
and now putting these embedded devices
they say that because

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,669
a lot of them are based on busybox so
busy boxes

74
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,090
a great content but it doesn't really
have the security built into it

75
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,119
there's no shadow file by default on a
lot of the distributions that are out

76
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,540
there

77
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,710
rate so that's why I say nineteen
nineties this is like

78
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,299
in the nineteen nineties when you got a
system you know you you had to disable

79
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,180
services to system hardening

80
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,550
they many remember you know China India
com

81
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,160
immediate you had to go and it actually
turned all things off because it sucked

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,110
for security ON

83
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,870
by default there's one user and that's
the only user the

84
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,060
use which is right because why would you
ever have more than one user

85
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,030
ray what's what's the problem with
running is right

86
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,119
%um you can do anything trade

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,160
me there's no controls no restrictions

88
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,840
RM so Jaytech I mean people here her
gtech

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,448
cue excellent Jaytech is our friend it's
pretty cool

90
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:38,150
I was in circuit debugging allows you to
read them

91
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,210
the flash firmware was it really comes
as the membrane

92
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,669
memory registers I you can

93
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,120
hope the machine reset a machine and
that but although using

94
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,960
for the team did has been used in past
is called open it was GD

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,620
which is open on-chip debugger to you
can essentially

96
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,650
tell the CPU hey enter this debate mode
and then show me your memory

97
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,669
show me the money anyway

98
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,169
day take care this is the g8 a header on
on this board right here

99
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,990
though I'm protestation pro it's kinda
hard to see but in bed

100
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,990
at least gives you an idea that's a
14-10 Jaytech better

101
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,330
and here's a any a Netgear proceed

102
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,448
for all blah blah blah blah it's got a
g8 a hater

103
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:31,539
that's pretty cool I could think up some
things we may be able to do with that

104
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:35,360
maybe lower on OS

105
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,470
right so many people heard about a pro
excellent

106
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,360
so I froze pretty cool it's a nice tool

107
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,419
positive pull up by area and then it
just walks through

108
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,330
you know all the same windows okay
here's this here's this here's this

109
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,609
I'm there's also proximity view that
they've I

110
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,990
nothing just include it but that was
what actually help me very quickly

111
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:05,560
about what was going on in the code that
I was looking at

112
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,580
alright so and his men systems where its
security go

113
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,020
there's no sewers rate how many people
here you see you

114
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,039
I think every everybody should raise
their hand I hope

115
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,068
if you don't i mean the rain is right
which is bad

116
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,539
there's no shadow with the shadow filed
you

117
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:29,009
encrypting passwords are hashed
passwords rate

118
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:36,009
arm absolutely why do I care about that

119
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,639
because only root can see it absolutely
yes

120
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,030
you know one typical users that are
coming on your system to be able to see

121
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,479
that

122
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,508
that password for the hash and we have
been donated a bargain

123
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,710
excellent a frock a dollar bill brock

124
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,948
alright so again you know when you to
rule them all

125
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,460
'em a lot of these systems will have an
SNMP

126
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,000
talent SSH and other services enabled

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,460
something that is is appropriate because
it's its record for functionality

128
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,580
but I love it why do I need to run it
S&M hearing device

129
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,878
that's gonna be seen on a customer's
network

130
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,790
break

131
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,060
so it is using a device to read to
restrict network access

132
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,230
but not to the network so

133
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,470
it it's kinda kinda JT

134
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,540
because if the device gets compromised
now

135
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,049
you can't disable the controls on the
device and get access to other

136
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:41,729
components

137
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,220
up the network that are part of the
management network that make sense

138
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,080
p and again I'm

139
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,600
and harmony busybox you know it's it's a
good thing for what it does but

140
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I think we need to probably potentially
improve this so this particular box

141
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,270
and its it's actually supposed to go on
a client's network

142
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,980
had S&P SSH telnet

143
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,840
ON a web service well at school so S&P

144
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,280
yes and he wasn't

145
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,569
was available have public string Devo
public string

146
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,310
like oh hey look I can see all that he
dresses I can see the kernel firmware

147
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,010
version

148
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,830
you know so it's a little useful things
so it

149
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,070
now I know what to target when I'm I
actually wanna go back packet

150
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,690
message was an able make sense

151
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,340
I'll over later on it I found out that

152
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,350
you know it's only the rich user that
enable that they're using a password

153
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,240
not not exactly cool in

154
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,730
on some other versions you can actually
be able to tell that iron

155
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,390
I think too much just go away white why
take the space on disk

156
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,670
just go away and the web server so the
web server is where the

157
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,339
the user goes in enters in stock rate
enters India

158
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,640
data cable set this device update to
building figure or

159
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,930
oren installer attack has to be able to
configure makes sense right

160
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:18,239
alright so what can I do to pawn

161
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,950
they may recognize this picture this is
a

162
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,660
did notices

163
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,770
this is a guy at worker am turhan

164
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,910
was it two years ago for the tamper
evident contest their box went drinking

165
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,760
with them

166
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,370
so

167
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,440
if you could only add an account this
device rate well

168
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,000
so let's figure out how we can do that
you know yet everything is working with

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,340
pink

170
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,130
the it the gateways I he's so the S&P

171
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,370
I can't figure out what networks were
behind in Figure dollars management

172
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:54,920
network

173
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,849
that sits behind this as well as the IP
that I'm assigned any IP that

174
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,040
that this device is a sin so there's
multiple networks that I get pretty into

175
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
because the S&P

176
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
maybe I could use that too

177
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,990
to take and potentially compromise other
machines I did find that other machines

178
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,590
were was you know those IP's

179
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,690
and I get to their asses porn and that's
not cool

180
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,740
great if this is supposed to be a device
that on customer's network

181
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,750
I could crash the thing

182
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,580
rate maybe potential ideally I want to
get a ratio

183
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,360
right ratio would allow me to use
getting the device

184
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,310
compromise the device see what access it
has and then go from there is a

185
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:44,030
as a happening far point alright so some
options for shells

186
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,819
is couple different ways we can go about
this option 1

187
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,430
I can has passwords please rate password
hashes

188
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,699
option to invest your own copy reno
sorry

189
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,780
STR copy day we noticed your copy is to
you if you don't see programming

190
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,510
STR obvious turn company are a couple
years ago

191
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,520
play maybe even more than a couple years
ago there is a basic a project going on

192
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,720
in OpenBSD

193
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,480
to go through her place in East Room STR
copies with stil copies so you have a

194
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,580
blank bounced check

195
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,440
when you actually go to copying string
because what happens if you don't have a

196
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,420
link but check

197
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,819
you can all right that string buffer
overflow

198
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,950
3 arts option 1

199
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,250
dump the firmware interview OJ tank or

200
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,870
if you have the billion IJ rain find the
partitions

201
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,410
been walk excited X don't any of those

202
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,689
then looks kinda nice because it goes
through and find the headers doesn't

203
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,180
always work for everything

204
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,859
but that that works pretty well what you
don't wear the headers re-encode

205
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,460
get and bring to DT and basically ripped
to pieces out

206
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,920
when he ripped his out about the
filesystems

207
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,849
you grab the password hashes crack
passwords be a

208
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,750
Johns River rate possible attack grade
totally possible

209
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,860
alright so

210
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:17,790
STR happy even state agrarian

211
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,819
no too bad are so dump the firmware

212
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,170
again great get for were here via
Jaytech

213
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,680
or via the binary image ideally

214
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,790
then about I'm going to that later but

215
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,680
%um many find more important positions
find the

216
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,849
web interface by Harry's rate existing
as

217
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,750
a as a web server and reverse engineer

218
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,140
and identify strain happy in memory
allocations

219
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,680
crayon

220
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,079
once you've got those at

221
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,720
essentially what I did as I wanna grab
Metasploit now because

222
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,800
and that's what's good Katie but because
it had a

223
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,530
ruby script that somebody already
created to push data under a stack

224
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,870
so I grabbed it grab to an arm by a ring

225
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,720
in this case and then use that our bank
buying

226
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,130
any pussy plus POS data or you know
compile data on that happen

227
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,910
that make sense as possible attack

228
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,780
K alright

229
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:32,780
with your quick demo stop when

230
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,320
so here is that here's what happens when
you rent been walk

231
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,790
I heard you can see this but essentially

232
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,800
we've got there's well

233
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,329
there's a couple different tools here a

234
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,770
firmer might get allows you to take
opened up the RT

235
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,439
firmware put down modified kernel
attended

236
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,320
repackaging and pushing back up to the
device sometimes you can break a router

237
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,980
doing this

238
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,150
sometimes you can't I am button

239
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:40,870
basically what is using has been walk on

240
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:47,870
in

241
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,090
was it was actually get anything but
essentially yeah you go so you can see

242
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,210
Ozma so that's a squash filesystem so
you could take

243
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,390
DD tell DD count

244
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,819
a 30 start at this point

245
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,320
skin to whatever doesn't 324

246
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,610
count for whatever hex 144 is converted
us more just pasted into

247
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,980
2d essentially a with that portion the
image out

248
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,470
because what they what they're doing is
they're packing all these images

249
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,210
all these file systems on top of each
other then it looks like we have

250
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,750
later on we have a visa to filesystem

251
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,600
or some sort of filesystem was on top
that maybe you know

252
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,560
ext3 mids GFS something along those

253
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,209
those lines same follows out piecemeal
lose out

254
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,990
any about them using loophole to
filesystem

255
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,270
the chemical you know

256
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:08,069
pretty easy to do greasy stuff so this
is

257
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,790
open OCD which is connected to you

258
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,920
this little flyswatter device is what
it's called place order to

259
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,920
to GaTech device energy take
interrogator device

260
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,650
already gotta be configured it comes up

261
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,920
basically a power and system here

262
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,790
like that in is your problem

263
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:39,250
in on

264
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,600
it mister

265
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,260
year ago

266
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,330
so I got always fun man sry the ground
system

267
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,780
most McMurray halt the system which is
fine

268
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,360
but NC European

269
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:07,360
0 in

270
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,969
there goes so basically what I did there
is

271
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,580
is when you first plug the device and
got the GaTech unit on it

272
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,389
it doesn't bring tips go tell it send
the command to reset the system

273
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:25,460
and now reset system and now the system
is booting in

274
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,980
and this is you know requisition Pro is
open to the RT is pretty

275
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,780
pretty simple in

276
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,370
do to you alright so that Britain

277
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,949
I'm now I have to do in order to dump
memory

278
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,000
look at the registers is hope system why
would that be

279
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,880
get everything in place other is going
to change

280
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,820
raid so issue the whole command

281
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,280
takes moment and its gonna basically hot
CPU for I think it's five seconds

282
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,120
knowing don't the registers

283
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,330
trade don't the registers there's also a

284
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,230
thing called up image delighted

285
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,460
basically say go from this point memory
to this point memory and double the

286
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,150
memory to

287
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,580
filesystem profile after 5 seconds

288
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,939
actually release the halt in this case
it's rebooting

289
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,400
on if you say resume if I remember
correctly it should actually resume

290
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,060
where you're at

291
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,960
in the breakpoint alright now

292
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,960
guide a pro

293
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:46,899
the scanner monthly let's open

294
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:51,570
they may use medicine before in

295
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,210
Yes No to national program so here it is

296
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,580
in all its binary glory you know
assembly language

297
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,110
but here it is in the the the preview

298
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,860
that allows you to basically go through
and go so here's the main

299
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,590
main function great made his way start
out all your C code

300
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,899
and then here's where it leaks and all
the other stuff that's here

301
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:20,268
you know the sun's kinda large to look
at

302
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:27,269
as you can see and it goes pretty in

303
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,000
I think a better one to look at is CC
search basically tool it goes through

304
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,030
lecture credit cards

305
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,210
on file systems be it's pretty simple

306
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,320
in

307
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,310
but go back to the search this this view

308
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,120
you can see there's the sort of luxury
for how it works starred

309
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,899
is a some 13 years and in process his
asunder and he never served 13

310
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,140
everyone we can look for I'll look
there's going to be

311
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,980
order for you to use that raid factors
malek

312
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,180
further down you im some served memory
allocations happening in their

313
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,400
going investigate that further okay what
happens if I

314
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,440
I get to the point where I could
overflow stack on that particular memory

315
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,620
allocation

316
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:24,070
so yes so that means it's a cool tool

317
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,629
raid but I'm not here so little that's
not what I do

318
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,140
told RN

319
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,240
that worked pretty well anybody have any
questions about that stone

320
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,240
no in

321
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:55,580
yeah

322
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,460
so question is what certain things can
get into with the

323
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,300
fly swatter devices it's pretty much I
am what's the cables that come with it

324
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,870
have

325
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,830
an arm 14 an arm 2010 i think is a TI
did

326
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,830
in churches as well mean anything that
has

327
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,840
G take on it you should be aware outtie
get into it

328
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,470
now finding out that frequency in the
clock cycles may be a little bit more

329
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,240
difficult

330
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,860
the pp

331
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,419
you know the chick that I was working
with was RT on

332
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,630
kill him home column calcium i think is
better

333
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,170
pronounce anyway that chip was a little
bit harder

334
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,670
find documents about because it's
basically you know they're they're

335
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,870
looking at selling it to everybody's
gonna make embedded system

336
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,169
this is a lot easier this is on the
internet this is why I

337
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,800
I went with this cuz I wanted to show
off that there are tools out there that

338
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,030
do it do this

339
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,690
just has to be documented so and that
there are those chipsets are very well

340
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:59,690
documented that attending here for CPU
alright

341
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,140
so I basically gramm this binary

342
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,430
this by air blobs this is

343
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:16,530
you know a router that was going to
claim point mounted

344
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:21,090
the Olympic filesystem grab the password
out other

345
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,350
actually out at the password because
there's no shadows remember

346
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,840
rating I then brought it to John River

347
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,750
and it looks like in three seconds to
seal the cracked so

348
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,090
that was kinda

349
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,600
fail and this password is gonna be
deployed to all the endpoints

350
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,000
great Butler cool so

351
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
that was a over and when

352
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,630
alright susteren County this little bit
more interesting i mean that's like

353
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,140
easy to do any sorry from the bottom ok
Odem

354
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,690
on the web service spray or 12

355
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,000
and and then we used misplayed

356
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,470
with the links a supply CGI are RB

357
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,650
because basically also doing is during
data I don't really care

358
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,330
I was like you know limited in time that
I had to do my testing

359
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,049
I was on site for only couple days at
getting

360
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:26,650
DNA testing get out provide results and
so

361
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,090
grab this there's actually a
blacksmith's review

362
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,610
shoko that's other Internet grabbed it

363
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,490
compiling through into the the
interpreter and

364
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:44,490
into the Metasploit module then I
grabbed poston

365
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,629
and you can see this is basically that
the binary I analyzed

366
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,700
I'm I sanitize it quite a bit but you
can see the string happy

367
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,230
you can see there's a memory allocation
matter if you can see that back there

368
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,690
but

369
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,940
there is there is a string have been a
memory allocation within a certain

370
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,730
component

371
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:09,730
up this web application so and this is
the response this is actually a

372
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,150
I think packet capture so I don't
capture

373
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,880
well I had noticeably module cuz I
really getting

374
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,010
want rate output handlers just like well
its

375
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:26,260
let's do this captured packets move on
on

376
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,760
basically the last and that garbage is
the review

377
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,960
its binary been pushed across and then

378
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,970
what pops back a look do you live see
detected

379
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,220
memory allocation corruption so
basically overflow the stack

380
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,910
followed by this was a back to recent
memory map a

381
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,130
everything that was on system I am using
that

382
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,660
eicher definitely created something
create a shell payload

383
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,179
that would have spotted the machine and
basically compromise this machine

384
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,050
because they had and done their due
diligence

385
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:07,050
in limiting stream links to make sense

386
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,860
I don't mention option three but there's
another one

387
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,540
just modified OJ take image repack in

388
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,830
am flash it with the GaTech reader rate
for the Jaytech

389
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,830
tool it's very very very very slow

390
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,070
to use the J texdem firmware to to load
firmware however

391
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,260
a it's a lot faster did to go through
this process

392
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,960
and and reverse engineer what's out
there and use that to gain access to

393
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,380
disturb actually use the

394
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,130
Jaytech have is from it from a time
perspective

395
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,330
so to give an example I'm when I got
inside

396
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,460
I didn't have a g8 a greater with me on

397
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,800
I basically said okay so here's the
threat vectors rate

398
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,090
this is what we can do I'm in a skilled
attacker

399
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,360
I haven't on a time we can potentially
job done the GA Tech Talk don't for more

400
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,290
of the GA Tech

401
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,770
or via the Digitech so bro to engineer

402
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:17,470
and Saturday don't this force and 24
hours later is like cats not quite done

403
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,120
I come back another couple hours later

404
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,679
I it's done but it's kinda corrupt so

405
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,080
when from my perspective it was very
painful

406
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,360
ties that are in giving and getting a
raw binary will go through and analyze

407
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,320
the rabbi Ari pretending

408
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,570
Lake we you know had several weeks to
actually don't

409
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,270
for more on this and that's how I got

410
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,050
to all these other components are these
other areas that especially able to

411
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,139
recover the hash

412
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:54,140
be able to identify entry point in their
web service is

413
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,130
this fun anybody else this is fun to me

414
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't mean it seem like it but it's
lame exciting

415
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,070
on alright so what we do better

416
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:13,879
on disabled services

417
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,790
great if you don't need SMP shouldn't
running

418
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,940
you don't need to tell me action right
in

419
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,990
putting access control us think that's
the number one

420
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:31,990
bike super easy kinda kind of implement
a seniors with separate accounts

421
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,629
privilege separation great seen its 80
here's our maintenance account

422
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,190
he has access to this function 00 here's
our

423
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,190
you know user gonna check in a check to
see if the user is

424
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,250
actually stupid or the modem is right
great see maybe have a tech

425
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,020
and its restrictions you have all these
other different accounts that have

426
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,770
privilege to

427
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,980
separation and logging in auditing you
to see

428
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,230
in the the large server environment why
can't we do here

429
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,800
minute it doesn't have to be complex you
naval says locking you don't want

430
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,620
anything overtly

431
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,929
gay

432
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,300
also shut off I'll I think you know

433
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,360
I mean if your data Server users you
definitely have to shower file so that

434
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,790
you don't

435
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,909
you can recover the passwords from from
those other users or better yet don't

436
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,340
use passwords use

437
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,770
SSH keys pick this is probably a better
idea in my opinion

438
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:28,260
you have a public key that you just put
all those boxes or maybe you generate

439
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,700
key pairs for all the different boxes
that are out there

440
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,770
you know there was public keys I I don't
really care

441
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,960
just don't use a password because now
want to get access to that box

442
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,820
I get access to the password which means
that goatee other devices on the same

443
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,600
network

444
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,909
and managed and you know compromise that

445
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:49,690
so

446
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,620
what we do better cover you break

447
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,389
notoriety code reviews it

448
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,720
I mean meant I'll be done shortly

449
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,950
you know go to lunch go to you so

450
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,080
good essentially mean the

451
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,340
in

452
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,360
that this instance will where we had
code review

453
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,699
done a service they knew about what I
did explode so

454
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,830
I mean it's it's good that they did code
review but

455
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,669
it's also another integral part is
Exynos box before they go into

456
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,760
production

457
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,360
also don't put debug symbols in your

458
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,500
c plus plus code for production because
that made it so much easier for me to

459
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,390
follow things

460
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,960
I also assume that the system is all
want

461
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,290
Senate whatever you deploy out to the
user's network

462
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,139
is compromised so if I can recover
what's on there

463
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,470
that means that anybody else can well
within reason

464
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,790
but it means that you have to sing
devices home

465
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,930
if you go under that model the security
controls are to be a lot stronger

466
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,320
then if you see him you manage it on the
device you know you

467
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,689
do managing on the device but you don't
want to be compromised

468
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,650
your your your network infrastructure
other devices to be compromised

469
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:16,450
if one system fails

470
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,709
so I think really it if they had done a
security review

471
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:24,029
love the of firmware

472
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:27,379
welcome basically did embedded Linux
distro that they're using

473
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:30,149
they might have gone well maybe we
should use a different when

474
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:31,218
ex-distribution

475
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:34,739
they wish you something that doesn't use
busybox are the box

476
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:37,739
it was put in actual distribution on
here

477
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:44,549
was a real security controls in place
did

478
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:49,179
don't you share passwords for clients
rate each pass rush either be

479
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:52,519
individually generated for all those
devices that are going out there or

480
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,799
should not have a password

481
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,649
should use essentially a siege keys to
walk into the device

482
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:04,649
area done again

483
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:08,539
hardware that the hands of the user's is
out of control

484
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:12,289
and as far as i'm concerned. unless you
really paranoid and

485
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:16,200
you know you have a CPU dedicated for
security

486
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,570
a nigga

487
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:26,599
any possible to controls make things
worse

488
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,899
security in mind I think a lot of times

489
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:34,988
it still happens people develop stuff
until a point where it's

490
00:32:34,989 --> 00:32:38,799
ready to go to production and I go oh
yeah I was checked this curious

491
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,029
no I don't know that is never gonna stop

492
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:45,419
but it it it got better

493
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:50,999
but I still seein all the time you know
that the security should be

494
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:55,109
in the front end development component
hey okay we got a value that we're

495
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:58,458
were taking in you know owners impose
pressure plus programs

496
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:03,339
how we're going to limit that streaming
are we don't want that streamlines is

497
00:33:03,339 --> 00:33:04,320
the developer gonna go

498
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,379
oh yeah we should USTR Okabe instead of
STR Coby

499
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:11,859
and

500
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:15,139
as the last statement ditch busybox

501
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:18,779
by soldiers run real OS is on these
things because they're

502
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,239
there's fast enough and they have the
disk space

503
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:27,359
and power to be able to do that there's
no necessity for being able to

504
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:34,359
her not be able to run for losses on it
anymore in

505
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:38,889
RN i'ma ahead a time

506
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:42,668
think arm so his next all the stuff that

507
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:47,070
I talked about and I found very useful
arm

508
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,158
to explain stevie is where the

509
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,619
arm overflowed Korea's former market
that's the one that allows you to

510
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:56,899
download an open door BRT firmware image

511
00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:00,748
unpack it into directories and then
repack it later on

512
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:04,539
and reverse-engineering

513
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:07,929
is a blog post that talks about reverse
engineering a Lexus

514
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,950
router similar concept am

515
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,520
put up a blog post in the next couple
weeks on this

516
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,918
so it hopefully we'll have little bit
more info

517
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,319
on there as well as as far as what I can
release the hard part is

518
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:26,159
when you're putting together a
presentation you've got all the

519
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,929
screenshots and you like and there's way
too much data in that

520
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,569
i cant became show that so world

521
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:39,569
will be another their people village
that the slide for these people are

522
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,989
trying to take a picture

523
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:45,368
in ankles if you have any questions

524
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:49,290
in

525
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:53,800
you

526
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,139
me

527
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,910
yes yes well I debug symbols and his
girl out uprooted

528
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,549
to have a better outlook on what the
code is doing

529
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,730
grade so it it may be easier for me to
go through ago re:

530
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:14,730
there's where I see this this is where I
see this also meant but this was just

531
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,180
too

532
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,609
Co that I was running committees is
actually pass for guessing tool

533
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,510
yeah know that December's I

534
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,530
bro I'm I'm sure there's other
december's out there

535
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:36,530
this lines

536
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,540
okay online leaders

537
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,609
strike him

538
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:52,779
and running missus mean he won

539
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,090
so

540
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,420
was that my sims the right in its sole
million

541
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,280
run 80

542
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,380
your Virgin party believe

543
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,150
ignited jeanine

544
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,250
no my my approach so my purse was
entirely grabbing

545
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,730
grameen firmware the binary trade binary
image

546
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,810
mountains that up numbers and hearing it
brain

547
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,960
DJ tagged ways

548
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,300
if I had enough time this is where we go
great

549
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,210
again at a time time trade-off

550
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,270
you you may have been times in planted

551
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,100
don't burn try that if you've got access
to one devices rate

552
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,310
you don't have access to other devices
primers engineering that

553
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,320
the firmware that gets loaded on that
can be easiest

554
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,220
arm as far as the men stuff goes he

555
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,629
someone to be in accordance with the
filesystems

556
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:52,360
I like the live something about matters
to

557
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,340
instead of being you know was a healthy
and Naomi

558
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,820
LCS you or something like that in the
header you may not seem that

559
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,190
or that the tools don't see that much
you add it to them the

560
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,570
in explaining sewing been one won't see
let's go

561
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:11,170
different heroin because a different
matter but it's there

562
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,850
if you're kinda like actually ripstop
around the binary image

563
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:23,430
in the gym

564
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,830
well what would you do with them
unlabeled

565
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,319
unlabeled Jade in like it was a

566
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,050
and more aboard his own label but
attention

567
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,869
much involved a asking us JK I would
probably

568
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,220
check with a chip is a good chip
manufacturer entries the games back

569
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,149
that probably the easiest thing cuz it's
all

570
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,340
documented that they've got JJ I'll

571
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,160
there's also there's only like four
lines you actually hinted to use its

572
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,490
tido reset and

573
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:03,490
something else chrome

574
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,540
0 that's funny sausages and they're only
when JJ

575
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,230
shopping a little bit I don't think it
would matter and you can solder on one

576
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,020
side and those

577
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,329
and then I remembered getting

578
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:20,810
I can neither confirm nor deny but I may
have moderate an x-box

579
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,609
you know put it put a chip-in and
everything like 20

580
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:31,029
were 26k where'd it go on a little tap
points on the board decided on getting

581
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,630
to jump around at Munchen on

582
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,329
so I can't do that with insider why
couldn't you know

583
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:43,270
Jade header you know just basically
cycle tap points on

584
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,009
shoes with your when they are as well as
you can look at that the

585
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,060
documentation CPU religion

586
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:54,349
orders yeah exactly Bollinger is almost
over

587
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:58,420
something like that is one of them
recent polls clock

588
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,760
mom hundred-dollar with analyzer

589
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,950
yes again say we're analyzing

590
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,430
logic analyzer yeah totally USB logic
analyzer raid

591
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,598
in your question

592
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,510
yup

593
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:25,220
%um

594
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,879
in

595
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,550
so there's two things

596
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:33,580
one and access the web interface
allowing you to read a book

597
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,200
like posted anything able to stop
responding

598
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,020
okay for something Ranger monthly figure
it out my current

599
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,259
yesterday's this image so all the image

600
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,640
down and started reading through that
firmware

601
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,060
and when volunteers the web directory
here's the scene was bosko

602
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,210
already and grab that and through
tonight bro

603
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,610
went through night bro I saw okay

604
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,860
here's these values are imposing then I
know

605
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,990
mean something but I I don't have any
open it's just sign

606
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,160
dying right by your side dying when they
did that

607
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,330
around in okay this is a you know arm

608
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,799
I can grab some Armco through the show
going back a bit

609
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,250
and posted both looked like symbols I
know

610
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,770
now I know what I've done so I know this
number

611
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:30,009
in

612
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,550
in

613
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:36,000
your question

614
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,560
cool thing what we have 10

615
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,890
yeah perfect goal

616
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,078
well thank you for coming you have any
questions please

617
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,240
feel free to let me know also scare

618
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,700
around the globe including where the day
takes them forever thank you

619
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,790
well
