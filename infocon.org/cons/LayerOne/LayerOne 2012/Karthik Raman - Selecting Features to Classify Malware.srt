1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,479
know who

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,819
everyone Sunday in Dayton I'm

3
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:11,240
our first time missus Brazeau or chrome

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,339
lawful when Norway's I suppose on last
night's partying

5
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:19,029
as her mom's and the stock is likely to
be

6
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,769
awesome gone

7
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:29,959
well thanks everyone for joining me this
early in the morning

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,140
my name's perfect and I work on the

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,390
Adobe secures opportunity I'll tell you
a little bit

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,860
but what my team does other team much
that we were gone

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,960
is the public security it's in response
team in were part of the wider

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,000
security within Adobe um so we are the
public face of security incident

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
response to the rest the world

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,690
and researchers send a report on
abilities to us

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,260
and we analyze the report to work with
the various proteins such as

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,070
return plus Pere Ubu examples I we work
with the seems to create the fixes

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,170
to verify the fixes we go back to the
researchers whose amid these reports

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,840
and once the pictures are good to go we
publish bulletins in a vase researchers

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,460
into

20
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,169
another project that arm I'm involved
with there's a project called not be

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,970
much sought-after protections program

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,110
and it's a it's a free notification
program

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,900
getting more though the details the for
supporters and

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,890
Adobe joins program in 2010 July and
we've been

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,509
active contributors to the condo in the
program services but the topic today

26
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,740
stock is something totally different I
wanted as this question to sort out my

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,570
car how many have

28
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,179
you have seen this serb screen on your
senior

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,970
on the screen of a loved one RM

30
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,170
so I'm I'm glad that they're so the
talks have been scheduled the way they

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,670
have been

32
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,119
on so the audience got a preview for
machine learning in

33
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,610
on whether the talks yesterday and
another talk there was some coverage

34
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,030
over mass Mauer and

35
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,600
and related to relation to botnets and
I'm glad we

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,548
we covers topics because a they're good
introduction to its on the material

37
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,629
covered them

38
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:15,480
and today the objectives are to so to
explain from high-level what the Mauer

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,230
promise

40
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,679
and into the question from the point of
view the user

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,959
um who sees craze like that we just saw
second ago and ask themselves how did I

42
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,440
just get victim

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,739
the second part is a brief introduction
to the application a machine learning

44
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,209
to the prom affirm our classification
and the

45
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,519
my my secret objective is asserted
introduce machine learning to

46
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,530
the people who haven't worked in the
field and the

47
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,879
sorta give you a roadmap for how you can
apply machine learning to

48
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,470
the Proms a Mauer and houses or other
beers agree bronze because it's a it's a

49
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,090
pair that

50
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,420
is picking up interest in our community
is was evident from the toxicity

51
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,510
in

52
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,299
okay so let's so was work to this story
them

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,360
you are a regular visitor to website and
the

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,019
that works on for size compromise a
couple months ago

55
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,840
a whistle-blowing website called crypto
not or was a compromise

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,150
and a was serving up drive-by exploits

57
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,310
so use user um

58
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,360
you not to computer savvy but you use a
computer you brother will obviously

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,590
and where the size that you trust is
compromised or

60
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,120
you get a link in the email and you
click on the link that you don't really

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,989
know much about

62
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,629
in your directed to a website that split
system

63
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,579
another technique that is used to rank
up pages and search results higher than

64
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,909
legitimate pages is a search engine
optimization so

65
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:45,590
whatever the technique you arms directed
to a website that is serving

66
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,780
exports in your serve something like
this

67
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,459
you know you have to spend a little bit
I'm in the JavaScript debugger

68
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,739
the office get this in on the top and
bottom it's yesterday cover

69
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,319
some other summit steps in the office
getting malicious javascript in

70
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,409
getting to the point where you can CEO
legitimate or malicious URL

71
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,280
decipher from this so what you did that
you'd be

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,470
redirected the user be redirected to
a.m.

73
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,569
something that looks legitimate but in
fact as malicious so

74
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,380
you know if the user were inspect the
starter this Euro he think that he's

75
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,839
going to

76
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,270
Google Analytics website but the up for
truncated the into the role because it's

77
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,979
malicious

78
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,030
and here she is routed to

79
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,570
through a series of Facebook's that
person in this is a topic does cover

80
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,099
yesterday

81
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,160
in so at the at the end of that scene
when the user's finally served to be

82
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,620
some our

83
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,009
they could be sir something like a
keylogger which is something that it's

84
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,240
all the south on the user's computer and
a

85
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,500
logs information types in in memory or
in

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,380
on arm unify Landis and then begins
information out there

87
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,050
the attacker servers or can be served a
backdoor

88
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,419
any other category Mauer would have to
be ok attackers printed is

89
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,880
is a recent the stage so

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,030
any bars that is installed on the user's
machine um

91
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,580
and the consensus is generally that
users of Windows computer should have

92
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,669
some sort of any bars installed

93
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,870
at this stage if ever spills you take
them our that served by that website at

94
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,000
the end that's enough Facebook sabers

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,340
that's when the user's machine
experiences

96
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,090
in a manner of speaking mushroom

97
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,460
were something like this if the Mauer's
poorly engineered

98
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,620
um could cause a was gonna death and
make the data on that user's computer

99
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,280
irreparable them but you'll notice them

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,780
so the equation I like the offer as the
as a model for

101
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,388
amassed now worse president effective is
the combination of mass power with

102
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,889
did AB signatures leads to mass
infections

103
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,919
and the topic that will analyze in more
depth

104
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,448
is the second piece in equation which is
why

105
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:03,860
dated 'em what we're doing here
babysitters and why don't singers get to

106
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,810
be did

107
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,930
so let's ask the question why do Amy
signatures yet to be out-of-date

108
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:17,090
one example is a one explanation is the
malware office cation testing recycle

109
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,090
home the two VM

110
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,099
georgian families that were mentioned in
the book that talk yesterday were

111
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,990
spotted I and Susan

112
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,740
as a coincidence that have a but I have
screenshots a to those

113
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,780
do prove my example so there's a special
piece by Trojan

114
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,679
if you purchase a copy of this but this
took it you'd see something like this

115
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,610
on on your machine and remember you're
bad at this point

116
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,720
and Oakley attention to him that the
circle on the screen which

117
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,960
is a appeal for encryption key to use
the backup

118
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,169
your setting up away from our infections

119
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,000
and you want to create a piece in our
thats undetected are fairly undetected

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
by

121
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,460
on scores a AB's what would he do that
when you use an interface like this

122
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,258
them specify a question encryption key

123
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,860
and euro EUR hopeful that the
concentrated he will bypass a bunch of

124
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,910
babies out there

125
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,979
and so if any signatures not pass a
written to a specific encryption key

126
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,219
then they'll miss the description of
this and detection at this piece an hour

127
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,880
because I think I should use changed

128
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,030
home another source of office
creationism

129
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,888
notified by is indicated by this like a
circle which is

130
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,310
'em the Packer UPS in this case ugly
quickly

131
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,470
for those are unfamiliar with the
Packers it's a she is

132
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,199
in which to coach Jim our on %uh Packers
like any other

133
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,560
technology have both legitimate and the
nefarious uses

134
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,729
a.m. Joseph your game developer you want
to protect your

135
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:48,330
game from being reverse-engineered are
making really hard for people to

136
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,800
users offer without paying a problem
I'll royalties then you might cook it

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,789
with them

138
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,539
a paper but the malicious use case years
02 she'd model within

139
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,818
apart preserving in the I'm scared
doesn't have

140
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:05,580
the means a unpacking home the specific
packer then it'll be completely

141
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,568
undetected by so in the spy case you
have both encryption

142
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:15,270
in the use OVA a Packers in

143
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,639
so step one was adding obfuscation
encryption to them our

144
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,750
the next step is quality assurance for
the power goes

145
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,449
they may send their samples to a website
like bar so how many people are familiar

146
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,270
with

147
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,469
parcel it so its website based in

148
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,709
in Spain and what it offers is a the
score AV software that can scan your

149
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,989
binders with

150
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,339
my fear AB analysts the the use cases

151
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,099
you're analyzing sampling you want quick
preview work other TV companies to take

152
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:44,339
the sample has

153
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,769
to: you may upload it there and the get
the reporter for what other people

154
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:53,300
detected as in what they're calling it
but backers could use it

155
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,219
you know equally and the have to figure
out how many if he's out there

156
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,000
detect the peace in our the trying to
set up in serb by this wave infections

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,050
in this case you know this is a strange
other random sample

158
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,760
seem like them 20 to 42 AB's detective
this particular sample

159
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,170
on other backers my lookin

160
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,839
this race you up detection or rather the
issue

161
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,790
OVA what is not depicted in this case
it's a 14

162
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,709
r-va over 42 babies that don't affect
this particular sample

163
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,949
and if that number is a too low

164
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,899
they may just go back to the drawing
board and say you know i i wanna more

165
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:33,660
effective

166
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,410
ma small campaign and one had different
kinds encryption or different kinds are

167
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:37,980
packing

168
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,519
or layers of packing in order to make
mine are more effective in fact is many

169
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,339
computers possible the first drawn

170
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,260
and you know this is Michelle Z but
trojan

171
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,760
and the if between our guys were unhappy
with that step up

172
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,250
but you a quality testing them for honey
AB's detected their peace an hour they

173
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,220
go back to the step

174
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:06,220
and add different guns in Kitchener per
pack 'em

175
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,630
hi Pak is as a

176
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,740
by over hide it all appoint a drive home
here is that the

177
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,320
the in addition to using singled out for
you know you can multiply VFX a

178
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,380
were packard us to make up Abyan
affected by

179
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,520
adding more more Packers in layers no
password for a brief minute and let you

180
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,520
guys read the app's activism

181
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,490
safe effective a Packer is to make the
job the Navy

182
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,460
on less effective then you can multiply
that by adding

183
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,500
wears a Packers and that's what this
budget does now this is an academic

184
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,029
project and the results are published
methodology is published

185
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,580
but doesn't strain imagination do the
say that

186
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,040
the bad guys could have no custom setups
like this and other is best for the

187
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,529
actuate testing in the

188
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,880
once they once they have a a strain of
bomb

189
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,760
Packers a added onto their now where the
that's when they're happy with and use

190
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,220
'em

191
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,960
in summary beam our office gets Justin
Lee cycle begins with them

192
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,190
you know a toolkit that lets people
that's the Maori guys

193
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,350
add um encryption and difficult about
this guy should be

194
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,210
pass it on to the be public AV scanning
engines such as parcel

195
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,960
or use things like gun pipe do I
different kinds of players are packing

196
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,910
if they're happy with her unhappy with
how many AB's detected they'll go back

197
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,589
this up one

198
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:42,690
and change up the encryption office
kitchen once

199
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,000
their content with the level of
detection bill serving

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,270
in a massive our campaign by infected
web pages and

201
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,560
drive-by explore downloads and once that
waiver for infection is successful in

202
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,969
AB catches up with the lag will go back
to stop once or another

203
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,060
campaign of mass bomber so that's that's
a vicious cycle

204
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,170
forearm Mauer mass power and from the
point of view the user

205
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,459
user doesn't care about others would
what you see she's

206
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,680
suffers is this unfortunately these
screenshots

207
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,040
love malicious programs to pretend to be
legitimate

208
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,510
um and he's actually screenshots from
the mix up in our production

209
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,910
cinderblock a fake antivirus

210
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,050
or ransomware programs user who doesn't
know better

211
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,319
believes or is conniving to believing
that deliver programs

212
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,690
if they pay a fifty dollar or something
license before though

213
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,990
vote-getter infection with these
programs are nothing but but scanned

214
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,730
using

215
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,160
to the five by discussing all that is is
this a

216
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,910
this is is that Mauer from our the
suffered a life-cycle

217
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,860
outpaces that of an adverse and in a lot
of cases in this economic during

218
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,190
bomb Mauer guys make a lotta money from
doing this and

219
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,490
some somewhere that's that's part other
their motives in in Paris

220
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,260
and the endeavour's industry is a Islam

221
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,670
so the National question asked at this
point is a on

222
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,209
what we make maybe more current have to
make the job may be more affected

223
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:22,630
and is serving the the research in this
'em an automatic answer is a

224
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,910
well you've got you've got a I mean
everything

225
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,130
and Research discusses things like
selling protection which is a

226
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,770
detecting malware for what it looks like
detecting hour for

227
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,770
what it does dynamic detection

228
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,069
detection the clouds 0 detecting certain
features on our or the preponderance of

229
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,779
a certain

230
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,360
Hashem our but is there anything else
the weekend 'em

231
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,560
a wealthy speak about his look the way
they do because they remind me of the

232
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,170
silence Battlestar Galactica

233
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,680
and it's just a coincidence because we
need the salas from possible active on

234
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,469
our site

235
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,279
we machine learning but the machine
learning is the %uh the process of

236
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,810
extracting useful knowledge

237
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:09,810
from masses a datum

238
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,900
so transitioning into part to the talk
which is a

239
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,529
defining more terms and the building up
our knowledge towards

240
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,570
how we can apply machine learning to
help us by Mauer

241
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,660
just above ours briefly because this is
a term that

242
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,279
is done about easily and the maybe some
so people know the original definitions

243
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,290
for Cohen who wrote the first computer
virus and was one of the original

244
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,110
researchers and the universe

245
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,450
field the final farce as a program that
can infect other programs by modifying

246
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,120
and include possibly involve copy vids
of

247
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,680
nasa people complain about that mission
that it could also apply to

248
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,959
general-purpose program such as
compilers

249
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,489
NP resort was another home I'm a
researcher in

250
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,050
or the earliest researchers in in the
industry redefined the virus

251
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,219
as a program the Kings aggressively
explicitly copy

252
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,740
possibly balk opulence of and this is
the most widely but

253
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:06,030
accepted definition the bar system

254
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,920
those they could quick trip down memory
lane computer memory lane berries

255
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,339
this is a screenshot I for one of the
original computer viruses

256
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,420
call Brehm and via interesting thing
about brain was the

257
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,439
but the address above the people wrote
the largest

258
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,010
was embedded within the machine language
go to the bars um so

259
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,360
brain spread by bob Bennett sneaker net
and the

260
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,319
it would you know you'd have to add and
surviving is a machine that had brain

261
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:36,160
on it your copies of onto the disk in
your walk over to another machine

262
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,839
and youths would spread bring like that
now I'm

263
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,470
because people in India CD or CD-rom
have secured a

264
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,280
Tech Talk home sometime back in which
she look at the summer language of brain

265
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,040
and assets of the question so do these
guys still the guys who wrote this first

266
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,020
to be still live

267
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,589
at this address and he actually went to
this address and knocked on their door

268
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,240
in

269
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,130
on yellowing bill they were still there
so how do you like that tech talk at the

270
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,680
end of the song

271
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,300
it's a it's a pretty need to enact them

272
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,530
from spreading via sneaker net for
flopping at home

273
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,100
worms or viruses evolve to spreading by
exploiting

274
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,810
operating system on Billy's and this all
broad strokes in the evolution in our

275
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,979
um so when I get when I went back to my
college campus at the end of

276
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,630
the summer of 2003 though the internet
was down

277
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,230
obscure is somewhat the IT department
and they said yeah we've been getting

278
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,180
hit by the MS Blaster Worm

279
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,680
so that's my personal relationship with
him as the storm not be able use the

280
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,439
network

281
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,750
but if you look at the machine was good
with animus blaster

282
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,589
a you know the bar service actually tend
to do is a lot they'll put in

283
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,740
english-language messages in the mail
them plead to the Mrs Ellis said

284
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,760
to use a particular name for the bar as
we just ignore that stuff but it's

285
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,550
interesting to study share

286
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,170
picked the writer both s Blosser put in

287
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,290
message to Bill Gates stop made what do
you make this possible start making

288
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,579
money in Texas awful

289
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:07,379
but and they did they pass it within a
couple weeks

290
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,270
so in addition to being the device used
by via

291
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,579
the Greeks deceits Troy for computer
viruses

292
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,129
a Trojan horse is what we've seen so far
it's is a program the protest to be

293
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,630
legitimate but in fact does something
batter does nothing at all

294
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,780
but scan the you certain

295
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,899
okay so we're almost really done with
part one

296
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,220
bummer doing very good on time lemme

297
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,310
any questions over but problem

298
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,090
alright so we're gonna look at machine
learning for

299
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,840
now across pitching

300
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,100
more definitions up the scope of the
research was classification polymorphic

301
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,629
Mauer

302
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,230
particularly what I mean by polymorphic

303
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,730
me some our has multiple variants and
does not affect other programs

304
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,350
you may call a virus that mutates
revolves a

305
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,550
an effector um in you may call a bar as
the mutates and changes that shape

306
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,149
a you could call a metamorphic so those
two categories of viruses

307
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,210
we're outta school for my research

308
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,310
examples above what is in scope 'em

309
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,389
are back doors which a program to run in
the background

310
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,990
collect information and begin at the
b.tech preservers

311
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,480
downloaders which them Donald other
programs in that the user have a

312
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,919
presence on rushing

313
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,130
want to cut while the tools and the user
that the attacker could download on

314
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,350
on a machine is rap a remote
administration tool

315
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,370
was lets him a run command a machine and
perhaps like

316
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,449
to about matters I believe them

317
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,409
infect urs and and Packers are
descriptive the objective observer

318
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:48,890
packard is to make

319
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,419
one binary resemble another as much as
possible sofa by recanting sections that

320
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,150
the

321
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,659
are low entropy the objective the
Packers to make the sections

322
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:01,150
within the boundary as and as high
attributes possible

323
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,470
on and that's more difficult progress
using machine learning them

324
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,590
trying to pass by files that were
originally not packed

325
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,610
so that's that's within the scope of
this research

326
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,280
okay so wise polymorphic Marc Mauer
important in

327
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,980
home how much a bit is out there in
relation to the other carriers an hour

328
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,100
on this page are both from a couple
weeks ago

329
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,709
for with what percentage amount were
detected in the book Senate members

330
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,940
Mauer out there is trojans which are
polymorphic

331
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,940
as opposed to other categories in our so
going eighty percent

332
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,950
little more amplification what I mean by
polymorphic this is a

333
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,140
a family of termite species a termite
the

334
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,680
on the left is became termite aid be

335
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,690
is a is a queen termite CND

336
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,730
or secondary and tertiary Queens the

337
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,750
is soldier termites and F

338
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,990
is a worker termites now these all these
are all the same species but

339
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,510
the they don't look the same the you
know there to similar in appearance

340
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,629
but doesn't mean that we have to
classify them differently so

341
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,170
polymorphism is a

342
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,260
the labeling of one thing is one species
regardless of how they appear because

343
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,450
their functions the same

344
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,950
they're all term as they do similar
things their spawn more prism in

345
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,400
Battlestar Galactica how many Battlestar
Galactica fans here

346
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,250
alright them the silos are polymorphic
they

347
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:33,260
they have similar purposes but they look
different lemme

348
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,680
to say you cheap classification what are
some of the other steps are following

349
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,550
the methodology for on analyzing
binaries for it and Avars noses

350
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,970
the next up was clustering so you
classify Mauer as

351
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,940
malicious or clean in for the files that
you possibly as malicious the next up is

352
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,060
to sign families

353
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,669
on that's what's meant by clustering

354
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,060
go hand in hand with clustering
something was detection so this is the

355
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,100
most commonly used term for any bars and
immerses detect Mauer but

356
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,149
what what's going on behind the scenes
as the question has happened and

357
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,600
classification preceded that

358
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,469
and if your system is already been
infected by be some hour then

359
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,030
after detective the end of our spots
deleted and clean up any

360
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,850
other remnants like registry cheeser
remnants in memory so that the Maori

361
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,300
doesn't respond on rebooting

362
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,180
and then delete whatever else is left on
on the system's 0 on a high level that's

363
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,200
what a modem

364
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,770
and bars scanning including

365
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,230
I'm so the course in the research
there's a lot of solar research and one

366
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,360
give users a preview the stuff so

367
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,840
you're interested in it you look it up
isley read it all

368
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,189
group based in Germany the mine our
behavior based on

369
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,480
sandboxes the collected sandbox logs and
use those logs features two

370
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,670
defeated machine learning algorithms so
in general this is a machine learning

371
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,580
approach to

372
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,990
analyzing passed by Mauer a

373
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,860
two groups separately used a search
engine method

374
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,570
to Pro Class one hour so they looked at
the card into the mouth were

375
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,879
and the added to certain neighbors and
when unknown

376
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,230
binary came bother with it is stuck
somewhere features and do a search

377
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,290
engines or look up

378
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,430
so when you start something on Google it
doesn't look up a

379
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,580
the corpus luteum when it whatever
similar mom

380
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,949
co-signed mom some Larry mother for
example and that's what the applied to

381
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,480
problem our masochism

382
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,610
from our detection 'em another group
Burnham

383
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,800
use it today from biology known as
phylogeny which is

384
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,879
term that means building up a family
tree of power

385
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,380
and once you apply this technique 'em

386
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,480
my own already be classified in within a
tree that was indicative

387
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,170
its malicious nature and whenever
appropriate cattery blockade

388
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,350
another technique was used both and
perms

389
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,840
a.m. and perms is the print edition
opening grams anyone familiar with women

390
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:03,840
in Graham is would you mind if I need
'em

391
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,449
hun

392
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,399
line

393
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,239
%um

394
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,580
them

395
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,620
dream

396
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,158
book top

397
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,870
so big my n-grams exactly that their

398
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,379
the use the government listings but you
can apply them the concept and

399
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,960
tomorrow you can basically say I'll
defining you need to be

400
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,740
one by or issues abides and a sequence
have

401
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,340
those units becomes in Bram if you
permitted that

402
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,439
in which you don't care about the order
in which those units appear

403
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,450
as an interim pollute the user to take
like that the to build a phylogeny

404
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,649
and it was an application about machine
learning surgeon approach

405
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,789
in whatever approach was

406
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:51,970
using the control flow graphs within the
buyer is an hour or two

407
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,919
derive a fingerprint at the lower and
this is a geometric or structural

408
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,799
similarity approach

409
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,190
in a a defective did something somewhere
they they looked at

410
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,139
draw photographs and basic blocks and
also used machine learning research

411
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:05,799
engines

412
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:09,779
in and there's there's a lot of
theoretical research also

413
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,320
in how to normalize Garces so people
define

414
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,379
home formal use formal logic formal
methods to

415
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,240
'em specify the syntax and semantics um
what's been doing within

416
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,730
a binary and then if firm by applying
normalization methods

417
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,200
binders that are similar would be more
more similar by news that are

418
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,559
different would be more more distant and
then the final using a clustering method

419
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:32,918
do

420
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,470
suburban with them now or in the same
families

421
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,210
okay so that's a broad strokes overview
of what's going on in

422
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,659
and detection in a clustering
fingerprinting is also a common method

423
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,029
that people use and

424
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,840
bro million and John and Witcher ski
both published by company are those for

425
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,820
causing or so

426
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,120
if you're doing this for fun are you
doing this for job look at their papers

427
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,629
in

428
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,139
and then from there are problems for on
profess ring

429
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:04,260
and a group A since been

430
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,549
on use distance algorithms to

431
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,190
to find some hour or so the project
other that you

432
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,630
they put my hour into Euclidean space
and

433
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,830
summer now will be close to each other
in that space

434
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,220
in part on other group based in Germany
'em

435
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,240
can use machine learning arm and the the
driver behavior profile Mauer and the

436
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,889
source actually available for anyone to
use

437
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:32,500
so nervous in

438
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,889
so neither would look good all the
services up there on

439
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:41,120
I want to give you 'em methodology that
I followed through the use machine

440
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,580
learning to play declassification

441
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,100
for service to extract features in

442
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,149
then you train the models using the
features extracted in the models would

443
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:53,639
general classifiers if you're happy with
the

444
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:56,750
result to the Class A farr's you use
them to casper

445
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,870
unknown files is as a 0 which might be
clean

446
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,549
and one is malicious during

447
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,179
and in the beginning I a certain with
600 features derived from

448
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,179
a binary phone

449
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:13,179
so what is about what I mean by unable
'em

450
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:16,740
the majority of systems out there so
lemme

451
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,299
32-bit and the the XY&Z lol

452
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:23,490
are public's goodwill file formats for
32-bit

453
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,760
systems on the standard is is public you
could go the Microsoft website and

454
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,389
download the standard in

455
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:34,629
a.m. to already give you preview with
this look like visually

456
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,909
this is it this is a tool called the
file inside

457
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:40,960
and it it has a p/e parser built into it

458
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,389
so if you you open a binary within that
hehe the structures within

459
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:49,070
a particular P file missus a section be
far from the Peter

460
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,789
in the P also contains

461
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:57,149
on sections within its own so dont text
Rd in

462
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:00,459
resources all sections it also could
contain

463
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,090
imports so what will use is from the
operating systems

464
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,918
the I'm that's too I mean by important
and deals might also have

465
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,120
exports so there's there's a
functionality program to the deal and

466
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,449
another program was use it so that's
what's meant by an expert

467
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,450
in this binder doesn't have exports in

468
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,980
a little more about what I mean by
features in um

469
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,350
this is this is the premier of Lower and
the the picture on the left and the

470
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:26,668
right

471
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:30,000
are both from you love are so which one
is the Corolla

472
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,639
egypt was the killers in the both in the
same place in both these flowers

473
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:36,959
it features three the stamen is in a
different place in

474
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,720
so is feature for missus does do
features 34 make these two different

475
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,629
bars no they don't

476
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:46,529
there just in different positions and
where their defensive positions

477
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:50,159
in the functional polymorphism in
biology

478
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,190
is to let the species be more robust in
the basal

479
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,929
laboratory have a serious and predators
and a similar logic involved for

480
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,919
on more from our way to them our writers
grow introduce polymorphism into the

481
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,360
lower

482
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,990
they want them out to be more robust in
the face a detection by a bus

483
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,379
in southern

484
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:13,080
knew was that I exploring in this
research is why much fewer features

485
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,869
be better then more features defeated
machine learning algorithms

486
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:21,580
their first its 102 did you think that
the more dailies a body a problem

487
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,869
the better results you get in actually
that's not true

488
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,360
the text books I'm sure to tell you that
irrelevant features actually distract

489
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,320
the machine learning

490
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,360
algorithms by using the property
features you can

491
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,860
improve the performance you can
represent the prom better it also helps

492
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,939
the user because they are distracted by

493
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,480
be irrelevant features so back an
example the

494
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,260
the premier of Lower if the basis of our

495
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,610
had been used as a featured separate
something as a premier livre something

496
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,678
that wasn't

497
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,080
it's no use at all because it's the same
in both the body a

498
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,809
examples of the Permian

499
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,039
the recent pictures which is that's that
was most relevant to the south I was

500
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,750
doing

501
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,590
'em reasonable doubt is that a lot of
people have achieved

502
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,389
very good accuracy in the results and as
I steinbrenner think you have what are

503
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:11,539
the questions I could try to

504
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:14,570
pursuit it seem like there are two key
questions that

505
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,460
'em were still unaddressed by the
existing research

506
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,179
the first these was which features could
be used in machine learning from us

507
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:25,869
Beijing classifying our in washington

508
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:30,279
and earlier question was what are the
minimum features for classification

509
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,419
so love these love this research would
would take all the features available

510
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,610
or pretty fun center features but not
focus on

511
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,299
minimizing that features to figure out
what sediment features were necessary to

512
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:43,360
possible in

513
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,719
and the I was able actually drug XO
classifieds using 27 features

514
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,789
for that there is something

515
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,889
and how this could be used as a could be
an existing where to anniversary margin

516
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:58,649
but doesn't doesn't mean the end the
baby you know we still need

517
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,020
on Packers in the office Gators a man
all the other stuff that

518
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:08,559
that bone or currently part of
University margin

519
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,559
cited the system look you have a dataset
which is your corpus among our and

520
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,369
carport percent clean files

521
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:18,309
from which instructed using a person
this is shared across a bar which is

522
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,460
machine learning over them which has
been trained to identify

523
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,639
somethings malicious and something
that's clean on

524
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:28,090
so when you're treating these customers
originally you want evaluate them so you

525
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,309
you take the model that comes out the
possible or

526
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:33,700
in your valuating for you know with the
with the false-positive rates are what

527
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,110
the actor seasons on other metrics

528
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,990
if your cell sudden devaluation you may
take the model in music within

529
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,289
be another testing system

530
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:46,340
the beginning the assert with the

531
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,879
to from a partnership with the talk
about P don't which is a

532
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:55,049
jazz a legacy tool for parsing people
people often

533
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,190
and later when I when i'm just still
those users to tool that

534
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,799
other people too run I use the P file
Python module

535
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:05,700
which is a is an open source model

536
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,830
was like this it it was a hundred
thousand them more than 100000 pieces

537
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,110
from our from the

538
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,750
the experience website if you've been
following the

539
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,200
the whisper in in news a few months ago
this what's that was

540
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,590
actually shut down so I did this
research in good time

541
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,970
on the city doesn't the programs came
from basin solutions a

542
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,299
Windows XP Monessen

543
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:33,230
assert with 16:45 features initially
features extracted from

544
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,440
properties of the people for men

545
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,590
it's all the features I had a couple it
so machine learning

546
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,820
algorithms they tend to accept a certain
kinda feature

547
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,119
you know to be on numeric on normal
nominal all binary

548
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,840
I decide to go with numeric features
because the seem to represent what's the

549
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,250
deal with the phone

550
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,080
and so some the corporation's had to be
whether something contained

551
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,599
an employer whether something put in an
expert for example

552
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,750
so that's that's what I mean by
chocolate features

553
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:07,369
and Matt Peters article it was very
insightful and helpful in

554
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:12,590
manassas in

555
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,860
for the class part about where I use an
open-source java project called Michael

556
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,510
and if you're starting out

557
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,980
with a machine learning I'd say this is
absolutely the place is sort of with

558
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,650
because it dramatically cut

559
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,980
my learning curve about machine learning
um so

560
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,890
there's there's a lot about rhythms
machine learning that have been

561
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,890
implemented by this

562
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,490
but this framework and its is really
awesome because

563
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,940
is also suitable so you need to use that
to you you figured out

564
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,510
which objectives are in in driving class
apart you could do

565
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,580
just simply tell week ago on to run the
possible are

566
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:50,490
on your data behind-the-scenes in

567
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,840
so I ran six numeric machine learning
algorithms on my data

568
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,230
and I sold within 45 features in the
second experiment with 100 futures

569
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,350
um and I i also-ran a

570
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,600
these classifiers individually against
particular features

571
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,750
and I want to take the classification so

572
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,020
missus use the results in some ways
which is a pretty high accuracy

573
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,040
but wait a min

574
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,690
you know that is from Battlestar
Galactica in

575
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,950
the open

576
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,490
the open

577
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,640
check the classification some these
features individually

578
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,920
had really really high ackerson

579
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,430
and that actually that that those
staggering because you know in theory

580
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,280
you could use just

581
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,860
why these features to separate an hour
from the file for the desert

582
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:45,610
you have actors in ninety .3 foreperson

583
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,560
okay so death to the question is a
possible drive

584
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,899
a feature set its as small as possible
is so using all

585
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,990
all the available features how to go
about them I want about grouping

586
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,510
the P structure headers into buckets

587
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,780
in K-seven buckets based on

588
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,330
the portions are the people in the art
room for driving his main features that

589
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,219
when something like this

590
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:14,609
asserted with just one feature from the
first book in

591
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,179
around all the art rooms I was
interested in running went to the next

592
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,639
book in

593
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,460
took the best feature from not buggin
and then ran v6 machine learning

594
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,110
algorithms

595
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,410
with those two features so continue this
process and and no to my results for

596
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:32,719
1 through 7 features 17 were done I went
back to the first bucket

597
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,989
and take the next best feature not but
and they continue

598
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,520
surrenders for 13 iteration so all the
way to seven and then back

599
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,179
13 and if the question that

600
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,400
if the question that is a possible drive
in movie features said

601
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,580
for good classification our could be
answered the national scene

602
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,630
inflection point in my results after a
certain minimum set of features were met

603
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:59,560
after with the results were just similar
in the gain in accuracy was minimum

604
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,850
any that there was a case so these
results from

605
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:10,259
instant based on where the machinery or
chrome to use and here you see after 7

606
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,920
features

607
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,410
there's an inflection point and begin
accuracy is

608
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,120
is not as dramatic as given accuracy all
the way through the for some features

609
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,259
in so results for the G 48

610
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,590
class far in G-forty craft

611
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,020
at the checkpoint some features in

612
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,080
server for part just like this inflexion
point six but

613
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,730
for consistency of this is something

614
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,320
summary for rent a porcelain

615
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,550
writer okay so

616
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,350
that took just the seven features and
use them as the

617
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:51,020
the soul and but still the classifiers
in

618
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,490
and with just the same features it seem
like I was able to drive

619
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:59,379
really really hate accuracy in impasse
by Mauer so those 19.21 accuracy

620
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,240
and the false-positive rate was

621
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,410
really high so you know if you doing
this

622
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:10,069
commercially if you doing is an approach
system you probably should not use

623
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,480
machinery other than for other the gate
without opposition to Nick

624
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,320
but it's not raining we got a 90 point
to 1 percent accuracy

625
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,950
430,000 be some our which is some
features

626
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,129
in d-mass how did

627
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,620
heard the song features individually or
in combination works so well

628
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,910
in what seemed like they were picking

629
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,279
the machine learning algorithms were
picking the features the recep rating

630
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,670
power from clean files

631
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,110
me net adding the other features in
nominal so

632
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,960
we in are many losses pick the seven
features in our dataset

633
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,550
the separated the two possibly classes
have been blessed then we would need to

634
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,200
worry about

635
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,720
collecting the data for other features
in extracting machine learning

636
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,290
algorithms

637
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,550
in and for my dataset

638
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,970
these are the same features on can read
them on the screen but

639
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,740
too familiar with the I wasn't structure
by human wrecking somebody's

640
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,799
in devote size denotes the sizeof

641
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,820
the debug directly table and other one

642
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,330
explanation postmark just because we
don't have

643
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,870
the data to back it up one possible
explanation puts up is that

644
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,810
this is a good feature separate power
from thing files because only Microsoft

645
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,980
related execute a Bulls

646
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,450
I'm deals at this feature populated
another hour that

647
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,730
that was in my dataset add any value
said in this spin

648
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,490
to meet with those good feature for the
machine learning algorithms to separate

649
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,450
clean from dirty a similar logic applied
to

650
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,779
image version which notes the version
via um

651
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,690
in only Microsoft related binaries have
this value set to something is non-zero

652
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,600
and although

653
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,860
all the power they realize that this and
nothing

654
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:52,860
so in my calculations ok this feature
values are dissatisfied is Aaron

655
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:57,180
the mighty use the models that you you
generate from train classifiers

656
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,310
government class I P file defeated to a
parser

657
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,790
the parser feeds the data to model the
model gives you a result basically

658
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,529
input and output in

659
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,180
you plug all this into existing
infrastructures on the desktop

660
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,060
you could use it to consolidate
signature database so you have a trove

661
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,720
Mauer

662
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,470
that you wanna detecting and classifying
you know if you have

663
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,799
she succeeded his you could run machine
running against is that it is

664
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,460
and drive a compressed model that
captures what I'm always

665
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,590
in the cloud you could be more
aggressive with the

666
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,750
the raid in which you're on these are
items on you can use it to quickly

667
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,920
detect Mossbauer

668
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,950
spreading within across computers

669
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,140
on the Gateway perhaps you could uses
most aggressively on

670
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,220
you actually prevent once in spring by
buying some other

671
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,950
some other models that you've been

672
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,490
so I distilled allow this research into
a quick to

673
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,720
gold mark on safaris on SourceForge
already you want to take a look at it

674
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,740
the objective that is to share this
research for the community in as sort of

675
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,200
a

676
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,310
hope you guys build on it is an open
source license so you can

677
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,520
build on it at Wilton in causing

678
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,930
I say that if you're interested machine
learning for computer security and

679
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,750
general

680
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,800
in our suspicion in particular

681
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,880
police are waco because you'll save
yourself a lot of time

682
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,220
I was faced with the either calling the
machine learning algorithms myself

683
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,009
or using waco and you can imagine what
time is it by using with them

684
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,740
there's a book that their companies work
a it's not free but I highly recommend

685
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,720
it because it uses work as its teaching
model

686
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,209
and %uh the publishers that anything
over up

687
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,400
getting example would machine learning
isn't there's a

688
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,420
there's a big cat in the weeds and its
orbit simplifies the definition of a

689
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:51,670
extracting useful knowledge from from
not brought it in

690
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,300
so other shipping classes person foreign
going to speak with someone you make me

691
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,500
ask so

692
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,750
I just talked about 7 features that
sovereign hour from thing

693
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,100
files from a dataset if there's an hour
of their out there

694
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,310
reads my paper and says you know I know
the same features and I'm going to

695
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,220
program mom hour or so that though some
features fall the bus to the search

696
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:11,970
features fall

697
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,390
within the brothers that I expect the
phone Brooklyn programs

698
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,470
and the guess who that is yes sure but
it doesn't really change the

699
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,470
the nation the but the arms reasons
already existing

700
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,649
not i think is a quote from from the
book the bad guys can also use machine

701
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,460
learning

702
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,340
I'll any science and technology both a
good about because by guessing use the

703
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,240
same things

704
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,089
but ken the human analyst benefit from

705
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,830
using machinery I think so um get anyone
here tell me

706
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,120
which these to the projector lens and
was in these two is a camera lens

707
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:51,120
anyone want to guess in

708
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,598
on the rise him bill

709
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,359
would you would would you agree that
it's terrible hard

710
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,359
thing do heart question answer so the
point driving

711
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:08,029
at his the the technology to in a
project like in this trial you to create

712
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:09,890
like well

713
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,129
is to capture light is very similar and
the

714
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,849
the analogy is the technology the right
person to call you to detect viruses

715
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:18,890
will also resemble

716
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,799
each other and you know so the guys can
use machine learning but

717
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:26,740
I think he can buy the good guys more
time and when we're faced with like tons

718
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,189
in our community every day

719
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,450
by using machine learning algorithms
that sultry

720
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,299
and self-correcting the humorless could
be focused on

721
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:38,339
the more longer-term research in more
important questions that

722
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:44,230
you know is a less taxing on

723
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,930
and I think that the Indian she gets hit
a lot with his is a high-profile

724
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,368
false-positive in

725
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:55,359
now I can say what your business 'em

726
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,249
how your business some assigns costs to
what false positives and false negatives

727
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:00,538
new technology or

728
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:04,049
with anything on machine learning is if
you have a value to plug into

729
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:07,630
these equations for machine learning I'm
not to be one of the inputs used to

730
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,730
train your classifiers

731
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,489
you can pass by thats atoned to your
particular business problem

732
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:18,569
and everyone's population is going to be
different segment on with been

733
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,999
followed is due please consider the
privacy the user

734
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,180
if you're running this a machine
learning infrastructure

735
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,640
for the text in class by Mauer in the
cloud and you

736
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,670
wantonly extract features from from
developers machines for example

737
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,900
you can be tracked things things like
strings from developers machines which

738
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,599
League intellectual property into the
cloud and if there's a bridge then

739
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,999
we know what particular company was
working on a it

740
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:47,399
to that it's a there is research a
privacy preserving data mining it was

741
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,200
actually out a scope of the textbook are

742
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,538
burdensome a you're interested in the
place look at the

743
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,670
research in the field in

744
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,690
the summer research I alluded to those
most post my own research

745
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:05,690
home your interest in the stuff please
do repairs in

746
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,630
to the tech talking about about were
Mikko Hypponen goes to the address

747
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,109
in question uva the guys who wrote the
brain Marcin

748
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:19,960
in has a conversation with them in

749
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:26,960
in my thanks to be references for images
in Compton

750
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,200
so gonna leave you with I'm a bouncer
collected keep

751
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,299
will leave you with my contribution to
the problem classify silence

752
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,250
about like as if you don't watch the
show towards their the show

753
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,810
your objective is to classify who is a
Cylon

754
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:47,220
whose human because the silence was on
what humans to you don't have four

755
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,589
seasons to catch up

756
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:53,250
in I'm gonna give you were you before
silence

757
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,120
him it's not all of them it's all and a

758
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,160
I'll tell you that might bypass official
has a false positive rate

759
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,870
a 20-person so you just have to watch
the show to correct them

760
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,980
that's it so yeah that's my email
address

761
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,270
you have any questions and the tulip
distill some research ideas

762
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,600
up on SourceForge is an open-source

00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,450
up to get a custom

764
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,180
bar soap virus BIRR US

765
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,299
t otal in

766
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,320
sir

767
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,299
here

768
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:36,980
just

769
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,150
them

770
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,910
on sir

771
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:46,799
out so it's always been sewing machine
learning to over fit your

772
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,450
your models to our dataset rather than
solving the general problem so that's a

773
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,339
valid concern

774
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,870
and much chance for the availability
have been programs

775
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,870
and whatever dirty for real I could get
my hands on them

776
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:02,009
concert like prove or disprove this
happens not but this is was yeah it's

777
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,590
possible with a few feature two separate
clean dirty so

778
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,430
if you reply this research you have to
use different programs interviews more

779
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,419
files to make engineered to

780
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,390
the wire from in one min

781
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:22,390
wells but thank you very much well

782
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,790
problem

783
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,040
