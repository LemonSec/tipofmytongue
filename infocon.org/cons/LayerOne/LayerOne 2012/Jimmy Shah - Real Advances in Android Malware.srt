1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,160
okay

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,250
up my thoughts on nom is it all just

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,800
SMS viruses on and we would not or we
actually seeing real advances in Android

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,269
malware

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,740
take a look at numbers actually I will
be okay here now I'll

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,279
basically exit use to be pretty much
most in our but right now we're seeing a

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,560
lot of new things like a

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,788
spyware receded pups leader potentially
unwanted programs

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,900
a spyware your hacking tools your own

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,399
various some Mian Lee actually the
program so we may know one on on device

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,670
bench thinking about 50 percent we have
a great how the right now

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,020
but look at the actual break down when
we got there %ah

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,219
yes SMS premiums in the SMS sending an
hour still there

14
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,239
oh we've got things like from getting to
the good guy X button

15
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,468
using tools and quite a bit of things
and send the information to people

16
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,890
to the attackers so people know what's
on your phone we question how many

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,809
people of you have them both times

18
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,500
ok it's no majority rule pretty much has
an Android phone

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,720
pretty much all you guys can be infected
by

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,100
carjackers you're coming from basically
on russia and China

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,890
as long as you're not going to alarm
we're sticking to the official Android a

22
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,619
play market

23
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,530
were play with words alternate Google
Play home

24
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,560
you're pretty much can avoid a lot of
what's out there I'll take a look at it

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,409
she's the man the actual tax them

26
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,049
now we know there is not exist there
what what's what's actually attacking

27
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:27,850
years as in what

28
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,658
getting older what are these guys the
bad guys attackers were the action using

29
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,780
on your system

30
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,810
where you can get a whole is not only do
it once they're there

31
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,079
I'll okay but that's nice

32
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,669
the it PDF yeah alright

33
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,100
okay actual tucker tricks I wanna got
here

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,439
are asking to sing before he could get
the simple inscription like Ghana

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,889
obfuscation mom we just got like the SMS
number something simple like that or

36
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,470
like this

37
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,469
with simple so positions over three
other configuration file as ago we could

38
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:01,780
call it something mean that simple very
basic

39
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,299
they got up from nap their really do a
lot more these base using

40
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:08,590
DS NDS in cambodia traffic

41
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,800
are your command control command I'll
did its Italian

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,010
miss your personal data like your IMEI
or would you write an offer for your

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,579
phone

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,599
I'll you're you're basically you're
you're you're in some cases your Google

45
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,349
what Calgary Alberta Calgary cool
accountant

46
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,670
information gets 14 and equiped allow
this is because the attackers are

47
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,290
worried about

48
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,700
other attackers basic okay you got a
botnet I got a bonnet

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,480
he's got a bonnet much like joe said
earlier about the five-wicket on one

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,040
machine

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,670
if you're infected you don't want some
I'll take your information you want to

52
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,890
basic pushed him outta there

53
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,268
and you can make sure everything to be
going over the network and

54
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,330
within the fun took the minor

55
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,760
I but now the big thing though is the
up-front basically I'll

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,480
waterfront happen what do you what you
can do in frogmen a mixer sure it did

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,510
your have an application that could be
we'll could be fake

58
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,429
it basically pretend to be fake and
Kenley they have

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,060
mostly the code is made up of just the

60
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,060
militia Moshe Katsav not like actual my
county that make you do anything

61
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,129
iomega potentially be an alarm Elena
came out maybe ten to be your man your

62
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,250
security of your bank

63
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,550
i in the case a pic talk in particular
it is it going to be like Windows the

64
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,970
you type in your password and you get
your arm

65
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,109
key code for the next transaction which
works out well for the attacker but it

66
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,840
doesn't do anything

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,670
other than that but bush at the end
button which is really close to my page

68
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,220
number

69
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,580
here okay a case in point of a token

70
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,810
this pretends to be a kik illegally the

71
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,790
akiko thing or a key code took in Los of
tokens like an hour say to him

72
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,500
legally the car with a rope you know but
it changes every minute or so

73
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,590
in in this case you in your pure passer
document that cocaine

74
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,819
and insane when it does it to be good
your big number

75
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,409
and it to forward the password needed
activities account over to the attacker

76
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:12,560
sneaky useful and the course be safe or
any not doing a little work here it all

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,230
in Java

78
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,459
it's basically just to put together an
interface for you to see what's going on

79
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:22,220
and stealing information from them in
your things open more advanced something

80
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,009
like %ah

81
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,639
you want one click fraud family why one
click fraud it did seem a two-piece

82
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,130
email or where you got my car a drive-by
download where you go to a

83
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,850
the or visit the website and boom me
back a girl

84
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,139
%uh dollar-billion the dollar how to
make up the system one could force to

85
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:37,699
move up

86
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,500
exhibit actually a is an adult
entertainment app

87
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,650
handed pretends to be like I sensed
charging for a observation notes and get

88
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,299
a porn site

89
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,470
and keep asking for money looks like you
know if you've seen top markets like a

90
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,370
lot this monster

91
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,790
350 every five minutes

92
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,919
I am it keeps going up it also is also
won the ones actually goes up your

93
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,400
Google account information what is a
Google account information

94
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,870
your Google Account good ties into your
Gmail ties into your I'll

95
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,889
with Flickr new I figure the David

96
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,490
Picasa possibly I forget exactly what
Google's a initiate

97
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,960
follies are gmail your your Google+
account

98
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,359
arm be with everything that can be
accessed by with a Google account

99
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,870
you're setting up an attacker I don't
begin text includes the bathroom not on

100
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,719
a person's certain

101
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:28,058
no not the possible does have been like
a unique identifiers which is useful

102
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:31,960
because they've is still my guess
however a large amount every five

103
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,580
minutes from you

104
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,349
few been put in say but I thought I paid
for them and by nearly forgot you came

105
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:38,229
again

106
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:41,300
mom in these are going to happen with
fraud on on phone

107
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,539
can you have your machine

108
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:48,498
over dumb enough to not pretend to be
something else to turn on/off tubing

109
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:52,210
could you not love you have an iPhone
comedienne you have ever gonna

110
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,198
propagation

111
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,490
supposed to be something it didn't quite
work a bit not there was a good game

112
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,229
didn't quite work out on you do it away

113
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:02,789
me tailgaters on a stolen handbook
people have done that occasionally

114
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:07,308
more likely be wearing pick up anything
because a lot of bad games other

115
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:12,659
not programmers were not immediately not
bad good in some certain cases though

116
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:16,889
dues bad programmers or mackey malicious
and they are just giving you a

117
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,849
sorta semi game that isn't quite there
I'll

118
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:24,219
much is going on we're coming for us is
a good look at the

119
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:27,909
in checking code I'll get back to the
point where where the applications are

120
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:28,558
actually

121
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,719
not not quite good be this is a

122
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,930
addicting code is gently when you have a
gym application to me it doesn't

123
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,719
properly

124
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:39,409
an entity Congress that would be a fun
outings is pure fraud

125
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:43,349
meaning just designed just for getting
information out of you

126
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,860
these were basically actual obligation
to do something that night

127
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,039
in this case a give USB for a running
through

128
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,529
very nice very useful app a relapse but
it has coded into it emotions got itself

129
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,209
isn't going to sting

130
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,249
I Mauer Android I believe its macabre

131
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:04,119
got a ezer file infecting virus

132
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:07,180
mother few 100 bucks to be the only one
hundred action

133
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,149
what is actually do YouTube wheelers
over X files that are Shia

134
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:15,879
searches your entire arms SD card for
all your your photographs everything

135
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,459
India

136
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:20,719
basic emigre be all your phone about
their and it basically stamp the picture

137
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:21,399
of the year

138
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,559
a.m. deceased I talk a meanie on

139
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:28,409
each year photos basically photo bombing
and all your family photos and fun

140
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:29,330
pictures and whatnot

141
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,479
with the title communing beautiful right
and didn't bomb it it's kinda buddy I

142
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,240
mean I think he does the code injection

143
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,209
it's mostly the poop do things are based
the old all class files from the

144
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,240
original lineup

145
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,379
%uh investor be up the majority the code

146
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,509
a small percentage does exactly just
listening

147
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,560
adding the ayatollah khamenei to your
your your legal

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,029
your photos everything we're photos kind
of annoying

149
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,919
it's also kinda buggy cuz I mean you
figure over the years people have

150
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,599
learned like I did last 20 years a
llamar

151
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,919
if you're suffering from Marseille at
ever

152
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,279
I guess a MS DOS or something it people
knew how to write or already factors you

153
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:08,529
know

154
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,999
you in fact the file you leave a marker
summers you can tell that the pumping

155
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:14,259
effectively don't we in fact over and
over again

156
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,789
it can go to bed shop here with this
where the FU

157
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,829
got went in and did something in the
active code like like such

158
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:25,019
we actually fight over the whole
according to NBC got the following in

159
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,839
this this function within the file
handle each individual with Gabe a file

160
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,789
it's damp together your original file
with the arm it was on the smaller one

161
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,149
it's down together this fall over here

162
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,479
on to whatever phone you have but they
don't need any with Mr Mark output it is

163
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,189
that what happened here original file so
that when they did it again

164
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,189
so we're end up doing is continuing
continue continually

165
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:51,420
stamping out his this is on top your
pictures and causing damage your files

166
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,839
an increase in the file size there are
multiple multiple times you both place

167
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:55,850
in SD card

168
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,240
and be keeping very noticeable I

169
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,899
what I don't know if so nervous though
unlike always knows whether

170
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,760
this enough and a diet or something he
titled I'm not sure

171
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,250
is an actual example with the looks like
you see original love me

172
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,550
image of %uh Flickr a big Creative
Commons article at no license says we

173
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,559
can modify do whatever you like we did

174
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:21,089
so we're at it in our inner Miller's he
wouldn't elaborate we know kinda what

175
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:21,970
happens but no

176
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,790
basic title for a bomb the bomb and then
because you can check the file

177
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,760
he still does it and will you endorse
the back on its getting lighter in my

178
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,120
delight or not that's good

179
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,389
am this follows the first impression
this is somewhere in the third or fourth

180
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,430
this is sir 56 summer further on

181
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,359
by this time and the fourth one it's now
before time flies

182
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,769
and it's starting to fade away your acct
Obama gonna disappear from a missile

183
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:50,799
like that seem to bring back a future
where money is disappearing kisses

184
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,309
these guys are going to get okay real
reference okay but nom

185
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:57,549
the point is he ate

186
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:01,790
disbelief anybody they are still really
well cuz it's a fresh copy every time

187
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,069
but the original pocketed more more
damage than you see losing a loved this

188
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:05,679
place

189
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,329
it's kinda kicking it is thank you
because it is

190
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:12,989
the kinda money that use ticket pictures
guy in a bit when your photos

191
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,730
but I mean it's it's it's gonna be
retained because they didn't do it right

192
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,299
they didn't figure out how to make sure
they're not continue infecting

193
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,600
'em

194
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,850
where am I going with that but you could
be another at Notre basically are

195
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,829
recording audio

196
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:31,459
recording are you on on on on mom

197
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:35,229
from the your phone device been with
numbness not by the top but I don't how

198
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,269
that's because you don't have that phone
audio

199
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,549
are getting permission for them this is
the

200
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:44,170
becoming more and more common it's
basically you recording two things one

201
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,040
is that the team after touchdown to
YouTube on your phone like a

202
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,510
your PIN numbers your credit card
numbers are things like not

203
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,839
om we've seen that initial use only like
in an

204
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,819
no busy approve a concert academic
happen and inspire where

205
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:01,890
so back to the potential I programs

206
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,480
they're not really wanted their spyware
we've seen all over the place

207
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,939
but known to be seen in malware people
are really attacking your phone is in

208
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:11,230
Ocala goblet Leo

209
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,670
and he's not back in general the first
academic programs that came out more

210
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,729
deserts and commerce online everything
the other trademark issue

211
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,149
it because some colour art thou colmer
up

212
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:25,839
basically listen for the audio from your
phone it had like a database uva

213
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,730
all those good I P R Diack invoices
pont's you know where you press 12 TD

214
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,750
see what movie Days Inn best to talk to
a live person or

215
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,490
well your credit card company dial them
up and say okay I've gotta pay my bill

216
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,819
what number i press archive poem I got
it I what number i press all those

217
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:41,469
things

218
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,839
the other day to be slick a handful a
credit card companies were

219
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,140
a good number there anyway that they
weren't looking and national said

220
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,779
and allow them to say okay we know we're
the ER

221
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,029
I V our system can ask you to please the
say or press your your credit card

222
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:56,870
number in

223
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,140
and they describe this small thing a
body 0 and it basically a

224
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,500
voice recognition or audio recognition
on for you or your digits like you're

225
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,610
sitting at a number

226
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,209
for credit card you're speaking over
Mount it crackles 129 tickets so

227
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:15,309
dish 129 in your 16 digit and they just
sent out

228
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,980
know it very few permissions back to the
attacker very nice technique very

229
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,199
annoying

230
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,279
it took about an alarm going to go in an
hour with some generate about

231
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,130
I guess August the same year so called
at about seven months

232
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,319
the lower half a year a long time
consumers are basically open source ID

233
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,019
is how 38 Android

234
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,990
I'll UPC look at the editor Java API for
ongoing say okay

235
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,610
what can you get no can do sorry we're
gonna grab information here

236
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,829
what what do you guys I need to go to
you record audio

237
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:50,329
I'm it's there exists it took 78 months
which is funny because the

238
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:53,439
Matheny we going to do this would be
willing to make some money off this

239
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,899
drive slow the traffic like with the
five naps earlier

240
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,689
in like with the are injecting a code is
almost nothing ago that pic you make

241
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:01,769
anybody any money

242
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,769
it has made the ayatollah infielder
photos I'll

243
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:09,839
the actual Mauro does this thorough 20
them basically enjoyed mixed by an

244
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,899
Android Golden Eagle

245
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,269
nigga spy got some coverage a couple
months ago for a month or two ago when a

246
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:18,939
I O security companies I like they're
gonna buy one offer from

247
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:23,589
by some exploits of a bomb the open
market a black market perhaps in the

248
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:24,600
next point

249
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,480
it's been about 14 grand worth the time
and money to my next point

250
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,010
%uh did basically silently installed in
a good spot on a bunch of old place

251
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,779
forget the name the company om

252
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,679
summer the racks colleagues I forget
exactly what was behind who they were

253
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,699
um but they had a sort of them I am

254
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:44,839
a list of press releases but apparently
they were able to tho like a spot on the

255
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,500
phone and record on him

256
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,089
and recording audio is not busy
recording entire way we've already kinda

257
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:51,299
want to press on it because

258
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,889
one year on a mobile phone on Android
phone Android device

259
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:58,559
and it's some rare for similar to happen
to me that you take up so much space

260
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,980
unless you're doing

261
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,370
stepping out on top so many picture I'm
you really care about

262
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,699
spaces care about wasting an urgent care
about your data plan like most people

263
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,439
don't have unlimited data plan to

264
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:12,129
I now with the way it's going now we're
now in the US of A

265
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:15,519
almost none of us are getting a new
phone getting an unlimited plan

266
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,360
haha so it didn't need it needn't be
whose YouTube AC compressor file so mr.

267
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,259
the compressed audio on a file

268
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:24,680
and it's a design for a mobile format
allows you to

269
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,930
exports more Monday to is going to have
a picture here why plan works well

270
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,739
they lose by the days are getting number
it should be pretty close together

271
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,089
it serves a purpose that the attack was
able to get know you want to

272
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,860
record audio steal credit card numbers
and pin numbers & trade secrets if it's

273
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,329
not the conversation

274
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:45,998
at 10:30 a.m. or not you can bring it
into like digits like the

275
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:49,089
learn the proven Nassau comatose there
are

276
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,249
they were able to gather more
information like Gianna stock tips

277
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:54,259
things like not

278
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:57,540
I'll secrets are over whatever early
deals mauna

279
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,459
things like not another nice trick and
I'll know either using are on our

280
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:03,430
updates

281
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,589
to personal this one is the year update
I guess you look at it this way are

282
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,589
I could be fake %uh people you pretend
to be a legitimate application

283
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,689
like a legitimate Android lemme

284
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,689
and looted accumulated legitimate
Android

285
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:20,399
system a bit like okay you're a virgin
well %uh three or whatever you like your

286
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,069
what name

287
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:25,050
the code name for this it's its up my
mind because all like food in mind on an

288
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,248
ice cream in

289
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:30,160
Ice Cream Sandwich gingerbread and I
don't know

290
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,160
moderation is I'll basically you will
you do is pretend to be an update

291
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,009
because both people say when we come out
they want to pick up the over-the-air

292
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,319
answer

293
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:42,889
how year after I want you to their
phones

294
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:46,529
looking at but good personalities or
chose not to the brew their phones

295
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,889
I mean what you get from your phone you
can access to a new firmware is bob is a

296
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,230
cure for my eyes

297
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,360
I like earlier with that knowledge to
call

298
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,680
not go with a call right not color idea
was a carrier IQ

299
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,469
which is basically installed on devices
by the year manufacture

300
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,259
already own carry ahead of time deal
base to go statistics from

301
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,279
-ism individual users but it woulda

302
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,009
it was very difficult to remove it was
because in solar system application you

303
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:14,970
couldn't

304
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,779
removed from a phone that you had access
so you basically up to reduce acute on

305
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,459
your phone

306
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:24,050
to clean up your phone because it it was
somewhat accessible and it did because I

307
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,219
believe information

308
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,139
om over the Internet via I guess easy
accessible from a.m.

309
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:33,550
easily accessible applications which is
also commenting on Android

310
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,550
'em in the case %uh v

311
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,529
pick mello be using Google I want to get
rid of something like that what I do

312
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,730
well I'll tell you but it seems
reasonable

313
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,139
I can't wait for the over-the-air update
on the I'm gonna go and do it so it's

314
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,569
actually quite a bit we've seen a bunch
of different nothing to dent nom

315
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:52,118
P so now we do that their questions all
packages it's a system update

316
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:56,059
because no one in its all packages right
and not so much

317
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:00,100
up and then we'll also how those are the
fake updates which are not nice but the

318
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,019
real nice ones or the ones that will do

319
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,059
updating a themselves now with an update
itself because they want to add new

320
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,770
functionality okay

321
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,490
we've seen on the speaking thing it's
useful to watch TV we can add new X

322
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,500
would get more much like okay

323
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,230
we still love boat with the voice calls
invoice information

324
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,610
now let's deal like their emails or
something like that field earlier text

325
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,550
messages

326
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,888
or proper still have their credit card
information is available

327
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:28,030
up to what the room our update something
not nice because the

328
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,668
even the bag is beyond okay we got
apocryphal sometime got more things more

329
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:32,379
features

330
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:36,408
it's not been a personal girls like
click buy books every five minutes

331
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:40,550
and and the key is that once you've got
an update and in a basis to manually in

332
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,760
accessing a good connection

333
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,119
why would you want the victim to know
that you're a business owner improving

334
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,959
things and bypass the security or
whatever else

335
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
why would you want them nobody wants to
so they did pretending not to be visual

336
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,770
because the only permission because
you're gonna get permission saddam

337
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,389
they're gonna get the installs selling
kinda permission is all packages

338
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:03,408
to do this is silently very tricky
better

339
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:07,760
little harder protect been receiving is
dummies are already infected that

340
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,070
doesn't mean you're gonna get phone
installed by a drive-by installs

341
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,809
what we see on the PCR time we're okay
you busy one website you get hit

342
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,780
articles with unit on an iPhone where
you have like jailbreaking dot com

343
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,570
we have the you visit your baby doc
comin they have a a jailbreak exploit

344
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,020
with another chain expert to reduce
security to and disable coating and so

345
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,540
forth

346
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,200
to get you basically a similar kinda
root access on your phone

347
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,879
the job a cactus tearful as you can that
at the Muslims don't love you want on it

348
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,158
got to blow by Tom readers going click
on and we still don't have not

349
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,399
the best we have a sound installs and

350
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:45,750
and its and once installed actually
that's where they get you

351
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,919
forget the sums of work once the iraqi
on your phone on your device

352
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,190
they've got four lakh issue they've
gotten everything they need you meeting

353
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,520
together

354
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
of the film islet took a look at some

355
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,639
academics on the these are all welcome
things you know with abuse the slide 10

356
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,649
all went in things we see out there
already

357
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:07,969
%ah but they got a mention about some
calmer

358
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,879
odd basically a a malware that does the
records audio from your fault right

359
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:17,020
my concept took a mere six to seven
months actual unreal our

360
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,520
we know we have to meet a little bit
newer negative academia

361
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,908
it's kinda funny i mean academic
community cutie to the Tiki think okay

362
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:28,770
how if you got what it has been touched
in a phone up we build a minister to

363
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,408
give us more information on any any
place or not

364
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:35,350
om what's going to be okay how we do
things like

365
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,899
gotta know how do we read your keyboard
which is another want to sing before

366
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:41,939
like in a nap call touch longer

367
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,860
touch locker wherever I think I should
know before is are basically two

368
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,119
applications one is the %ah

369
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,119
the bar you install exceeds the cleaning
a it be sweeeeet

370
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,220
records data from your from sensors
attacks or %ah Missy

371
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,030
when you you touch your phone yeah
obviously you'll affect X or a little

372
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,020
bit

373
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,750
and those little variations in and
perturbations become

374
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,309
it baby basically that with the years to
get much better say the 129 okay you got

375
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,350
here that the one you picked over there
that

376
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,399
me and so for the record all those good

377
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:16,379
overtime all a very secure position

378
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:20,290
positions and then decide okay that's
what were your

379
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,379
then that data is going to a database
help identify

380
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:26,678
way you touch it causes they did not
work is the

381
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,200
title texan when you push a button or
whatever you do when you enter your PIN

382
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,629
number

383
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:34,360
in court on a that was two different
applications that was about

384
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:40,240
no Butler top floor is a new hearing
from a difference in our different team

385
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,460
they decide put everything into one in
one application basically this one

386
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,270
application

387
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,379
what it is competition i'm back to the
yard the project up like

388
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:51,899
game they're not that great like saying
I can't imagine game where you're

389
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:55,250
supposed to match the resulting in a
couple having a sheep

390
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,320
the maybe she'd maybe a little cutie so
you're putting your little cattle sheep

391
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,760
or not

392
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,530
%uh internationally you not a suburb on
screen also

393
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,559
mom is from the actual paper or not om

394
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,020
the that these icons are exactly the
same position as the numbers

395
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,080
so you're matching this one this one in
or near it will use both be pushing

396
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,158
you much into icons in the new roughly
where you are sick

397
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,659
this is one happy going to be a game
tend to be out in a while

398
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,780
like Angry Birds but not as in useful
because it's a lot of the winning the

399
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,480
bird

400
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,619
something simple like this something bad
you might have tried

401
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:33,918
so I guess what I'm saying is a

402
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,129
be very very wary about up their simple
one of my

403
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,270
much as possible what you want a good
reviews one look at things and

404
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,470
than they have in the play and play
market will be seen on the field on the

405
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,570
first before she got right now

406
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,369
arm because things like this happen this
app is a little bigger than our problem

407
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,799
because i jst training data and
recording

408
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,668
about the sample vid yet from the from
the researchers bill leeson

409
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,280
I believe in a few months I'll basically

410
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,460
one Halfpenny opposite launches and it
doesn't game to record where you're

411
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,220
punching

412
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,790
in two weeks until the a screen like the
unlock screen pops up in 10

413
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,090
oh okay put in your pure your unlock
only deported

414
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,199
I've added 16 digits doesn't matter we
regard to get away pushing

415
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,700
they be the same Centers Inc Salaam earl
or not it is OK it may be

416
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,700
so much in unit of area that's the best
to not reply can you type in

417
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,110
4432 whatever that's your online number

418
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,780
like and pick it up very nice technique
very good for stealing a buchanan is

419
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,290
very good for stealing our credit cards

420
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,210
I'll the other PC should success reading
did some legal different

421
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,810
same can't deal with XO remember but
without the Tom

422
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,790
if you'll you'll notice when you type on
the on the soft keyboard with the actual

423
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,060
letters

424
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,908
name YouTube it like 26-30 letters on
screen or

425
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,639
keys on screen you can touch and type
them or not accessing

426
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:55,379
you'd be the same mom the same slur on
reading

427
00:22:55,379 --> 00:22:58,800
roughly same sensor many different
meetings to be able to tell where you

428
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,490
were touching on some keyboard

429
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,589
which is the bigger problem and
different accuracy in an alarm or

430
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,250
complications

431
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,790
international numbers in the easier and
also slightly different obligation

432
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,570
basically toploader does it all in one
one piece one simple out

433
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,099
something like that and told me better
than that fake think they are already

434
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:18,678
modified iranian food

435
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,210
with the year ayatollah coming on board
slight different is

436
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,010
you lose money here they used to
dispense

437
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,000
that's what I got mom use the second
picture how it actually works

438
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,129
the one out basically you got two pieces
works in different modes so into one

439
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:35,959
point it's learning a new console app

440
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,599
its ok to learn what you doing we're
playing a game in Thursday tinted okay

441
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,099
now you

442
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:44,520
in the screen has an actual already gone
an actual a touchpad

443
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,129
and inserting something data eventually
send up although that information back

444
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:49,379
to the attacker

445
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:53,859
be rainy technique remember useful for
them a.m.

446
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:57,668
have pretty much not about her not to
attack mom

447
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,770
let's now look at I guess I'll talk
about our meeting exploits since

448
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,480
a lot of the people in this room how
true to their phones

449
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,710
one good thing one good thing com
attackers all actually you know

450
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,409
developing their own experts they're
using same it's what you're using your

451
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:12,079
phone's

452
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,658
all your phones on devices they're not
we see any effort to do

453
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,119
because it takes a whole yes and reached
base on a link but from yes you can find

454
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:23,470
dornin reuse exploits from mom

455
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:27,540
basically think essentially put them
over 22 up are living so make eighty six

456
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,609
innings

457
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:32,428
you can do it you know what you doing
that takes time but you gotta not over

458
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,849
much of an exploding unknown

459
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:38,129
understandable in the first place ill
you something with it

460
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:41,020
so what do we see an interview at the
actual numbers look at look at the deal

461
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,879
okay we've got

462
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:47,070
nom I'll the first 1i guess is that
appears unreliable person as for

463
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,859
are the new cabinet in Jamaica a body
colour day

464
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:54,449
exploit we did together 6.0 Fall Break

465
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,200
deciding the volume demand or what not
and there but eighteen different minor

466
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,280
minor variants

467
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,099
89 get their lazy attackers a lazy don't
really want to waste the time

468
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:08,079
horny also cheap because they don't
spend the money to develop their own

469
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,109
only purpose ago you can use to make
pick up money here and there

470
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:16,730
I am same thing next wouldn't know Chuck
she has like 20 62 invariant

471
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,599
on this is like a I think that you don't
exploit there were like twenty six minor

472
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,450
variance

473
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,280
but that's a whole lot I think the only
thing they change maybe we packing a bit

474
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,579
mary backing an expert itself is my
tribute to McMahon forget the exact

475
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:30,099
details

476
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:33,770
in our region to cater to you get what
very diverse numbers are also

477
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,040
be like them I guess three most common
ones out there any

478
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,270
for various editions allrounder like 2-3
in

479
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,929
three and so forth wanna and its
citizens

480
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:48,020
attleboro should do they not only
carrying a lot about what's in there and

481
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,980
it's very hard

482
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,089
this is going to go back to against
saddam

483
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:57,440
how many people are involved I guess in
putting together an individual

484
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,770
firmer look if you if your bank tomorrow
a phone yet have more or publish a TI

485
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,829
a former update if you got like a love
my guess

486
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,210
the because T Mobile has a bit more
effort on the network

487
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,369
for their people abandon funding for
stairs over-the-air taking a look faster

488
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:15,750
hombres im depends want to get on the
manufacture not just the

489
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,780
via a carrier so depending on who the
man factory phone is a CC is it now

490
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,970
were both GTE in one case are y'all
might have heard about the

491
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,740
the back to uncertainty TV phones at the
with

492
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,020
was MetroPCS or the other said you a
binary

493
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,990
on the on-device lucky to basically axis
the voting booth the phone

494
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,690
good morning because I mean didn't know
there was silence or two it is I'm easy

495
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,169
to

496
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:44,329
to install an update on the phone
finally he had like a possible with

497
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:47,389
Donnan been released pretty quickly so
it's like

498
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:51,820
you guys they left the back door her
phone gym to make things easier for you

499
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,460
other many factors and we're not even in
New Year care seeking solo PTZ oversold

500
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,859
Wyoming almost 2 trouble

501
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:03,829
do more than a little bit irritating com

502
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:07,530
anyway I'm once again for the same
reason I guess why we're in your phone's

503
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,639
to get rid of summers but whatever to
somebody that needs by owners are

504
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:14,500
Picasa or wrist and assault began with a
bit about you guys doing

505
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,730
they also want you to know that nice
things like security software things are

506
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,730
installing previously

507
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,480
like if your carrier said okay we're
going to be sent to your phone with

508
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,470
pre-installed to Ann Arbor Summer

509
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,190
when you do then if you're a bad guy you
root the phone and your move that and

510
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,169
you deleted of the essence the partition
same

511
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:33,429
by it goes away maybe they they get up
to you

512
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:36,550
mom then they can they can read your
phone really messes me

513
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,320
week information can be here I me I'm
things like that I mean

514
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,250
this doesn't mean though that you're in
any real danger from rooting your phone

515
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,879
any more than anything else

516
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:48,689
because basically an Android phone in
anger and it was very very open

517
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,550
likely I'll the PC before with the with
ms-dos in another person dos

518
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,270
wearing with a very open platform and
yes there was a lot of the information

519
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,440
available for the program and whatnot

520
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,740
and yes there was a lot on our other but
compare the actual legitimate operate

521
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,139
there like on the PC

522
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:09,879
was good long still a very very small
person who knows I may be a couple

523
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:10,879
percent here and there

524
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:15,149
community gun large government because
once again there is more money

525
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:18,969
it when there's like a pretty much the
entire hungrily has the largest some

526
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,839
mcguinness times um

527
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,280
their decision to ponder also has the
most to deny coverage in a landmark

528
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,609
so it's also the biggest target because
almost every word as to go after

529
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:34,129
ass and gets bigger and I see it more
popular hits our laptops and and now

530
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,310
tablets a lot of tablets are a lot of my
mobile phones

531
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,168
it becomes more and more for threat
saigon

532
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:41,630
on

533
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,559
rhythm

534
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,020
yet so be it basically as as it now and
are getting more and more me on

535
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,580
established platform or even other
others marveled level become established

536
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,790
no whoever gets the larks the I guess

537
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:02,820
market share becomes a large target
people continue go

538
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,260
as the money money will keep you coming
in for on robbing stealing money from

539
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,629
people stealing our

540
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,309
account information people Aston
accident data when I think so be

541
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:14,629
mentioned to me earlier was at phnom

542
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,059
people are you seeing mobile devices for
as

543
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,240
basically tiny botnets for computing
power

544
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,760
like if you working like I collected
baby version norming this in the younger

545
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,750
cousin version out

546
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,770
stealing somebody's keep you to mind
becomes not as much power available on

547
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,150
mobile phones timing is

548
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,429
you're going to be more expensive I mean
been getting an iPhone relatively

549
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:37,100
cheaply

550
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,100
ombre you want to meet with a quad-core
singing on capitol line is because your

551
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,760
whole much money in front so looks like
the BC I don't know in in China one hour

552
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,330
we see most attacks coming up for job
mind he recent

553
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:56,330
b2b basically you're when you call and
steal a little from a lot of people

554
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,500
pretty much you get invective million
users and you feel like going car

555
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,670
one dollar for me to them you've got a
million dollars still from firing

556
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,600
thousand getting more reason to work
harder

557
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,669
and in the case of Vegas the China
you're doing a lot more lot more people

558
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:16,530
lot more over market in a case in
america real solo member found Psalm

559
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,820
and Publix and wal-mart on it depends
because we have so many other markets in

560
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,409
in

561
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,630
other countries where you have for all
you get a localized marketing meaning a

562
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,170
market has nothing to localize in your
language

563
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,410
unita Tom you're more like to go after
them then you are

564
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,120
in america where we have a see the play
market or the one that's provided by %ah

565
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,270
your local carrier look at. a rising
market or something

566
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,270
you're less likely to go outside India
Michael walled garden

567
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,400
to go after individual obligation to
mass

568
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,410
I you're looking at 90 you've been
through your phone is it okay I'm done

569
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,950
with going just one place I want my
Steam you

570
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:56,210
it's rare so did it's less likely to
come out you for that or

571
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,429
be able to get get you in general and
also as long as you stick with the

572
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:05,210
application have good good no reviews
and tend to be down by a lot of people

573
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,400
that 10 think twenty coverage but nom

574
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,380
also if you have a Google saw bouncers
offered us a

575
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,840
they're basically monitor for %ah the
Android Market for submission to the

576
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,309
Android Market I am didn't see any real
details on except for what's out there

577
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:25,178
looks like basically day they scan the
application they look for permission for

578
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:26,789
us to have a place to look for for

579
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:30,980
code like like anniversary look because
it battle-ready on the look for things

580
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,260
and that could be trouble

581
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,990
minted slightly built in 2001 arm or

582
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,860
up was in with your sign a bubble has
more shit system protection in place

583
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,340
i in the case about I believe there's a
talk coming up at Black Hat

584
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,189
going any captured coming in the Google
Play market

585
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,100
that is doing some suspicious activity
that is stealing information or

586
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,709
leaking information on and is put up
their buyer researcher

587
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,510
so the literally military please only
count their his own name

588
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,600
but it's it's something similar to that
we're in it

589
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,219
it today lead you to be looking up maybe
like the icon playing out maybe

590
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,919
something else I'm not sure what it is
yet

591
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,180
we'll all find out in

592
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,550
I'm sometime in July you know lately
July we'll all find out and when the

593
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,149
action announced publicly when it is

594
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,210
I'll but they basically min

595
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,830
the they can still be bypassed other
security and

596
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,000
your stall we still gon be better off
going after things that have

597
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,310
good reputations that sucks you look at
them on the counter-attack

598
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:33,340
it's actually want a more complicated
tax out there that we've seen on nom

599
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,530
on the PC side aren't sure if I
polymorphism

600
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,850
base in the same thing in DC on on the
on the PC where

601
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,120
every time you go to his website maybe
your every time a computer with the

602
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,340
website a new computer

603
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,570
they gonna do in individual customized
version up now

604
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,080
'em our I'm in this case it may seem are
fine for the

605
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,250
a text file so today it didn't break any
I'm simple and my signature

606
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,000
on it look slightly different it's about
team functionally maybe to recompile

607
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,730
basically everybody with get a new
version on the PC side is not a

608
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,030
protection where they say okay

609
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,210
arm the attacker will have like okay tom

610
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,100
we've got like a donnell say the as you
sow dollar wanna

611
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,429
a bonnet dying claimed on order and it
tells you okay

612
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:20,350
I you installed on and and each
different IP address gets a diversion or

613
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,649
the same person every time

614
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,080
so you can get all other versions you
can't do is say look if you're an

615
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,639
american you can get all the ATM

616
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,540
all example unless you have likes a big
access point or two but I peter is

617
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,100
already setup members is now will have
to find things like that

618
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,939
mean like a melodic machine at your
disposal I came on i guess im incense

619
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:46,070
it it's very very good year by passing
out so you basing build a custom burger

620
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,000
every person

621
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,370
on Android its recent and very similar
least not one major famine has

622
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:56,169
we've got like I believe 25 different
directions that the number was gonna

623
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,980
25 different individual texan's for
minor variations on

624
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,140
minor variations and we have somewhat
unique not discharging Eric signatures

625
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,860
for the year

626
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,929
application were it's basically a Street
four-color coach in Mad Men

627
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:12,960
pretend to be an insulation program it
really is something else entirely

628
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,010
is a.m. could be fake on it it says it
on it so I know I got shut up or

629
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,700
something

630
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,810
something along those lines and it is
not bad at all

631
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,159
and changes are done automatically
making

632
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:31,678
what up

633
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,089
home 30 so we have prematurity a case
the whole time apparently I forget the

634
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:37,078
exact number one

635
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,619
there's a few hundred samples you
checked already just what the

636
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,829
the small nothing is out there but
basically you take a standard

637
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,960
a pic a file month played the internal
custom text file

638
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,190
like changing strings or something to
Nick last name and you release

639
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,280
you can you buy today by the hour by
whenever time

640
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,329
former you want it is the world a more

641
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:01,230
it sounds very faint if your gonna
findings on for each done but it's

642
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,430
really simple

643
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,109
you could be destroyed like a simple
approach might ask up to basically

644
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:08,509
change text in the source code and then

645
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,210
run your tools to build you a became
send out sign didn't send out to you

646
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,819
to new people is kinda nice and kind of
interesting

647
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:19,859
but not to leave fancy but it sounds
been in the service I polymorphism

648
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,290
ninety change every single version
London you like

649
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,700
the concept simple the thing is it to do
6:30 mormonism

650
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,770
an efficient activation for like I
University action

651
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,440
which doesn't really work it things they
don't really change functionality we can

652
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,079
basically take on with them

653
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,490
but the function or in general with
possible we can take on on

654
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,509
very minor changes they do like gonna in
a sense strings I mean

655
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,299
their mobile way to be texting someone
isn't there was a was a teen mother

656
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:52,619
does been disbarred dynamic a person who
if you feel like you're going to leave

657
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,089
I'll deal nice product for for PC an
hour that did not make detection for %ah

658
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,140
Mauer house as there is a network a
texan

659
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,270
so evening like a a private
signature-based of love

660
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,480
the same our like 10 different day uses
gonna individuals think because

661
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,520
you're basically a have a large against
saddam

662
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,720
on to Turkey space not exactly evil or
large species the

663
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,868
basically it take on and NBC things you
can find on your own

664
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:25,470
so it's possible do without so it is a
nice controversy get now in in phnom

665
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,730
in an hour people keep trying to be made

666
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,880
the detection and we've seen where they
would attack a

667
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,480
their neon so I never saw him so other
things the meaning of securities

668
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,760
offerings okay we're going to cuba is a
first

669
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,020
in this case they're gonna do like what
joe Manchin where basic you doesn't

670
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,759
modify your your your binary into my
kind of people

671
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,829
me how to be a week or two to avoided

672
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,230
or in the case of people like you're
walking down in the apt to Mike

673
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,280
you can if it's Oreo build on the public
side mean you put on a public market

674
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,049
departing market everyone going down i
think im

675
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,329
because available and of course a
million dollars so you're you're

676
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:04,520
the window of a I guess what's accounted
for

677
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:10,170
mom sorry

678
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,610
opportunity camp you're popular window
is closing its source or

679
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,680
amenable to Billy still I guess the
person because

680
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,560
you were going out that you think is
good was not I believe the the deed like

681
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,790
to use love

682
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,330
public games like to cut the rope or I
guess so

683
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,319
Angry Birds so things like that to me if
you're if you're getting a popular

684
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,850
application from something that's not
the actual market

685
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,150
the actual play marker one you're better
off not touching

686
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,380
maybe it's not look at Amazon market or
something else and a check

687
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,760
don't go out for devoted entirely on

688
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,810
I think you're going to have to
acknowledge and for the year as you are

689
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:50,850
chuan bi and central drew for a on the
back on top longer

690
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,569
which is an app that does the detection
and

691
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,520
record if things them dog do you have
any questions on any of these

692
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,650
fixer home

693
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,890
it in an hour or an hour or anything in
general

694
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,170
consent so love you have advanced you'll
feel secure in general

695
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,430
how many people accuse good I just wanna
know

696
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,990
on really really secure could give you
very busy did all the source code on

697
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,580
your phone

698
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,020
hmm you know exactly what's on their you
don knapp your territory

699
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:26,240
look at it in know them well whether to
your turkey pretty good

700
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,430
people to keep 3 good home

701
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,609
yes yeah okay sir questions are we going
to get more

702
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,880
or bottom analysis tools you mention nom
backup

703
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,690
you can't individually boxed million
that you have you seen nom

704
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:48,060
degrade om I believe that's the a.m

705
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,390
that's the it basically is a VM that
implemented so it'll tell you all you

706
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,609
very sleepy a cold

707
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:57,670
but I called love you run to face in
this middle published a mass at a pub

708
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,520
today to send you will see what it does

709
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,520
other things like not touch including
the art museum

710
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,550
the honey net projects are I'll

711
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:13,350
Eren universe in June 9 p.m. at about
nine gigabyte uncompressed Senate's

712
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,080
and counting up it is actually not at
the start so that's a good seed

713
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,130
IBM the area said if you Google honey
nan

714
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,960
and Erev M you should find an
interesting environment

715
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,880
and else other than a good thing a
Google product reviews up the code as

716
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,660
the name

717
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,509
fix things in the DMZ always have the
updated tumbles I'll

718
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,070
basically a on amino acid I should be
done by a number of different people at

719
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,550
the Madame I think com

720
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,960
a lot of good randomized comparison on I
don't miss because the

721
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,590
it's a pain in the butt to deal with
thousands apples were things like the

722
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,880
tour is I polymorphism

723
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,170
gether lot a summer summer we don't
wanna waste of time

724
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,190
look at every single one is the using
backs Mali on think you're using it BK

725
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,760
tool to basement airport look at all the
code

726
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,330
we like to say okay we see all these
thing before can we

727
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,900
just not come up quickly I we're gonna
see more MORE not come out I'm not

728
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,370
further

729
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,770
I get to do you see other commercial
tools available on the market

730
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:15,000
home

731
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,530
I create the right now it is a very very
very individual you work with each

732
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,870
individual to litem

733
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,370
big pain in the butt to do in general
his you have to be skipped on yourself

734
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,060
in your angel in the UK allies

735
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,509
log in on half an hour after the fact it
would be nice we have a lot more

736
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,030
integrated tools I mean I like Google
doctor technique it bobby is that their

737
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,350
company making on a mission

738
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,610
I'll a number my mom other other
endeavors comes up on the automation in

739
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,060
general to handle the global

740
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,830
done samples coming in because its very
easy making it now coach in

741
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,110
reasoning Android malware so it's like
%um

742
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:53,740
there things out there for anecdote into
private sector taken as long you you may

743
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,490
raise a good point

744
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:58,339
why do we not have a whole lot of choice
in automated the reverse engineering

745
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,390
I'm surprised myself I know I don't have
the ballot for allied

746
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,859
my team is working on stuff like on a
lot of my colleagues or nothing for them

747
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,140
but we don't have been all

748
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,629
out there we figure after between what
four years five years

749
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,780
and with another you figure someone
would have designed an already and put

750
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,540
on the market and Michael I can either
pro or something like that you know

751
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,440
you're signed on XO their tools like ben
dover one on

752
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,560
things like nine we figured to be small
niche players who really something like

753
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,240
that and we haven't seen a

754
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,020
mentioning all anywhere yet hopefully
we'll see that this year now the

755
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,780
like it if you look at it like not
talkin are many as you can see it online

756
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,530
later on

757
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,390
about bypassing downstream there's going
to be called for

758
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,460
for more these advanced home on a
minimalist

759
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,680
to get rid of the people bomb mean you
have to be big help you build a big team

760
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,660
for you to do your cell

761
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,680
meaning by buys into a legacy get it out
there sure

762
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:59,680
them

763
00:42:01,509 --> 00:42:05,560
mom

764
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,038
them

765
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,499
High Commissioner article where you if
you take the two top anti-virus

766
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:16,759
programs for Android combine detection
was assaulted sixty percent

767
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:21,089
I'm not because I'm 75 person

768
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:25,140
lesson from the fibers not familiar with
our collections of be back to combine

769
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:30,368
not individually I'm okay mom

770
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:33,910
bags are sixty-five this little bit
better than 50 percent

771
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:38,390
listed recorders are I think probably be
once again because the way the Android

772
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,788
works in general it's a very open market
likened

773
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:44,710
on the PC side where not always have all
samples is low

774
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,779
well there's some overlap it a lot of
disparity between what the actual

775
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:49,609
samples or

776
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,869
and there's a a a sample sharing they
are simple sharing between love

777
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:57,269
an hour companies are we shared ample
time to get them so weird

778
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:01,848
and there are are are dog or turkey
share more information a lot of us have

779
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:02,819
a long morning

780
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:06,869
coverage mean now be nice to happen it's
not there yet

781
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:10,430
it work it or just like for the
automation the mission om

782
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,839
done a lot of the year the Vipers will
be improving

783
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,859
manual sewing questions

784
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:21,540
them

785
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,550
