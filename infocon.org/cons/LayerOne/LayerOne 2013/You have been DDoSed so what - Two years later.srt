00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,719
okay cool okay so

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,980
usual disclaimer

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,019
all you the opinions expressed herein
Mumbai might

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,648
a I'm not the PSI might an employer
which is fairly large

7
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,769
had given their so scanning make

8
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,078
sure that thats warns that arm

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,360
and I actually will not be pushing any
harder or anything so

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,750
just relax I am I would like to

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,140
kind of ego first who you are I'll and
I'm

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,190
what experience do you have been
beginning to doze tax

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,360
has any might have been doing that for
living or

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,360
having being everything Wong K

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,890
and prop okay and so

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,150
I don't see what offense I guess inner
in all cases

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,069
if you have any questions during that
time don't hesitate to interrupt me and

18
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,829
I just asked the question and

19
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:10,089
out that the content as much as I can I
am

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,049
so how does this stalker let my penis
stockwell

21
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:17,469
technically doesn't like an idiot but
though only about five percent

22
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,939
it'll be overlap with what but I wanted
to cover in the previous one I'll

23
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,339
and up unlike the previous talk this one
is going to be focused

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,340
on on a particular topic on Australian
Nadal

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,689
a set of problems that they're really
kinda causing a lot of trouble or over

26
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,189
the Internet over the last six months

27
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,999
a maybe even a year the biggest focus
very very

28
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,199
a wide range covering a lot of
technology so what about tax

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,670
this phone will be mostly focused on DNS
resource because this is what clinton is

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,979
causing a lot of problems

31
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,520
arm and we need a lot of visibility we
kinda

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,589
have to start working together on the
sewing solve those issues

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,859
arm K

34
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:03,469
so that's pretty much what we're going
to cover today

35
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:06,568
arms jumping quickly over this one am

36
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,369
no what has changed over the last couple
of years I'll

37
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,350
we have not had the benefit of the
attacks has grown significantly

38
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,440
I also there's some new facts and
motivational get backers

39
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,190
and sounded to set has actually changed
one

40
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,480
arm sold again

41
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,980
as a as I mentioned there are a lot of
Open DNS resource and that's the very

42
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,269
very serious problem

43
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,830
I Yoox playing in a few minutes how many
of you know what

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,540
DNS Open DNS is over this okay

45
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,150
is everybody else shy or you don't know
okay cool

46
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,480
what isn't Open DNS is over okay

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,299
cool that's good I am because I have
something to tell you

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,790
that will be your okay I am

49
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,850
cell 2010 based on the album it a pic

50
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,140
every metric seaport the biggest attack
according to us about 100 gigabits per

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,660
second

52
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,010
this was only one their plans for a
single client account YouTube its

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,130
it did year get tax the maximum

54
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,720
size is about 40 to 50 gigabits so long

55
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,270
that was that was the test that point
now

56
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,370
how many of you are familiar with our
bird us Arbor networks

57
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,650
they're fairly large fairly watching Van
Doren

58
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,720
long did of mitigation they did design

59
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,109
out what it is designed to me to get you
know serious attacks so

60
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,330
they had 31 checkpoints and did it is
fairly representative

61
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,330
as to what is happening on the internet
this from using them as a source now

62
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:47,070
and how about this year well let's take
a look at this this is the same guy from

63
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,459
a second ago but it's a scaled-down
guess so but guess what is the maximum

64
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,930
a men would be so this year setting

65
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,590
okay 300 they had that is only about six
weeks ago

66
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,550
this was the attack against penthouse
I'll it hit the water

67
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,110
provide us up all clear was the walls
that took the brunt of it

68
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,430
I basil over 200 gigs I

69
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,450
also what are the providers that water
the getting with popular

70
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,858
soul said he watched portions of it and
or what does that mean

71
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,138
having if you look at my role are you
have

72
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,270
response to get that compete in the
density of fathers sisters

73
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,758
or per square inch up was a double or
something every 18 months

74
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,539
and people can approximate from there
that computing power rests on a lot of

75
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:38,240
other things

76
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,720
should doubling every 18 months for this
is more than that handles 18 months

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,860
we're having acted table increasing
about 24 months so

78
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,780
that's not good the saga why's that will
look at that

79
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,500
in a few yeah she slows down the road
but yeah we have the over two hundred

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,039
cubits

81
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,349
and this was only about six weeks ago
this is the beginning of the year

82
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm kinda cute is what we're going to
see by the end of the year or next year

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,130
I am sold

84
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,240
just jump back into motivation you to
quickly arm

85
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,300
want the new things all over the last
few years is that there is significant

86
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,660
amount of talking about nations these
being involved in the business

87
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,570
before that we share a lot of you know
kids trying to show off

88
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,889
you know they don't like each other high
school don't think their website is down

89
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,039
or in asia there was a lot of arm

90
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
kinda small shops trying to takeoff file
another

91
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
shops up online presence like even

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,859
stupid things like furniture shops but

93
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,120
not we we have talked about people

94
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,009
from but purse prosper said the
government's investing heavily

95
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,199
into I'm stuff that is actually focusing
on the now simply seeing

96
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,669
other countries banking systems so it's
kind of getting serious that

97
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,270
where looking at professionals nice
bonino Camino it's also people at the

98
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,150
fed to obtain

99
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,849
are and fairly consistent and the way
they approach things

100
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:01,889
up tools 10

101
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,900
things that these new over the last two
years is that I'll

102
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,270
there's a raisa content management
system compromises

103
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,380
so instead of them attacking small boxes

104
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,560
you know on doing people's homes

105
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,960
I did he have somewhat limited access to
bed with those people are going

106
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,609
after content management system me and
that their hopes that in fairly large

107
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,340
providers

108
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,169
we'd access to a water bed wit and those
machines are also fared be

109
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,320
I am powerful so they can send the water
packets per second

110
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,919
I am do you want basically can figure
out what that means you have

111
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,010
quick we have a large pipe you have
couple

112
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,010
very fast machines well you'll need to
manage

113
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,820
500 boxes a it when you know it people's
homes

114
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,000
which go on and off well when people go
to bed

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,570
you have the server that is guaranteed
to be online that people actually that

116
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,570
they're paid to make sure it is online

117
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,469
has or a banquet well a recipe for
disaster

118
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:04,289
on help water Open tennis is over so
there's

119
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,159
to taxing the one of them I is the
perceived other ones at Monica's for

120
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:09,029
something more miss

121
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,130
alternative I am and

122
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,389
I have several sites big picture so
sorry in just a second

123
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,669
up now just going back to the changes
will did not change

124
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,839
well you can have to look at

125
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,589
a denial of service attack is a and you
can't wait you get a lot of traffic

126
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:28,710
what do you do with this traffic or what
happens

127
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,169
if you have your website feature on CNN
you get off traffic that's not the

128
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,909
houses that but it feels like one
because you don't have enough bandwidth

129
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,449
to

130
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,690
to solicit and also your computing power
is not enough to too serious

131
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,120
so think I think this way I am

132
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,529
issue on the gas is back you just have
to be able to serious it faster than

133
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:52,150
then then what they can throw at you and
how

134
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,409
much equipment you want to invest how
much you know

135
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,740
by promise York investing your def SSD
depends on your

136
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,690
it depends pretty much on I am how much
you want to be able to take

137
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,759
and at what point you're going to see
you know it's okay for my site to be

138
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,270
down

139
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,789
just because I did not want invest the
million in hardware

140
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,339
be able to get this yeah that's business
question

141
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:16,639
but it's kind of good for you to
approach it in this way because

142
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,130
I'm when management comes and says hey
you know what I want to be able to

143
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,630
withstand that now serious attack

144
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,469
the first question is does them I'll
what level

145
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:28,880
I how much bandwidth what type of attack
I

146
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,919
f course they won't be really happy to
answer all those questions but you can't

147
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,140
have to give them an idea

148
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,250
I what they're looking at I am and how
much this will cost

149
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,458
is everything has its cost up you know
you may be able to withstand the hundred

150
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,119
cubits

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,250
but you really have to have the same
month if not this Sat but let s

152
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,620
and this is where a lot of them hum

153
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,970
cryptic various and this way she can

154
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,290
you can come benefit from being prepared
ahead of time in half

155
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,620
I am establish partnerships with
different I am

156
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,850
companies you can have you know peers
you can have also I

157
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,199
contracts with Tom providers like Paul
flair that they're going to actually

158
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,439
skip traffic for your

159
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:09,760
and I am it's very important for you to
cash if

160
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
some planning and you know know what
you're trying to withstand

161
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,180
know how much you want me to get
in-house and how much you want to throw

162
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,760
it your

163
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,230
I'm provider arm

164
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,640
kinda from look at this farm arm now

165
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,660
another question is

166
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,689
if you want to mitigate attacks in-house
I'll

167
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:35,360
how would you like to approach this you
want to be always on or do you want your

168
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,720
sock to be notified

169
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,740
and then they'd accept an action in your
step cleaning up

170
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,089
or do you just want if all the gear in
line

171
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,910
cleaning up and yet at at attacks as
they come and then it's at that point

172
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,240
something happens and then you really
direct traffic

173
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,459
either or Medicare into a human operator
up to your arm

174
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,819
provide their I am their good and bad
sides in either way

175
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:01,140
and if you will have an open it and look
at a

176
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,410
what's happening they can make better
judgment most of the time

177
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,300
I'll if you really need to forward the
traffic someone else

178
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,349
and but to be honest this is just

179
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,850
another element in the chain that can
fail I'm yeah

180
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,260
issue page the operators will take the
five minutes for them to be all mine

181
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,350
then they have to you'll spend immediate
bang investigating 5-10 minutes

182
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,029
then they start injecting it out or
redirecting Dennis another five minutes

183
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,100
for your doctor training it's already so

184
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,900
on think about those things

185
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,140
I'm as I mentioned it's kind of like
I'll

186
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,199
businesses and you have to decide what

187
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:46,000
its almost like an you trust REIT arm

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
you can invest certain amount of money
or you pay system

189
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,900
in your for your insurance provider and
then you get something in I

190
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,189
in the spa in as a result of this so

191
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,770
up if you just have a small investment
you'll be able to withstand

192
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,160
I you know smaller attacks if you invest
more

193
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,390
usually you and the being able to meet
to get larger attacks

194
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,150
okay so it's pretty much if you look at
it like this its you have a parliament

195
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,380
that the number of attackers or attacks
at the bottom

196
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,480
and this kind of gives you and kind of

197
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,540
want to give idea I am

198
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,939
what a for how many of them are and you
know that not many of them can

199
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:30,860
can create a text with the high
intensity and the guys in the corners

200
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,240
they can only create a text second level

201
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,410
so if we take these bar which is your
investment or it is it presented with

202
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,900
your investment and what you can
actually mitigate

203
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,209
up by drawing more resources you can
basically stopped moving this bar

204
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,040
up so depending on how much you want to
invest you will be managing your risk

205
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,529
I what you can on me to get yourself in
what you need

206
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,000
to either cents to provide their all it
was good for you

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,319
or you just be done um

208
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:03,050
so cats I think there's the you must
give the morning

209
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,400
after the talks on think from banning
for

210
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,850
and so let's look at the attacks and
that particular text here and looking at

211
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,120
this

212
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,360
a reflective and asthmatic so are

213
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,970
what is reflective attack up anybody

214
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:24,970
and look at the sites percent

215
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,309
were him for

216
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:31,819
yep so I'll basically think a bit

217
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:36,420
is using a proxy to deliver the blow you
do not send the package from your own

218
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,020
system

219
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,809
I'll or you may send something that the
shooting the proxy but then the party is

220
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:43,490
actually the one that you can get back
traffic 2d

221
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,199
I together party I am

222
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,800
no it there's several things that you
need in order for this to work you need

223
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,209
to have a protocol detection you all are
used to that

224
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:58,049
arm so

225
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:03,069
think let me see harm

226
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,160
yeah so so basically

227
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,219
if and I would like to attacks am

228
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,640
and if I don't want them to be able to
see that ending that

229
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,910
I can just send the datagram to you but
I can forge my address

230
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,689
and pretends to be same and then when
you respond you'll be hitting sack

231
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:25,490
now this is kind of you know I'll
labor's because for every day to go I

232
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,360
send you know get want to Sam

233
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,510
now if I can help you send multiple
datagrams in the response

234
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,610
to my datagram then I can actually have
an amplification effects on this is

235
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,130
about

236
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,140
disunity attacks to different protocols
alliances and different things

237
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,089
um guesses while the brokaw's that the
law for a loss for fairly bit

238
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,839
asymmetry S&P as well SNPs she can you
must begin multiplication factors

239
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,089
and to be can also be used but that in
no mood to petition

240
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,740
DCP how would you use TCP to do that

241
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:03,740
to deflection

242
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,440
so this is that this is a very good
adjust

243
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,160
soul I'm it's kinda like a scene attack
and

244
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,230
you're basically sending s impact to a
host

245
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,699
I'll or packet with the same seems like
said on you for check the source and

246
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,209
then this whole story spawned

247
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,300
to the victim I the sending traffic to
them it's not symmetric

248
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,979
but I it obscures the SDO original
source in the attack

249
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,810
have seen that couple of times i'd the
first time I say there's like

250
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,479
really why would you even bother but
apparently people like to do that just

251
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:34,870
to

252
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,709
kinda for and yeah

253
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:43,310
so you're going to send this eso if this
is your reflector this issue and this is

254
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,768
the

255
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:47,360
the victim you send a same packets we'd
is

256
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,759
to this guy with the source that this is
your victim and then they said

257
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,639
seen that this guy this guy yes it

258
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,610
the scenic is the the packet detection
attacks him and then she's got to

259
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,629
respond with base

260
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:03,709
to pack it back so up this is not going
to be very efficient

261
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,349
I'm I also think it's stupid but people
do it I am

262
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,959
just obscure themselves cuz if you're
going to try to secure yourself or you

263
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,439
some implication at least

264
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:16,120
so you can't get a bang for the buck
their I'll

265
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,199
I simply same story you can just send
the S&P packet

266
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,750
from force the source to go back to the
victim um

267
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,430
now the good thing about the S&P is that
I should be in general you cannot

268
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,089
respond question it was another recipe
that I just a few

269
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,350
exceptions and they're not exceptions
like for example you have

270
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,550
yeah I think the equity quests and
correspond with those actually two

271
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,279
different types

272
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,550
so um in I simply at least

273
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,290
will not create the the the response
traffic from the victim

274
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,969
to the reflector why is that important
low because the deflector will show

275
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,939
these backscatter

276
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:53,120
in the figure out or kiss somebody's
using as expected yeah and investors

277
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,670
shifting

278
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,079
I San Diego acid is hosting for

279
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,609
their works you basically said the same
packet scenic I

280
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,029
and then it you know with the scene for

281
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,350
in this is a Segway with the scene for
DD's the you want to

282
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,449
exhaust this wats that a host his

283
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,859
for incoming connections you actually
attacking that host

284
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,430
week a um a deflected I'll

285
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,099
dispute text you are actually not ranked
exhaust the

286
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,980
the reflectors ability to a response to

287
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,819
to respond to you incoming connections
you just using them sent back to suggest

288
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:29,219
somebody

289
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,139
so that's that's pretty much it okay

290
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,829
so amplification as already mentioned I
am for a

291
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:41,309
back to be a that to the effect you have
to have a protocol that is somewhat the

292
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,699
same ethic and the way that the

293
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:46,120
the day manage things I am and

294
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,149
let's look at an example we DNS because
this is what has been happening lately

295
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,959
now you're all going to see that they
have S&P always

296
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,569
in my slides here with DNS they're
exactly the same S&P has not been abused

297
00:16:58,569 --> 00:16:59,339
is widely

298
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,309
I but over the past two months here and
there has been a lot of opportunities

299
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:04,470
people mapping SNMP

300
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,059
its unclear to me if this is the
researchers

301
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:13,289
that term just want to see how many open
S&P host are there that can be used for

302
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,148
amplification or it is the bad guys
mapping the infrastructure so that when

303
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:20,879
we start doing something about DNS the
issues that using SNMP

304
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,549
to do the attack so that's kind of
interesting but keep that in mind

305
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,619
an S&P is going to be the next big one
song

306
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,750
into your DNS citizenship process you
have for Coast asking

307
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,460
or history there is good look calm and
then they were going to get my IP

308
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,000
address

309
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,450
right can look like this source

310
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,500
the author destination to destination
host response this happens over unit be

311
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
so there's no state

312
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,419
there and it's very in it is valid for
the protocol

313
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,130
now in some extended cases

314
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,740
use this particular silver doesn't know
the answer they're going to send some

315
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,679
other place to deal with silver studio
37 assists is cool and then they're

316
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,490
going to get the answer back to the
client

317
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,740
once they I am have the the

318
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,789
acid they're going to cash it for
certain amount of time that means that

319
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:10,899
to a minimum a minute they're going to
remember this essential

320
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:15,090
if you sent this question many many many
thanks they're not going to the boulder

321
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:20,049
the dual tuners or Cisco alt authorities
said was that means that it will not

322
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:20,730
even know

323
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,240
that there's something fishy going on if
somebody is using their name

324
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,960
as una tecnica I'll

325
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,929
so what is Jessica section let's look at
the same picture

326
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,860
but in this particular case our attack
in which is

327
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,510
111 then forges the source address

328
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,360
to the one with the victim soul

329
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,908
when I their lease over tttt response

330
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:50,549
the packet is going to hit the victim so
it's all good tonight

331
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:53,730
if we just do nom the fridge to the
previous query

332
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,000
no Cisco book called tool something else
section is

333
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,919
for the congress like to the longer than
the record is good if this will fit in

334
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:01,610
four bytes

335
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,870
what they can't actually all those will
be 64 byte frames

336
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,620
akers that the me know you can have on
the internet segment but that's another

337
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,889
story the point is that you have be much
you know

338
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:14,830
question and the same size answer now
let's look at this

339
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,960
what a fight to get any play any query
basically says give me

340
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,929
all the Jessicas for this particular
staying the PBS

341
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:26,380
way to you so here is actually and a
record clearly

342
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,210
and this is any which includes APA

343
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,130
text anything else you can think of
including a

344
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,799
pitching keys in a sec so

345
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:43,679
let's take a look at the example that's
what it would create disaster

346
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,860
I actually detected some of the stuff
but you can see

347
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,449
back 9 characters this my result with
like

348
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,059
2500 characters they will this possum

349
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,389
there a bigger place you can create this
was just a sample

350
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:01,449
the pic in this particular case will go
to the victim

351
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,480
so mean the yes yes yes and this is in
my lap sexually I'm not kidding anybody

352
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,010
this is going from my machine but the
point is that

353
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,429
if I if the attacker sends acquitting
good to release over

354
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:15,730
and I'm not specifying if its secrecy
for parties yet

355
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,549
I am and the the S is fairly watch
they're going to send it to the victim

356
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:22,559
and the victim is going to see this
traffic not think about sending this

357
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,629
quitting many many many many times

358
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,799
what happens in the victim

359
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,840
okay so this is how the reflection
amplification work

360
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,678
says the query sport a source like it
777

361
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,799
goes to the victim

362
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,760
okay I'll saw the question is why would
somebody

363
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,360
bother running and all on these over
okay so did

364
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,540
tall distinct cases wanted this could be
your business model

365
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,620
like Open DNS and Google Google DNS and
actually

366
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,889
an example where you can have it is over
open the source

367
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,658
in everybody can Paul point their
machines to them and I am

368
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:06,130
use them as DNS every six that amusing
contest severs

369
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,480
I am now also do toted name servers you
taken a superset the ones that

370
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,309
are your team a source of information
for a particular domain

371
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,540
does also need to be able to assert to
everyone on the internet

372
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,510
what the information psych think about
this is alternative names they were

373
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,679
only December most everything about the
Cisco the main

374
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,809
soul it's just to be potentially able to
answer questions about Cisco

375
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:34,830
anybody on the internet so it has to be
opened by definition

376
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,120
um and the third is an action a

377
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,229
you go on the abstract shine some light
is that

378
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,690
our people haven't some added that the
condition about DNS

379
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,950
this couple denies books arm

380
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,039
kick it slowly spreading the the key
categories

381
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,250
probably the one that's kinda like the
Bible in this area um

382
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,059
they'd is basically people need to be
aware what they're doing when they re

383
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,379
when they're putting their lease over

384
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,440
online especially when it's accessible
from the internet

385
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,200
I and is configured properly it's not
that difficult several stands out

386
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,780
I'll just show them in a few slides up
buddy really gotta be careful with that

387
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,440
because it's

388
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,840
and fairly serious now this

389
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,870
okay I'll how do you know if you're a
reflector

390
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,928
something we can cover the second ago
you're going to be seeing or

391
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:24,070
pricing in the actual traffic or other
kinds of anomalies

392
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,129
now if the victim decides to drop the
traffic nor of it or some other

393
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,429
way then you're not going to see that
but I am

394
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:34,840
the point is that the peace you so then
the Shearwater we're I simply traffic

395
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,689
coming to UT

396
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,270
saying you know Orton reachable or host
unreachable

397
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,760
well you most like to be are used in

398
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,860
a reflective attack I am in keeping in
mind

399
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,908
the year yes most likely DNS attack
before that

400
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:54,129
you know like two years ago important
thing or do other things but over the

401
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:54,959
past two years

402
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,050
dennis has been the the biggest actually
a particular group that we've been

403
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,119
looking at stuff

404
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,149
dispute about the in half years ago and

405
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:08,000
and now they're kinda that Prime

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,790
but unfortunately no this it is fairly
widely spread so it's not only

407
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,100
ending it's it's multiple actors some

408
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,899
okay mitigation so I'll I'll

409
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:24,178
their cup of thanks to look at here um

410
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,750
what to do in order to defend yourself
and what to do in order to defend

411
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,830
other people unlike most to the attacks
the details

412
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,649
texting have been looking at the past
this particular one

413
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:39,239
is slightly different why is that

414
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,790
well look at this defend urself

415
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,770
you can deploy anycast and you know you
can use some form of ideas equipment

416
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,119
or staffing provider which usually just
a lot of

417
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,770
it doesn't addition here in order to
defend the Internet from your cell

418
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,059
you can do all those other things and
mind you all those things actually

419
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:02,700
configuration changes which are fairly
simple to implement

420
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,020
so you have this great symmetry between
spending a lot of money to defend

421
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,090
yourself

422
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,879
or just spending just a little time

423
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:15,750
tall I am think the others from you
being a deflecting attacks

424
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,740
I am well this is not going to
immediately ship your bottom line

425
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,470
I just because there are a lot of other
people like you that they're probably

426
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,929
open the facts but

427
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,090
I yup spreading the word and working
with with the community on the resolving

428
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:28,720
those issues

429
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,869
action you will change things arm

430
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:35,649
and it has been several projects I the
seamy you've been gone for many years

431
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:38,678
incoming has been going on for about 7-8
years now

432
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:41,869
so they have been able to to to decrease
the number 12 on these over

433
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:42,899
significantly

434
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:46,820
it's just a matter of us having the
discussion is more openly

435
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,090
I and some that load

436
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,220
that's one of them %uh but they have to
open the source

437
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,750
is something else incoming yes a.m. so
there's a place of a project which is

438
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,760
different than what income anything

439
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,730
arm shitty depends on

440
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,580
you know what I have to look at your
place or procurement

441
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,678
you'll I'm

442
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,500
James here Yahoo's

443
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,980
yea you can do it from I'm not sure if

444
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,059
this one is owned by them or not and
then yep

445
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,178
on you

446
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:31,250
okay so that's the point the point is
that um

447
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,399
we really have to stop taking a look at
what more to put on

448
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,820
on the internet then what's connected to
the Internet and mister configuring our

449
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,070
own your sis

450
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,158
you know trying to just mitigate attacks
against us

451
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,540
um cell

452
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,360
as being at the point there

453
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,119
okay so up one of the

454
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,959
today missus either and I think the time
I have some

455
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,020
from my slides and I so love the way
station mitigate

456
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,540
I am attacks I am into to configure

457
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,600
you get properly if you need to run open
is over order authority

458
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,809
east or configure rate-limiting I am

459
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,840
so if somebody is ask you the same
question

460
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,299
repeatedly I multiple times a second

461
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:22,570
that's probably in Knowle need for them
to be doing that because

462
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,678
I the way DNS works is they should have
cashed

463
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,750
that Quaid e for the amount of ppl
specify Connecticut

464
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,369
and they should not be asking you that
that this question more than that it

465
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:33,869
twice

466
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:37,949
a minute twice or three times depending
on the on the he viewed on the

467
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,590
is over the library some of them fired
up several requests at the same time

468
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,658
I still if you configure rate-limiting
again

469
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:48,809
unity decrease the amount to which you
order a

470
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:52,030
reflect that you'll be deflected just a
few back it's in the beginning and get

471
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,510
back and then you kind of job everything
else

472
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,908
so if you see that a particular host
peacemaking ninety-five percent

473
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:03,059
of the requests to you it's kinda clear
that you would actually being used

474
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:06,168
is inflected attacking that particular
host

475
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:09,840
I'll so that's one of the ways you can
you get on your site

476
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,189
I edit limiting what seemed so it was
included came by and I believe is a

477
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,110
stand that

478
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,110
future a about every year ago before
that was a patch

479
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,149
I'm not quite sure maybe maybe it was
like 60 months ago but it stemmed

480
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:27,020
I just get best arm now

481
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,668
in order to fix your I is over
configuration

482
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:34,179
basically need to create an access list
and that's what the first

483
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:38,080
said from lines does their

484
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,869
I'm you know just put your networks are
here we have an example

485
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,459
and then in the Options section you just
specify that

486
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,619
only does networks can do quickies only
does conclude a cousin

487
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,899
I in crate kisses something antiquated
despite

488
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:57,979
its much who want to because but the
same job

489
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,250
I am no another thing BCP 58

490
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,350
so I'll let's go back to the SlutWalk

491
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,439
let's think about I the attacker that
these sporting the victim source

492
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,950
sold one who's this back well with the
spec even be

493
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,049
allowed on the Internet like unlike I'm
some lean

494
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:21,090
they say in angola and I'm sending
packet

495
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,250
out that my network that is pretending
to be coming from the united states will

496
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,389
that doesn't make a lot of sense right
um

497
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:33,428
and the provided to which I'm adopting
knows that this space doesn't belong to

498
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:33,720
me

499
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,299
so they should not be letting me do that
there for some complications they don't

500
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,350
ask me why the sad song but let's say I
missed the Badia I'm

501
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,928
I'm I'm just small corporation I have 50
employees I have a single Internet

502
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:46,010
connection to the

503
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,049
internet why would my provider along to
send packets from

504
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:54,129
IP space that does not belong to me
there is really no reason for that

505
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:57,350
and this is basically will be /c be 58

506
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,359
says you know you should not be leading
pack is that don't belong here at the

507
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,309
space go out

508
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:04,649
this 70 other recommendations that as
well I

509
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:08,408
be spew of forty I it's talking about
how

510
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:11,869
how to actually come to give the crisis
so that you do not

511
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:18,770
I am participate is reflected in those
attacks

512
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,299
and game anycast I this is one of the
methods to

513
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:25,490
mitigate attacks against your helpful
helps cue up

514
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,990
if somebody's attacking you I you can
deploy

515
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,770
anycast Akt picture way you technique to
be here

516
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,490
multiple physical silver said multiple
physical locations the

517
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,780
all that pretends to be the same IP
address

518
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,080
so you know in the regular condition
have unique ask that this is where

519
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,820
baja spoke to another host Picasa
hypnotic us when you have wild horse

520
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,439
book into

521
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,990
particular group opposed and any guests
kind of like

522
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,460
I'll want think of it as a larger
grouping you can have many physical

523
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,389
hosts

524
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:59,570
that share the same IP address and every
user

525
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,600
that triste to talk to this but talk
this particular I did this will be

526
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,619
routed to the coarsest

527
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:09,639
I am silver sorbic acid

528
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:12,760
Egypt the beach with those use this is
looking for a fight fight fight

529
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,379
and they just get different physical
server know why is that important well

530
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:19,730
if you have a lot to do this but it's
dispersed botnet

531
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,330
that is attacking your DNS
infrastructure any you have to get a

532
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,559
service across

533
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,840
okay you know different continents have
let's say 45

534
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,470
and points of presence each of dole's
will be what could be attacked by the

535
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,929
boats in this particular

536
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,790
Adia instead of all the boats attacking
a particular site

537
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,440
so you're allowing get back to be
dispersed among manual cations

538
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,480
and even if they manage to take down the
end this Dennis Siver

539
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,919
at least in the beginning this is not
going to affect d other

540
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:53,850
the other locations to use to be up so
unique is your resilience in this way

541
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,699
arm now depending on how you have
position

542
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,879
the Syniverse there have been a lot of
things that can happen if they manage to

543
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,658
take one of the fund's dial

544
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:06,220
I but that that the city specific to how
you have your network

545
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,899
arm have your presence action um

546
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:15,699
help where you have presence and and so
on

547
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,730
and came al IPS endorsement addition
here that that's as i said i

548
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,970
them going to push any kinda hardware
I'll

549
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,210
success any additions and up

550
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:30,089
also this think percy can be another
stock on its own

551
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:33,639
on that there's up several vendors all
of them

552
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:37,908
manufacture fairly good year arm and
they have different approaches to

553
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:38,460
managing

554
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,950
attacks for example one of the things
they do with DNS queries

555
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,760
if they're attacking your DNS ever there
was actually send a CNAME

556
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,089
is a response we different name

557
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:52,168
and which is actually a Hess and then if
this was

558
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:55,389
I do you use that they would be able to
request

559
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:58,490
again is a mission for that from from
that team name

560
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,159
and then get video answer I'll if it is
somebody sporting an IP address

561
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,250
there will never be able to request that
again to

562
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:13,210
its kind of from singer having
challenges

563
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,089
%uh so why is this happening now white
where we seeing so much

564
00:32:17,089 --> 00:32:20,099
you know Tom sound what ways

565
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:23,270
the antacid give those attacks I'll
increasing

566
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,329
while we're getting more and more home
devices that they're capable of

567
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,800
resolving DNS

568
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,300
qualities for the users and

569
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,010
menu that come competed Institue that
exchange they were actors Open DNS is

570
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,190
overseas

571
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,409
so think a small Linksys software
actually i i

572
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:46,839
glancing Linksys I don't implied that
day are vulnerable to this is the first

573
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,908
men fiction it came to a head to my mind

574
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:52,159
but think a small Nexus out there on the
Comcast network

575
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,820
you sent place to it you know doesn't
need to do anything more than that

576
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,678
safety plays a second

577
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,849
if you sent it to grace the second to
this thing you can t tell us that the

578
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:02,189
2500 bites

579
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,220
on each way that's that's you know a lot
for one single small box

580
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,659
the home using multiple few that they
will not hear that

581
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:15,200
I am no multiply this by several hundred
or seven thousand box and see what

582
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,339
happens

583
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:20,820
um now some other manufactures mostly
coming from China

584
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,079
I do not even have the ability to have
this turned off so it

585
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,359
just cannot be computed the device it
doesn't so you can stick with that

586
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,359
a also I others liked

587
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,399
you know Comcast and the other providers
don't

588
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,579
I'll limit somewhat this traffic I am
and they probably should be

589
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:43,260
is there is no reason for a home users
to be

590
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,560
resolving queries to anyone on the
Internet the costar him a question that

591
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,089
just

592
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:50,369
staff inappropriate you know somebody
also because over the place

593
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:53,579
they will probably be running and Dennis
Siver in a caucasian

594
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:58,320
I'll and that decision no logic to that
from home

595
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,589
I'll so

596
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:05,310
another way to do with the promise
partnerships its really really important

597
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,529
basically from do with no work have
established connections with the watch

598
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,690
I divorce mediation providers and also

599
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:17,000
I'll companies like your company I shall
send my CD

600
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,030
you would a lot of the broking between
different parties

601
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:26,119
involved in the process so I am just as
an example the

602
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,450
Open DNS resource scanning that come
with us

603
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:33,239
what they would do is this can the
internet and see what the results are

604
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,549
all

605
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,429
on and if you have an edge that we don't
database

606
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,980
they will see which there was belong to
you and then they're going to

607
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,969
email didn't stay /div contact and then
you know all key I got a few this one

608
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,589
somebody'll minute from justice told in
open the course

609
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:52,659
um enough for watching it was is
somewhat common cause you know we have a

610
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,560
lot of people there

611
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,889
learning stuff you known stoning systems
so

612
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,900
it's useful to let um so

613
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,380
that's it on partnership you know this
what other people working on the problem

614
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,880
I get connections ahead of time from
usually when you're under the DOS

615
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,599
it's very difficult to good connections
is you have problems right now

616
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,839
your very best you want your problem
solved now which is retest a piece of

617
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:19,960
people on the other hand

618
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,970
online on if you can get to talk to
somebody on the phone so

619
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,240
um work with people have time

620
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,089
now I compromise CMSs so this is
something that cast

621
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,520
picking up again only about a year year
and half ago

622
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,310
or maybe a little more than that but I
mostly with President John Wall

623
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,040
this particular group that budgeting
does and will do with dual

624
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,839
is the police have custom Beach biscuits
are custom or skips

625
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,609
um did were executed the attacks

626
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:53,810
I'll starting

627
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,970
did fairly popular now they so what if
operators but

628
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:02,250
so and a big problem

629
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,300
now this is actually taken from one of
the

630
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,790
from 10 this case I have examined in the
past so this is

631
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,369
some of the effects that it was I'll
able to execute from a PHP script

632
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:17,410
I'll know why do I have seen bold it
well

633
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,830
you know how in a scene attack you can
basically

634
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,730
forge the source that this to a random
number generator in just

635
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,750
you don't have to walk back it's coming
from Brendan numbers going to some but

636
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,280
while

637
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,430
if you're using a compromise TMS the CMS
is not running as root

638
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,598
hopefully actually I am but

639
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,220
let in ninety five percent will be
running as root that would

640
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,240
mean that you cannot use all sockets
that means that you can use

641
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,618
for the source IP address what that
means that

642
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:50,680
the scene attack will be coming from
video IP address so

643
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,750
be mindful that if you have a seam
attack thank you

644
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,470
if you have a scene attack I'll do not
automatically

645
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,080
assume anymore that it is coming from
school study space

646
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,730
look at the AP space see if you have I
am repeating packets coming from the

647
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,070
same

648
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,690
eyepiece because you may be able to wash
a new mandate

649
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,830
the book made it is attacking you is one
of those borders its

650
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,279
so that section it's something that you
can do know that you can actually for

651
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,859
something a lot of arson attack

652
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:21,900
I and there are a lot of people that
actually

653
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,810
actively tracking botnets I am if you
get in contact with them

654
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,940
and give them least have the IP
addresses the most likely can identify

655
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,680
the botnet that is attacking you a

656
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,500
no something as if they didn't like and
that's correct this you know

657
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,170
the exec India follow option so dozier

658
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,390
not preset attacks like those this is s

659
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,740
call Corp basically allowing it to
inject

660
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:52,569
Markham yeah perfect this is allowing it
to inject your cold

661
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,720
I in base64 encoding and then it will be
executed their

662
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,790
she can just have any custom called
inject and executed from those servers

663
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,599
that means the

664
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,000
you just come up with a new idea but act
like right now

665
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,619
is kept at you push it out its on all

666
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,470
this is also a bit of a problem because
if you're researching this issue

667
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,919
trying to the forensics on a host that
was taken down because despite a botnet

668
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,140
it is fairly difficult to get dos you
know you have to

669
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,180
have the walks MTV The Walking then
don't think you'd be so you can have

670
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,629
those records that's also

671
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,790
they've always even worse you know

672
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:34,339
in the most of their so detectors are
getting smarter and smarter

673
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:37,509
so

674
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,760
again same story with the compromise to
missus are

675
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,460
most of those are compromised not
because you know the cold in bed just

676
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,580
because he's back but most to them a
compromise because they're in the state

677
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,230
did not pass them on time

678
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,390
I am and this is something that again
people have to be

679
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,970
half mortgage on if you are content

680
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,480
provided if your hosting provider in
children worth Press

681
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,040
Joomla for your customers make sure you
on top of patches

682
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,930
because otherwise is going to end it
only and is ultimately going to cost you

683
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,730
money because you're going to lose
benefits from the attacks the going out

684
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,099
of your

685
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,300
I also customers will go away at some
point

686
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:20,359
I'm so did that in mind day

687
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:26,080
questions

688
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:32,250
anybody right orchid one person here

689
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,410
her over or yet all

690
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,640
blood life

691
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,470
heatedly Road walk

692
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:49,470
yes yes well him all the time for

693
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,720
yes so I'm hiking

694
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,859
I can sing okay so there's multiple ways

695
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:02,210
up to that from the most important thing
when you have high-level talks like data

696
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:02,730
quest

697
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,670
is you can use divorce petition give the

698
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:11,560
designed to do that I am or you can also
do it on the cheap and by having

699
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,290
a watch that the result is curable
proxies so

700
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:19,050
think upon ng8 engine X you can have
many of those

701
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:23,810
up

702
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,650
for I

703
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,890
here

704
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,490
I will say yes orchid is that I would
say

705
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,750
a isn't using ajax is an example is
because it lost

706
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,960
no regular expressions on the incoming
traffic and also love to write your all

707
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,500
put his can I think per week and I
didn't see so

708
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,700
the moment you detect something specific
coming in this traffic

709
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,490
you can shooter on that particular thing
and job connections

710
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,069
immediately I'll and the on days

711
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:57,190
I'm suggesting up proxy forces up

712
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,630
water chips yes like I S its first see
more

713
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,670
it's important it's fast it's faster to
deploy were

714
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,349
it firewall more bouncer I

715
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:11,619
all bit were and

716
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:15,690
were other I'll year before

717
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,819
yes I'll each depending on your desired

718
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:23,579
see numbers in this phone you may want
people I'll building right behind the

719
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:24,380
wheel balancer

720
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,990
and I am you mention fire all

721
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,660
I would I don't know your environment
but the mostest

722
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,000
yet in most cases fire always not buying
a much in web traffic right

723
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,270
elicits a lot of these dissection
inspecting the web traffic

724
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,009
engine though it's not buying you much
but if you have a while you don't want

725
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,660
it to be

726
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,279
it difficult point in the very beginning
you want to move it somewhere

727
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,650
even behind the park's because you want
is

728
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,809
beautiful bed traffic should do office
possible because it is extremely

729
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:57,630
expensive from point to give processing

730
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:03,099
so basically think of it this way if
this is just like inside this is

731
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:06,559
this is your computing infrastructure I
am starts

732
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,309
start I am basically shedding the attack
of from this site

733
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:14,280
and half high-performance components
that the fairly cheap like

734
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,030
axis least in the beginning I guess
that's the thing with Texas everything

735
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,480
that goes

736
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,270
party on the interstate firewall there I
from that point

737
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:25,720
you won't be hearing all ballots in
small doses can also be exhausted

738
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,990
that that's another problem shop

739
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,290
does a tougher and also there are
certain ways you can run the shop than

740
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,720
anything else so you can have

741
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,140
that exit response which is going to arm

742
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,920
only to cash in on the coming packets
and then based on the haitian to send

743
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,290
the two

744
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,500
the front back and versus doing that
complete

745
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,869
the TCP session management and then
opening another

746
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:50,980
asset management some of them any proxy
mode

747
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,170
ass that

748
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,500
Bay or lead

749
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,099
you get to decide where that I'll show
you how to do this I let's go ahead take

750
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:02,440
this

751
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,559
and I yep date so yeah lol talked in
just a second

752
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,030
I am that the point actually two things
mostly on opened in this is always

753
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,420
because

754
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,150
it is a problem it is a very serious
problem in we need to step addressing it

755
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,970
then them

756
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:20,290
John Wagner can kinda see this is by
more people being aware of the problem

757
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:20,670
and

758
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,010
going in the curfew getting their
servers so I thing that's it other

759
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,530
questions

760
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:29,339
thank you guys

761
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:36,339
up say he

762
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:40,259
that

763
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:42,850
him

764
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:47,160
okay the question is if you're attacking
each organization in the mist

765
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,240
with the DoS attack what do you do now
so

766
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,479
I am at this point is a bit late

767
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,260
think about stuff you have to have a
plan before you actually get attacked

768
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,780
but

769
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,890
back to your question I work with your
provider

770
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,990
your network provider most likely
already here established partnerships

771
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,580
with different corporations that they
actually do that

772
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:12,390
I don't do those mitigation home one of
the easiest thing is to write your

773
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,920
traffic to what's coming

774
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,790
providers like alexi called of their
I'll come by

775
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,250
from this probably did fastest thing

776
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,410
to set up I wouldn't seized it cheapest

777
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,080
but it depends how much it would cost
you for your site to be dull saw

778
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:35,080
that's probably the the the easiest
thing to do

779
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,770
day questions cool

780
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:44,400
think I guess all

781
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,070
I forgot I'll Justin Edgar

782
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,920

small call

783
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,830

784
