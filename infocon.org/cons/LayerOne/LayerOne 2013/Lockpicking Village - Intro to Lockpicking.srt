warblers trend I'm unita

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,029
all ourselves to a higher ethical
standards so yeah well

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,989
their ground rules up

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:02,989
for as much logic only up

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,020
he heard under partial

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:15,020
her up look but there exists the
possibility of breaking love you

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,140
and it gave Europe

19
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,409
on by the front door well you know there
is a possibility

20
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,329
bring a and then you have a locksmith
wish generally of

21
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:35,470
money and Yahoo or month satellite

22
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,759
I and you only get lost you know what
all these on the table the

23
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,970
are purchased and used for the express
purpose

24
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,000
love or passing day is that you no
longer

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,210
for a while us yeah yeah I don't say
anything

26
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,908
yeah their way see what and

27
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,579
I so

28
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,548
dole up scared people

29
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,759
alright every fun

30
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,910
are I'll lot a secular basically

31
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,129
about school buses that are not working
prather

32
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:16,390
and my but what is fire yeah you're
silly

33
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,619
at and I have the light will enable I
could wipe all your firewall rules way

34
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,520
you know there is new real attack that
once

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,319
something a little after size you know
the right

36
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,149
God or other your home or intended yeah
I S

37
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,170
causes so you know it by

38
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,869
what years old with light and buzzer
henry's able to avoid listening to a

39
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,330
phone conversation well inside the
building

40
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,450
you know that security implications of
them

41
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,420
and so really is with good at it all
your hard work to your superior network

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,429
infrastructure

43
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,370
from yeah side of things really just
gets

44
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,890
undermined by the guy going home depot
and binder physical security hardware

45
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,899
because visible security really is but
the trunk are it doesn't matter

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,659
%uh Monday yes one of those exactly

47
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:10,459
but uses your goals it happens

48
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,940
maybe long so yeah really is

49
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,819
it's just you know a fight the blaster
systems it's already game or I could

50
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,089
pull off a hard drive second-lowest
something directly to your computer it

51
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,530
just

52
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,379
you know that is the trump card so
because you're kinda

53
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,390
matters little bit too um so

54
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,909
always will also look like this in the
you know some sort of container

55
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:35,040
but they look like that in Tylenol or

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,109
a problem like this all lots even though
they look

57
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,890
you know fairly different from the
outside on on the inside they're pretty

58
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,700
much identical

59
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,659
so that he sexually with a look like is
here

60
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,769
you have a X your house in the long run
this is the interior

61
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,769
or the plug the thing that I actually
wrote it since I N

62
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,769
get the key way here which is the way
that he goes then

63
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,799
the kelly also typically has come up a
little warnings here

64
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,330
and all these really do is they serve to
where they serve

65
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,840
I the purpose of preventing Aqeel one
system

66
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,909
from being inserted into another sister
right so get a sliding door

67
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:14,470
you know totally can't insert into a
quick set or record

68
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,160
so who is like this open we can see the
interior the cylinder

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,850
we can see the pen staggered because
that is made with three parts

70
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,460
a spring a driver been and keep them
some people may refer to as the top and

71
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,609
bottom pin hole or try to get away from
that

72
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,229
because especially you go over to europe
and they're not meant to like this

73
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:37,258
they're mounted like that so you're
referring to the top and bottom

74
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,180
containing very different things

75
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,669
people but from here so this is the
driver been detected the driver

76
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,770
much trouble the worst rather keep it

77
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,320
think that's the key done this here

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,469
service in the same day real life long I
wanna you know

79
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,960
same thing the other house in La Feria
that intercourse flooding

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,349
get the can stack and the spring driver

81
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,630
waukegan yeah so as far as how this loss

82
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,400
operate you know if you're just to try
to turn the cylinder

83
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,289
so how does look here here and I'm just
gonna get this

84
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,909
and just trying to turn he obviously
doesn't turn I

85
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,270
her so what's preventing that well it's
just

86
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,460
you know these kids are physically
preventing

87
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,060
that lock cylinder plucked from turn we
call a binding action

88
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,330
so but we insert the property

89
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,960
it raises the spins that cup to form
what we call a share lying there

90
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,349
what's your line is when the separation
between

91
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,740
the driver been and keep in lineup with
separation between the house and the law

92
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,880
adequate minimal are the pluggable when
the separations lineup

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,990
well look at that point that you're
right there and there's nothing he now

94
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,650
looks older

95
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,179
rotating solo case at exactly

96
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,569
other have a place in the bath which
actually a loss along no

97
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,979
again rosa her lifelong

98
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,380
he wasn't raised but not great

99
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,009
sure will have their what the share
owners and graded

100
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,509
the locks overturns roe case and opens
so question oh there's more than just a

101
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:22,819
single penny stock companies lost like
to hope so

102
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:27,729
I typically especially among the feel
cheaper american

103
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,099
lot packet loss

104
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,530
you only really how the variation on the
ski pants here all these

105
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,789
driver panzer process there and so

106
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:41,419
course the sizes love these keep them
score late what we call the believe the

107
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:44,469
key or the clue to the key

108
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,699
so if you wanna see how it works you
know that he goes in

109
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,120
these pins right along this period he
when he is fully inserted

110
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,229
shell informs alway cost of its own

111
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:00,258
what that chillin forms well again
nothing appealing law concerning

112
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,380
an opening so does

113
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,389
Sophia the in crafting

114
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,720
looks like they're both of the balloon

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,720
sorry that

116
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,000
bad at all

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,650
but alright XLVI incorrectly

118
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,370
presence the second cut right here as a
little bit too low

119
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,439
and so it'll be buying on just the tip

120
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,330
love that better and I there and that's
enough to prevent the loss column for an

121
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,090
opening

122
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,818
over to our same thing the protein
binding like keeping their

123
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,580
is this Luther on don't have any
questions about how long operates

124
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,340
okay so now what that mean ol kinda
Howell

125
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,479
you know a lot worse we can look at
actually

126
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,800
exploiting you know certain liabilities
are what nunn

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,289
especially picking la copa so we're
trying to imagine the inside the

128
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:05,990
cylinder

129
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,020
you know same here you know I want to
create a la cry I want to compete with

130
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,539
Ashleigh

131
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,659
quick set one up and so you know I trial

132
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,090
along design diagram in AutoCAD or

133
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,150
whatever bye prefer you know SolidWorks
sir

134
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,279
computer aided design program is I okay

135
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,969
you know I'm a place to manufacture has
made goes okay we'll

136
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,520
watercolors on go oranges

137
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,240
you know with I did crated in you make
it right

138
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,849
well tolerances are essential you know
how old

139
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,919
consistent things are to come off the
assembly line

140
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,689
so you know you could have even if
you're a mean with say a

141
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,050
diameter one milliliter you could have
been coming off the assembly line at 0.9

142
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,019
millimeters for one but 10 years you
have that parents

143
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:57,279
right and of course the higher haunches
their use your views are much more

144
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,949
sensitive

145
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:01,439
a machine which really factors that
process

146
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,720
you go okay well you know if you want to
use a higher tolerance is this law is

147
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,440
going to cost a lot of money on go on to
compete with

148
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,760
he'll play in fact that one of her for
well you know

149
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,250
then we have to start keeping the
process you know using a little bit

150
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,339
less precise machines using materials
that there's been no holes

151
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:26,149
feel or what not you know we'd make it
out cheaper materials like brasser maybe

152
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:26,750
even sing

153
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,040
as you keep making this whole month

154
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
I if you're trying to mount another
perfect will law

155
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,630
you know all these pitfalls will be
exactly circular right along its

156
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,060
management center line

157
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,149
and you apply a light turning pressure

158
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,779
all in fact that you buy it at the same
time right well

159
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,790
it actually is not the case because %uh
these you know

160
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,029
cheap enough the manufacturer partners
and even matter fact and professions

161
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,189
um know this is all other maple

162
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,190
impossible so if we look at this this is
a brand new law clerk to pressure the

163
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,810
package

164
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,029
and can see that it's some sort DeBary
mechanism

165
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,020
at the top of the voters polls and you
know this is introducing

166
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,069
these inconsistency is reason to fashion
a perfectionist

167
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:13,180
at these pins that bin Laden cutter 10

168
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,890
you can see there past infancy there's
little imperfections not casting process

169
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,300
there

170
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,199
I miss even go down to you know how
often

171
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:26,529
do you replace girl Italian right is
every time it really goes in a little

172
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,600
bit where the heart of gold

173
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,890
and it makes the next rule very very
slightly different

174
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,100
through and so you know there could be
other a

175
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,550
operations like is to be slightly
overweight in shape a little bit of a

176
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,329
long as much as race airline

177
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:46,089
but well as add up to is when I apply a
light turning pressure

178
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,699
this owner only one these bills taxes by
anyone hire

179
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm kinda thing that is like the honest
one out you know say if I had

180
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,250
her 3 p.m. right here in this one back
here this one is here and this one here

181
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,930
well you know if you draw a straight
line this on buying first on that one

182
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,640
not one right so that

183
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,220
letter said this is Karla add up to make
blocking possible it's kinda like

184
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,180
you've all seen like the hacker movies
where they go up and put the lights up

185
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,019
against Norton

186
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,209
the numbers fly by goes okay cracking
cracking

187
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:21,219
into next want 4

188
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,790
well you know those of you who are more
secure specials

189
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,160
you probably realize that passwords and
door locks in one hour

190
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,310
not like crap like that I notes you take
the whole hospital whole thing with the

191
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,819
whole thing but

192
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,060
looking how it works like packing
worsened movies we only really working

193
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,109
on one part this

194
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:43,150
solar a one-time so to just see the
general process

195
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,209
I mean first we apply a lettering better

196
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:49,819
and then we internally the whole paper

197
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:54,370
halftime inner know your preferred
lifting cool and we're just going to let

198
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,610
this can stack up

199
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,930
and so I will be talking about a few
things that you may

200
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,979
you know feel or see or hear even

201
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,550
I'm don't be afraid when going past them
that you're not feeling is that

202
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,640
this is just you know this is why long
Uniqlo actors

203
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,260
right is your cut train your fingers to
feel these things

204
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,110
and so what will actually happen is when
this gets its share

205
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,740
this plot will rotate a very slight
amount will rotate enough to form a

206
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,579
little look here

207
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,579
for this keepin' to have a restful her
sorry

208
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:32,849
ever been to address book on the keypad
will then be free to follow

209
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,290
downer you never got to tell the tale
right so

210
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,480
you know how this happened to basically
is on to the next higher

211
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,110
and so when we actually will get taken
as

212
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,170
and we apply veterans pressurized

213
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,670
are cutting tool apply attention
pressure that trying pressure

214
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,240
and you can see here that was the
binding to of course we don't know this

215
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,420
summer's going in

216
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,770
your traffic flow but we're going in
with her

217
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,459
look back here kinda feeling around
again it may not be immediately

218
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:05,959
perceptible to you

219
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,089
but the bike has docked actually
slightly

220
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,260
different a little bit harder to live
because think about it I mean

221
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,510
fraction as we added the whole process
you'd house unlocked wants to go this

222
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,279
way

223
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,939
and the coral of the one so this way and
they're just you know

224
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:23,500
their actively percy against both sides
that

225
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,279
the I'm fictional whole process makes a
little harder to lift

226
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,420
but again don't be afraid if you're not
actually feeling that you're first

227
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,890
starting out

228
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,130
so essentially just repeat that process
hunting for that bind

229
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,350
pin all throughout this lock and tell
opens up its

230
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:44,800
and lots of things hold so a 100
questions on a

231
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,779
him alright so to go

232
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,500
a little bit more interesting details
here is about you know how things

233
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,540
actually and work and what not

234
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,110
what we're talking about here is was
called Liberty picking or single parent

235
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,010
dating

236
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,329
on this is generally the thing you want
to try to practice with

237
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:07,819
you know this is the things that is much
for school base its

238
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:11,010
as you will get better and better it
will be a look pic higher and higher

239
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,870
costs the looks like this

240
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,899
and there is another technique though
hold rating

241
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,520
and this is usually worse you know the
tools to how little squiggle

242
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,300
or some sort of all shape that isn't
you're just a single

243
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,959
litter or single thing and basically
those are rick's

244
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,809
so how Redfin works it's a much more
look based activity

245
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,679
we inserted into all a pleasure to
pressure only just going here first

246
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,220
correcting around me a very angles

247
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,439
kinda moving up and down hopefully by
luck expect ok

248
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,170
as the thing about repeated if it's
going to work it's definitely going to

249
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:47,620
work

250
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,679
relatively quickly right I am

251
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,800
and so it is a much more lot basic
happens the lace

252
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,870
which is why a lot of people to start
all really you know take to rate

253
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,350
because he was working I cannot the
marksman but

254
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,350
before other thing you'll find a
breaking is especially when you get into

255
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,829
the

256
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:08,839
a you know more difficult levels a loss

257
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,850
I'm especially getting to you know
security plans and

258
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,699
Parihar what up really becomes much less
effective

259
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:19,120
I mean in competitions so the first
thing I i try because you know it's

260
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,399
gonna work is work going to work quickly

261
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,329
I'm but singleton picking is really
nothing wanna practice to get to the

262
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:26,459
higher

263
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,979
you know work that Olympic

264
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,990
so a little bit on tension for usage so

265
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,160
first off you know I love people well

266
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,020
I should do senators I'm here I we talk
about a few things that

267
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,319
you know I find work for most people
don't be afraid if it doesn't work for

268
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:44,679
you

269
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,420
block witness although passing in trying
different things and find out what works

270
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,270
for you

271
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,480
so what i'm talking about things but
feel free to try different ways

272
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,059
BC 52 they work for you awesome users

273
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:00,370
but this curve you know gives you a
little bit of a starting off point

274
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,870
so generally I don't want attention with
my phone because I find I get a little

275
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,760
bit less control over that

276
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,939
and so generally I want to use my little
pointer finger here

277
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:14,990
know here I prolly still looking like
this because I find that when you pick

278
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,380
with your finger up here you have you
know

279
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,890
a little bit I less control over its so

280
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,990
by answer this like that you know here

281
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,650
I have much less control over the
variability up that tension pressure

282
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,039
than I do

283
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:36,360
you know much more out here so I can
recommend kinda stretch it out there

284
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,000
are still not quite there because you
notice the finger straying away

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,900
which generalizes obvious I know you're
putting way too much pressure on

286
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,939
attention

287
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:46,939
it really is not require much I'm

288
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,990
I'm in fact if I just have a locking up

289
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,730
and I have a property well I the term
really really doesn't

290
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,559
and so really it's just I a quiet too
you know

291
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,360
roughly about half the amount press
download laptop keyboards

292
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,970
iron you know imagine the way to three
butterflies the end of the year

293
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,709
more visual learner it really does not
require much though

294
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,039
in fact you'll probably find that we're
passing picking you know it takes a

295
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,099
while that long but he took it block

296
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,500
try to get a little bit later per
attention pressure on

297
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,880
and you may even have your cock pic I'm

298
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,179
so like I said it's very obvious when
you know your fingers for train white

299
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,459
you take your figure a way has line
across

300
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:31,650
finger at the very clear indication is
in a bit too much trash

301
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,970
pressure so

302
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,720
a there are two main considerations when
you insert essential into the

303
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,690
tool are so it's the clock the first
thing is you don't put all the way at

304
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,400
the bottom

305
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,870
is if we put all that bottom well

306
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,459
you know this piece the middle here will
essentially be

307
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,159
running up against the house in lockers
and no I picture the whole process

308
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,530
and make things a bit more difficult to
were to take over

309
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,129
secondly you want how you know another
room up here to be able to insert

310
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,370
essential and

311
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,799
you know maneuver around busy don't have
that's room

312
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,840
well by have I tend to like this

313
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,320
you know I have no room to go anywhere
little actually manipulate

314
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,480
the individual yes so they're those main
considerations

315
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,760
I'll there's I you know

316
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,549
what people have tools for free to share
I think I may have some for public use

317
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:27,520

318
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,240

to start with they have numbers on them

319
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,929
%uh those numbers indicate how many
planes within the Saunders so

320
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:42,030
seizing one for example will have just
wanted and everyone sort of like that

321
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,020
keep on going to go to and what not I'm
one thing about the

322
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,950
the one can lock actually why was it
about this

323
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,159
is more similar things feel good because
it doesn't require much dick gets off

324
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,370
and I just a potential

325
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,520
answer like that let that thing open it

here says there's no tension pressure on

332
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,879
their

333
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,120
is just the pressure in the spring
pushing down right now

334
