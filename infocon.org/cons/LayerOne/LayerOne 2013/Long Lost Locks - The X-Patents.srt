1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,389
up

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,148
okay so are for stock in the day is
going to start presently

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:10,809
we have Skyler town giving is pretty
much british girl

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:16,630
X locks X locks sir like X files but
with Locke said

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:23,630
in

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,769
thank you very much

7
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,820
I am I'm a bit six you'll forgive me if
I've turned to the

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,610
back six minutes ago here at some point
during the talk but I'm pretty excited

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,230
to

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,849
be the summit formally launching this
project today

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,980
I launched as I watched semi-public Leah
be caught in Boston a few weeks ago

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,029
since then we've got some volunteers
come on board we started digging up some

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,440
really great information

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,949
gonna break down on talking about here
in just a moment

15
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,500
alright so I'm Skyler town I am I am

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,680
Sabrina locks King 5 news at shoebox on
Twitter lock dodgy

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,229
I am but all I really want you guys to

18
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,220
know today as far as how to get in touch
and what to do about the project is this

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,860
address

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,560
X dot lock that Gd X dot law

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,520
dot GD I am Loctite GD I pronounce a
lock

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,589
god it's my personal URL shortener you
have to have the lake

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,610
outlet for the acts like tragic says
that X top lock that Gd

24
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,090
the idea here is that 1836

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,920
there is a fire at the patent office
which destroyed somewhere on the order

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,950
of 10,000 different patents

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,820
other which around 20 percent of those
real to be recovered

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,500
in that mix were a lot of block patents
I am

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,170
men have the lock pets have been fully
recovered though we do have

30
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,380
letters patent for a few images for
review

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,030
I'm working on transcribing someone at
its center but for very many of these

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,200
may have nothing at all

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,969
so the push to recover all those patents
from the patent office fire

34
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:03,689
ended not long after the fire was put
out there to sort it moved on created a

35
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:04,210
new

36
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,860
structure for taking on new patents ask
people who have lost patent

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,080
to resubmit and that's about the extent
of it ham

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,129
after a decade or so pretty much
everybody just stop trying

39
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:18,149
there are few independent projects are
you telling people that have come across

40
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,540
patents is there's got on the first or
the same to the database

41
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,660
but as lock so the thing that I care
most about in this world

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,459
for those patents that are locks I'm
making it my personal mission

43
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,830
to restore as much information as
possible about everyone at the locks

44
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,140
though we lost let fire

45
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,250
to restore whatever the patent office
will accept restored to the patent

46
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,730
I am record and aside from that as
they're not going to accept absolutely

47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,040
everything that I'm finding a mosque
going to try to

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,629
bill they'll be resource X not locked
out GD

49
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,260
for other researchers in triple but even
just have a passing interest in all this

50
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,319
Sep today again this was the patent
office

51
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,599
back I am early eighteen hundreds before
it started burning all the time

52
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,849
I am the he at the patent office went
through several fires

53
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,569
I it came very close to being burned
down in 1814 when all the rest

54
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:11,839
Washington was burned down

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,800
but this guy who was the Commissioner
pads at the time

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,409
said to some British soldiers hey can
you guys please help me protect

57
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,679
this one building in just for everything
else please

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,830
this has real importance to mankind and
he was able to talk to soldiers into

59
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,349
actually

60
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,390
helping him protected this against the
other British soldiers as they were

61
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,659
burning the rest Washington

62
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,569
so we survived that only to burn down a
few years later

63
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,738
and had not fired 1836 twenty years
later but

64
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:42,930
I am despite be horrible threat to
Washington

65
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,450
well I can really say this so a.m. the
building burned down we lost a lot of

66
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,569
stuff Mets sucked

67
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,149
they were completely ignorant about what
they need to be doing for the past this

68
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,290
time as matter fact

69
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,780
it burned down in a transitional space
what was being moved from a not very

70
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,220
fire resistant building

71
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,950
to a fireproof building and it burned
down in the interstitial space

72
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,409
which was also not fireproof I am

73
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:14,069
this if you are a fires at the patent
office collor you will know this

74
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,430
actually is not the patent office fired
1836 this is that lapsed buyer

75
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,220
1877 Sears in the building burned a lot
I

76
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,770
there would be several other smaller
file fires in another fires at the

77
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,340
National Archives this is the

78
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,099
I am this is patent office built after
the fire pit in 36 is one that later

79
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,680
burnin'

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,180
77 so well burning modifier lot up

81
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,180
dead room patents him so this project
that is a saying at the start is to try

82
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,859
to recover as many of the lock patent
specifically

83
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,050
I there tell a patent in there tell
people that have been really excellent

84
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,710
work

85
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,789
in trying to recover as much information
as pets as possible

86
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,360
and to that end up actually relying on
the leg work have one of those groups

87
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,970
I am the directory American tool and
machinery patents

88
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,020
and this was a couple different mail
service where a bunch of old

89
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,460
tool and die guys were very very
interested in the history of tools

90
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,620
made in America and some international
as well

91
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,380
and so they went through when they
actually documented as a volunteer

92
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,240
project

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,530
every single tool related patent

94
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,969
thankfully for me this also includes at
least in antiquity locks

95
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,740
so these guys have a comprehensive
record evolved

96
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,160
local all the patents that were lost to
the fire

97
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,590
now just because they have the patent
number in the name of the site leave the

98
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,909
patent doesn't mean they have any other
information

99
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,020
but they at least have that having gone
through the roles are the

100
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,289
records are the patent office that

101
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,440
managed to survive even bans
assault-style

102
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,319
so never pretty good a set up here we're
gonna go ahead and

103
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,650
workforce mock patents XO

104
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,830
millions of fans are going to have a lot
of clock patents clocks were also a big

105
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,639
game industry back in the day

106
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,319
I took the point actually that there
were at least one

107
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,580
and anecdotally two different clock
works in the state of Connecticut but as

108
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,270
locks became a boom industry

109
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,780
just went out not to the sea of the
building change their machinery a little

110
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,000
bit became clock and became law clerks

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,449
I am now that helps us at all so

112
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:29,860
let's see let's have a look at Pioneer
ass in this is William hi

113
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,169
I am on the construction blocks you'll
see the same guy has another patent

114
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,680
in the x-series this is why the call the
ex-lax everything before

115
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,360
1836 I whether recovered and not
recovered whatsoever has been given

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,940
a number designation followed by the
letter X

117
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,550
there a couple others will have special
designations on top of that like

118
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,650
FX or an X or px I am

119
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,948
but all a bit is to say that these
burned and we may or may not have

120
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,710
anything recovered from the whatsoever

121
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,770
and then the patent office starting to
get one after back

122
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,500
them built back up to you what it is
today

123
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,669
I'm so what are the things that I want
to mention about to talk here I am

124
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,740
they've done a lot of great work I but
because the working of historical roles

125
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,389
and

126
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,949
if there's no recoverable information
about the patent can stop there

127
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,770
sometimes basic things even like last
names are actually entirely correct

128
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,380
that admittedly I need to at some point
report data errors or omissions to the

129
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:26,930
Sox

130
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,289
because they provide me away tears I'm
not complaining it is entirely on meet

131
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:31,830
by the misinformation

132
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,050
I but in the case William Pye William
high is actually Pyke

133
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,069
I'm then there's a good man to
biographical information about the pies

134
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:40,580
will actually talk about them

135
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,840
in a little bit rate now we have no
recoverable anything the link up to

136
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,369
Google patents in the US Patent Office
images

137
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,229
I am but all they've done is

138
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,430
just filled in the basic information
that clearing needs

139
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,090
it doesn't actually mean if there's
anything there I frugally there will be

140
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,780
something there but in this case we got
nothin

141
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,289
I except vs

142
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,909
Zotero is the tool that I am using for

143
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,599
all of my research I am generous pretty
slick

144
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,889
it provides a means the

145
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,080
quickly saving any interesting thing
that you find from the internet for many

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,930
years searchers

147
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,690
syringe a store patents or even if it's
just a random web page you can get a

148
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,620
snapshot a bit

149
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,470
lot details when you can add annotations
tax it centered Center

150
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,830
now in particular because I want this
should be a fairly public projects

151
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,098
actually keeping a public

152
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,120
and we'll go back to hear record-keeping
a public database

153
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,969
up everything that we're doing so
anytime hire somebody else is working on

154
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,190
the project right now finds a new
interest in peace

155
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,510
information we save it or locals are a
client we

156
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,149
dad tags or any other information that
needs and as soon as we sink back up to

157
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:51,950
the server

158
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,519
it's available for everybody to see what
we're finding serrate now

159
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,260
there's just a ton love stuff

160
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,540
and its relatively well organized you
actually did go deep into the grid

161
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,899
library this by the way

162
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,830
is ordering .org slash group slash x-10
ox

163
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,740
I am an immigrant labor you can see that
it's much better structured

164
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,370
by each of the individual patents

165
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,570
some who don't have much information yet
sum up the

166
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,790
have a good amount of information I am
back

167
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,279
this is where you can follow the project
in a just data-driven way to see what

168
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,959
we're fighting every single day

169
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:36,959
okay I let's go back though and talk
about

170
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,709
yes these guys the camels

171
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,079
excellent the so

172
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,540
when we're looking at the pad record has
a set up a top something's been

173
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,240
recovered at least partially we have
maybe the letters patent in a scam

174
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,050
we maybe have some illustrations in some
cases you have a a little bit a both of

175
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,240
which is fantastic

176
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,200
in the case of the Campbells here we
actually got very lucky and I if we

177
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,730
follow this through to the

178
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,839
Google Inc we not only have

179
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,170
one piece and rising from the dry
specifications

180
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,290
but we also have a relatively clear

181
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,670
scandal letters patent has never been a
transcript made a mess

182
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,390
so this is one of the first things that
I began working on myself

183
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,870
and now on the server a page we have no
appended to this entry for the camels

184
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,360
where you can actually read the full
text transcription for their patent

185
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,630
I am this describes in full how they
expected to operate

186
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,910
and then I'd write a little bit of
context just fruits notes in the

187
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,920
abstract explaining

188
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,810
the basics and how it operates we're
gonna get back to the camels in america

189
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,420
is that actually gets more exciting as
we go along

190
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,849
but them for now

191
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,990
talk about the transcription process I
throughout this project I'm looking for

192
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,570
volunteers to help me with

193
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,450
transcription to just help me with
general research I will assign you and

194
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,930
me

195
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,229
wannabes inventors and you're gonna find
out as much detail about them and dump

196
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,180
it is a row

197
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,099
and would be amazing I am people that
are helping with access to databases

198
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,269
3d printing center to center but I we
have company right now working on

199
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,810
transcription so this year we're gonna
start

200
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,130
rate here we're gonna and down here this
release

201
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,290
the lock may be in any form or
dimensions and the size and form

202
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,880
love the wire should be varied
accordingly

203
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,860
however so the lot may be in any form or

204
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,589
dimensions gets a little bit lost but
you can probably make that up is

205
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:33,540
contextually

206
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,310
these are just really crappy on waivers
and I am

207
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,399
which confuse the person who is helping
you transcribe this initially

208
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,740
the size and form of the just totally
looks like right

209
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,630
or white whatever the case may be but
again as you dig into the transcription

210
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,170
Duke up with these you realize that
there's a lot of common language

211
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,319
and so I can reasonably guess that is
why and you'll see why a pop over and

212
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,680
over again for some reason

213
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,260
he always crosses the are his wire with
the end

214
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,160
he's always looks like wat or right or
something like that but

215
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,069
again if you've got a couple of these
answer if you're interested in working

216
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,930
on transcriptions I will happily look
over your shoulder is

217
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,930
during the first one to give you an idea
of the language of the

218
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,029
up the timing of the subject matter
should be there and accordingly it

219
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:17,660
senator

220
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,029
3 met totally looks like if but

221
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:25,370
its ups go real secret on that

222
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,029
just doesn't make sense but if okay ed

223
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,200
I this is what a job in helping you
right now transcriptions I have another

224
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,860
one this guy's actually submitted a
couple ever

225
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,540
committed full transcriptions to the
project so far Chris french junior

226
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,760
I total up with 3m's literally on
Twitter

227
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,790
I really good guy I met him at a
conference couple years ago on his arm

228
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,490
and good friend ever sense I has you'll
see a couple his emissions laws under

229
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,680
pressure to transcriptions and his work
Tom

230
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,989
got another guy david has just had a
suspension assigned to him so hopefully

231
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,130
he'll begin but some

232
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,570
great step back to me soon and a couple
other people doing so the

233
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,329
database diving to in databases that I
don't have access to your area

234
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:10,099
alright so sometimes we have them go
this is as a dissection just one

235
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,670
appearance

236
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,110
transcriptions to see you can see well
things that he has contributed estrogen

237
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,649
I yet to a bigger now we don't can
always understand absolutely everything

238
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,490
so even if all you want to do is take an
afternoon and go through it read through

239
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,070
one of the transcriptions already there

240
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,820
to see if you catch something that we
didn't that would also be awesome that's

241
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,540
a

242
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:35,540
big hand for us been sadly some other
scans look more like this

243
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,480
and you don't have any original to go of
love

244
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,260
I am so this one's going to be harder
I'm yet to assign a static the people

245
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,899
working on transcriptions gonna think
what we actually need to somebody who

246
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:49,320
does

247
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,949
image analysis work to some degree to
see if they can bring out any of the

248
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,459
lettering there are too many

249
00:13:54,459 --> 00:14:00,219
joke there so you're interested in that
many people for that as well

250
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,649
alright the camels lock we mention this
before

251
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:09,410
I am

252
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,420
so it's really slick in the way it
operates

253
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,810
then this

254
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,339
these are two wheels that will face
outward looking at the back side

255
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:25,019
a block would be installed this is the
bolt assembly with the book currently

256
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,889
thrown this is the

257
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:30,060
only part that protrudes into the frame
at the door this

258
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,510
is just the stops it stopped against the
interior wall

259
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:40,300
block and then this here busy little

260
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,310
this here well actually block

261
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,839
the bold mechanism from holding back
into the lock itself

262
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,889
it will block it until this bar

263
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:55,620
that runs along that locking mechanism
can fall into the two true gates

264
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,980
these two combination wheels say

265
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,070
what's happening is that each other not
jours in these wheels

266
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,410
are false gates except for once they're
not quite deep enough

267
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,110
but it'll still feel like you've set the
bar in place

268
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,870
across the two wheels there are seven
false kids want regain on each of them

269
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,930
you need to have them both align
properly

270
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,819
so the that barking pole into place this

271
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,519
can slide against the face I love the
walk itself

272
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,670
and this bottle now slide over that

273
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,160
because there's a little bit of
clearance between the both mechanism

274
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,130
both assembly

275
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,459
and the face block so this pushes toward
the face a block

276
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,569
actually recommend that you have some
sort of tool to put in

277
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,940
because they don't bother putting a
spring on to anything INC poet

278
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,850
interposition

279
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,050
in the balkan slide back with the key
operated through here

280
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,250
polling on that pushing it in that
direction

281
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,449
sup it scared me just looking at it
initially I had no idea what I wasn't I

282
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:56,589
was able to get the transcription done
read through

283
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:00,180
they have another iteration have a
similar idea down here

284
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,649
I'm not going to get into right now I am
because this is sort of the

285
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:09,130
the showpiece the talk right now now
from our security perspective this can

286
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,240
absolutely be opened II KN

287
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,829
completely figure out where the tree
gate isn't doing you know against the

288
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:16,758
false gates

289
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,699
I am the there is no additional security
in the key space whatsoever this is

290
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:22,620
basically just a

291
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,370
big slugger metal that's gonna spend
probable mechanism in

292
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,060
this is not particularly his security
but it is damn clever

293
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,069
and it's really neat and it's something
that hasn't existed

294
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,070
excited this guy's mind in the by
reactions at the patent office

295
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,509
for a very long time

296
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,050
and there are few things that x8 me more

297
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,389
then digging back into the history of
security back into the history blocks

298
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:54,079
and keys and glass increase in
mechanical engineering

299
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,060
and plucking out a little peace and
shrewd got lost somewhere along the way

300
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,589
and say look at what this super clever
person came up with

301
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,799
isn't that cool anorexic gonna keep
coming back to camelot throughout the

302
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,168
talk a little more to say about it as we
go

303
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:13,130
I services that we've James Kyle know
James can we have no letters patent

304
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,030
whatsoever

305
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,579
but we have other resources than just
continuing to hit the patent record in

306
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,230
hoping that something's been recovered

307
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,260
sexually rare that anything's been
recovered some cases Jim Scherr actually

308
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,160
lucky enough

309
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,870
to happen image but we have no letters
patent to explain what we're looking at

310
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,349
here whatsoever

311
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,280
but thankfully it was I love another
interest

312
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,590
to Fox at VI Journal the franklin
institute state pennsylvania

313
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:41,689
to describe 4s its function and their
company this

314
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,039
miss larkin multiple forms has been
described in a couple issues of the

315
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:45,820
journal

316
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,918
I'm but here we have reading at 26 in
particular

317
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,880
for the present on the door lock for
which the proceeding pat was obtained

318
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,950
James Kyle below

319
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,549
blah we mention the walk upon which this
is an improvement in very favorable

320
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:58,480
terms and those alterations which

321
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,020
experience a suggested in it have
certainly read it much more perfect

322
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,559
for the lever latch is working a part of
ok Roman raised by the key victories but

323
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,270
particularly in center to center

324
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,650
but then it concludes with as we have
formally observed formerly observed a

325
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,600
drawing would be required to render its
construction intelligible

326
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,740
but we have to try to you actually use
their mobile descriptions in this locker

327
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,850
which they had never write an
illustration for

328
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,080
and the one thing that was recovered in
the patent fire for this lock

329
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,990
really put them together and get a real
understanding how that works that

330
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,610
the patent office probably is not going
to have any interest in accepting

331
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,729
a general description up how the thing
operated in place in letters patent

332
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,799
at no point I'm do I expect the United
States Patent Office to take

333
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,168
James kyle's driving and added by

334
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:50,320
my project description of how work to
their records

335
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,750
and that's the other important thing
about this project is that I wanted to

336
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,049
stand for a long time

337
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:59,280
I wanted to stand for an indefinite
amount of time

338
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,090
because the patent office is going to
have stringent controls on what can be

339
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,879
considered patent literature

340
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,000
I want to be able to describe fully have
a lot of work that we no longer after

341
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,850
the bad office

342
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,799
even if they're not going to publish so
we're going to keep this information

343
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,418
available

344
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,480
X not locked out GD in fact I would like
to build on the PRI's the people can

345
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,650
just dig in and get

346
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,770
structured information about it should
be ex-lax that we have available to us

347
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,960
and maybe at some point in time if this
project works out as

348
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,059
well as I would dream that word after
after however many years it will take to

349
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,160
get this

350
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,679
exactly where I would want it maybe the
structure of all this would be the sort

351
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,320
of thing that other people doing patent
diving could use

352
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,750
to if not fully recover patents to at
least

353
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,150
fully describe a and explore patents on
their inventors

354
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,679
okay now this is another interesting
situation where we actually have no

355
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,090
recovery what's so

356
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,309
ever from the United States Patent
Office but

357
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,428
in the case of Abraham lawyer Stansbury

358
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:03,400
I'm his invention was very very
important

359
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,000
and he patented it England as well

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,010
and his letters patent from england are
in perfect shape

361
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,650
so this is I am specification the patent

362
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:20,039
to whom these presents shall come but
Center in New now even in compliance

363
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,289
with the Sentra Visio

364
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:28,289
I have a city Redwood City Center
there's a remark Larry language learners

365
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,190
there is something there to catch them

366
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,650
answers goes on for a very long time I
can resolve it to you the reason that

367
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,169
this is important actually

368
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,909
I'm you can see this and other toxic
mine but a guy

369
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,539
named I'm avant de then went to Egypt
where

370
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:51,679
I napoleon when the boy was trying to
conquer Egypt he discovered the

371
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,840
is the pin to unlock the antiquity turns
out this thing around for thousands of

372
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,539
years

373
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:59,510
he comes home talks about it gets
translated into English in the sky

374
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,879
Stansbury it says %uh oh that's awesome

375
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,970
I am going to patent it and and so he
filed a patent free version of what he

376
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,620
refers to you in the I at least in the
american specification as the Egyptian

377
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,120
lock

378
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,820
so this is an important moment in
history came to my watch list for

379
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,760
security in general but anyway we have

380
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,200
a long drawn out perfectly collected I
am

381
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,679
letters patent from the British office
which have different standards admitted

382
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,830
leaving the American office

383
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,860
I do not know this to be a final I do
not know if the United States Patent

384
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,418
Office be one to replant

385
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,150
the British specifications or provided
at around the same time for executives

386
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,919
lock we cannot know actions say we
cannot know but I don't know and

387
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,450
it turns out that it's really hard to
really hard to report a bug in Google

388
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,370
Pattinson really hard to get touched
anybody at the patent office

389
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,979
in order to help them recover battle but
I'm working on that as well

390
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,159
I anyway all the scrolling is

391
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,360
or something rate here excite so

392
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,289
we also have a drawing up his lock in
the way that was meant to operate it is

393
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:04,840
actually significantly different than
the judge lucky antiquity

394
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,049
I am disguise desperately trying to get
these things produced in england and it

395
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:10,940
was a really really poor E

396
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,530
poorly I am inventor this lock in
american came over to this country in

397
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,110
1805 unpatented

398
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,879
and it was very assiduous and was very
assiduous indifferent to get introduced

399
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,000
in which attempt however he met with
some little encouragement

400
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,720
but it may be deemed a failure I've
never really except for

401
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,380
you know the the very specific and
excited interested historians

402
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,580
it was a complete failure for him as a
as a

403
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,220
you know security and financial and ever

404
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,549
I so how does the recovery process work
as i've just

405
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:46,230
searched for this separately specific
term generally myself

406
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,010
an actual paper mill now have the more I
talk gonna make me terribly October 2002

407
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,510
it was a bit slow but talk

408
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,169
so here's how the recovery process works
I am

409
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:58,970
if you are working with me or if I am
working with myself

410
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,350
usually I very specifically will go into
work in my fiance to her barista job at

411
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,490
Starbucks by 15 in the morning

412
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,809
and I will sit at that Starbucks in
research a single person for about eight

413
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,850
hours just trying to get as much
information as possible

414
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,908
every time I come across a page I am

415
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:19,950
I have my center effect client ok im I'm
services at a red light for your

416
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,120
personal workspace you will use it
yourself

417
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,610
manual sync it to the server I am what
that the clan allows you to do is as you

418
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,620
browse around places

419
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,049
you can save this onerous that said lead
researcher from current page miss Lois

420
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,210
even to you

421
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,900
whatever some full movie you're looking
at

422
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,039
so if today is the day that I'm gonna
try to find out as much about jerry

423
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,629
Brown's I possibly can

424
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,559
I going to Jay brown and I just going to
town with various resources that are

425
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,840
available to me

426
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,399
now once I decided that I want other
people to start helping me out with this

427
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
I also collected all those resources

428
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,150
into the federal page so read up here in
first pass resources

429
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,770
we have to Tampa trib Rd looked at we
have Google patent search party looked

430
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,100
at

431
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,000
Google Books is where a couple the
passages that I just read came from

432
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,350
that Sri find the British specifications
in Stansbury is lock

433
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,370
I'm on a good staff to meet an american
very easily limit your search is to

434
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,139
3 1983 1836 specifically if that's what
you wanna do

435
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,679
I'm def tell a good information archive
daughter is fantastic as well there's no

436
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,630
good reason I don't have that up here
right now

437
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,390
I am alright so what to talk about these
other to their families searching

438
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,549
faulting history

439
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:33,460
I am a.m. well discovered this very
quickly this is just a collection love

440
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,510
dozens and dozens and dozens

441
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,610
I have mostly small community or
university projects

442
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,918
to collect databases on their local
newspapers

443
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,039
so this is local newspapers to go back
to the range that we are researching

444
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:51,200
that you can go through and try every
single name

445
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,659
out on a limb goes comb through these
databases up to find something

446
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,360
their situations where somebody was
banned popular enough in their day

447
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,850
but you're going to get hits in just got
anything in New England because you'll

448
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,750
be seeing

449
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,200
the same ad in a newspaper over and over
and over again you spend three

450
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,900
hours if your life and that tripled run
a peppermint mocha

451
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,770
trying to find any new piece of
information and it is super

452
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:21,090
super boring work until those moments
when you do find something interesting

453
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,959
and then you are reaching back into the
depths of history to rip some truth up

454
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,919
into the present

455
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,159
max how you should feel about it to keep
yourself excited

456
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,500
then go get another mocha kids are
getting tired alright so

457
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,000
I am their newspaper magazine archives
is self-explanatory

458
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,809
dozens and dozens and dozens of them
this is not every newspaper magazine

459
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,559
archive that is available for the United
States

460
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,080
but these are the ones specifically that
I found to go back to the date ranges

461
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,629
that we're trying to investigate and we
backed first best resources

462
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,850
quickly look at I am FamilySearch here

463
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,090
I've survey research is actually
sponsored by the Mormon Church

464
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,678
I am the Mormons if you did not know
this has been going around for a very

465
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:05,370
long time trying to create a perfect
genealogy

466
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,570
America and other nations as well I

467
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,020
but I remember when I was very little
kid they came to our city hall

468
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,639
and there were literally just people
taking microfilm pictures are

469
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,760
everybody's like

470
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,270
for combat in census records so we had a
motel ma'am

471
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,559
remember I go the movies here as I know
that some mornings do that's all you

472
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,990
have arms-for-hostage

473
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,260
I am but in recent years they have made
this information available to any

474
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,549
geological storage research restoring it
centered center

475
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:39,470
and it's a phenomenal resources freezers
for trying to pin down

476
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,450
biographical information about these
inventors now this is not their locks

477
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,960
and nothing we find out biographical is
going to be worth

478
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,809
anything to the patent office but as you
hopefully discovering the people we

479
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:50,610
going to stop

480
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,879
restoring the patents to the patent
office is exciting is that is an end-all

481
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,429
is far from my ultimate goal I want to
be able to tell the stories

482
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:02,929
every single one bag I want to be able
to tell the stories in the invention

483
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:04,820
every single one of these locks

484
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,520
the people that are involved in this are
just as interesting as the things they

485
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,020
made

486
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,650
I and the the anthropology is just as
interesting to me is the

487
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,740
mechanics evolved s so I am

488
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,490
FamilySearch turns out to be a great
resource for finding census data for

489
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,070
making sure that the guy that you're
looking into that you think is from the

490
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,250
area that is from

491
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,980
actually has anything on record to back
that up

492
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,610
I early on with the Campbells that lock
to keep talking about they were gonna

493
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,678
keep coming back to

494
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,440
I have found no genealogical information
for the game

495
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,390
for the camels what so ever from the
area that they were supposed to be from

496
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,640
I have found nothing

497
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,279
they are ghosts perhaps the name is
incorrect perhaps

498
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:49,510
whatever it was registered under
initially was incorrect

499
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:53,158
I whatever day tempted never been told
that some peas information summer long

500
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,490
lines and play it right

501
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,289
and so I'm hunting hunting hunting to
provide any sort of background

502
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:58,990
biographical story

503
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,809
to this group of people the media really
interesting lock

504
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:06,460
and I what that fielded just as much as
I want to

505
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,580
rebuilding a walk from scratch right

506
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,279
so villagers good resource as are a lot
of other geological data bases but this

507
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,330
is the free one

508
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,189
this is one you can go to and spend a
day on him dig around forever

509
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,039
I am alright Sep

510
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:25,149
there the other one is crazy

511
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:28,770
so this is faulting history now
full-time history

512
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,250
we pull back over to you here yeah

513
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,570
said this is the website for full
history I am

514
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,230
there is this is one of my favorite
parts down here

515
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,950
this is the guy's face an extra I and a
bunch a little legs like a spider

516
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,770
crawling around the internet

517
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,980
I there is a shattered window here you
can see very well that is mostly just

518
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,720
people saying hello

519
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,399
endlessly or nothing hello Eric hello

520
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:59,639
hello how the kids hi hi hi hello hello
hello

521
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,250
island which is just I mean it's a
little terrified us like

522
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:09,299
anyway it's crazy it's absolutely crazy
it's very strange but

523
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,950
this guy

524
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,679
has digitized more newspaper pages

525
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,450
then any major private database he's
these days more private more newspaper

526
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,330
pages

527
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,250
then I governor me a an archive I

528
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,409
the National Archives project to do the
same vector this guy

529
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:32,779
working by himself has recovered more

530
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:35,919
old newspapers they need these other
people so

531
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,600
whether or not his web design skills are

532
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,939
eclectic it he added he is providing

533
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,399
I am an absolutely amazing service

534
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:51,870
now is primarily in New York State but
he's been branching out in recent years

535
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,529
I am EV the

536
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:59,970
abilities that he is added in here with
his icrc everything is a CRT sorts of

537
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,140
full-text searching

538
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,010
it's not just pages I let's look for
something really specific here

539
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,890
I am I will look forward

540
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:16,610
Hobbs Charles pissed

541
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:23,610
ok

542
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,080
this this part is often painful

543
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,080
she said I one sec

544
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,549
Iraq

545
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:50,549
up

546
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,580
so for the search all I'd look towards
patton lauck just to see what we can

547
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,399
come up with

548
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,600
I hopefully when I'm gonna be fighting
in here is an old advertisement for a

549
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,600
I 1874 here pat neal caskets

550
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,650
hearth and home billiards tables

551
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:26,650
Press maker earns I'll you know what

552
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,730
the needle casket has a padlock
attachment

553
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,570
class is that for padlock manufacturer
but you get the idea I'm going to move

554
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:35,919
on

555
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,810
at the basic idea is that full-time
history is an absolutely amazing

556
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,520
resource that is not the easiest to work
with but with full-text search

557
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,770
the billionth download pdf absolutely
everything the you're looking at

558
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,370
completely unlimited queries it's just
you go and you can spend days and days

559
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,020
doing this

560
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,420
and he has more pages than anybody else
he has more pages in many the

561
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,680
commercials put together

562
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,870
that said he does everything the
commercials have something to talk about

563
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,330
that

564
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,840
as well RXL I

565
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,870
I've talked a lot about volunteerism
center center so I have people

566
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,870
transcribing right now that I have two
other people transcribing and myself I'm

567
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,800
actually not looking for any other
transcription help unless people want to

568
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,470
review the work that's already been done

569
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,110
to be very helpful having a fresh set of
eyes or something three people were 10

570
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,510
said

571
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,590
I have no idea what that says would be
great but as far as the info

572
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,810
transcriptions this point burr covered
for now I just don't want it spread my

573
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,320
time at retailer citing things

574
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,379
to the people that are doing other
people's work I

575
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,200
fellow researchers though I have one
person right now that I think is about

576
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,240
to jump in to cover one of the names

577
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,440
because he was doing some database
searching for me

578
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,840
I am with some subscription archives to
the ad it was very frustrating sicken

579
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,330
find anything and CC BY didn't want to
come back to you with nothing so I dug

580
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,860
into the southern database a Texas to

581
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,469
and I found this guy's name as a

582
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,290
as sort of a landmark for a piece of
property in all the needed

583
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,310
here's his names as mean anything to you
and as it turned out this

584
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,350
tiny tiny little insubstantial his
information

585
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,909
was my second confirming document
telling you where this guy but I haven't

586
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,730
spent much time on yet lived

587
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,730
and not only where he lived because as
part of a deed agreement I can pretty

588
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,660
much narrow down exactly the lake

589
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,160
Street what i've landed center that this
guy lived on now

590
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,780
and because it matches up with what I
was looking at previously I now know for

591
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,460
certain it's my guy I know for certain
this guy is from my home state

592
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,890
and not terribly far away from me it was
really exciting to take these

593
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,810
informations get thought was nothing

594
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,060
the only look for because he was
frustrated at having found nothing

595
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,639
is hopefully going to be the first other
number as just a a landslide information

596
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,030
about

597
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,760
this guy I'm able to find anything else
about yet and that's the other thing is

598
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,650
that every time you find a little bit of
information

599
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,960
the doesn't seem like it's important
about the fig you were looking for

600
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,110
but struck my genealogy you look at the
census record

601
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,229
ensure now mean we know the name of the
house that he wasn't

602
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,450
the address great but we also have

603
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,320
other members of his family we have
other people that lived in that house

604
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,800
may be able to clearly are members of
the family better

605
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,570
but had been living there and we just
have a new block in search terms

606
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,850
the may at some point have some
ancillary relationship to our primary

607
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,509
subject

608
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:19,389
I'll be able to give us a lot more
information about that this is just

609
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,720
I really can't emphasize enough how
boring a lot of this is

610
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,480
yeah it is just us log researching from
point

611
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,850
two points to idea to idea to idea I'm
and without soda row to keep it all

612
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,168
manageable and know that you're not
covering the same base is over and over

613
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:37,049
and over again

614
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,700
aids it's miserable this is the sort of
work they've done on my own for years

615
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,239
now

616
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,290
and it will go back two months later and
say oh

617
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,129
man Pascale was super clever you figured
something really cool out

618
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,219
that he took no notes about I don't know
where he felt that

619
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:55,600
but it sure sounds great and whatever
else is or has been a blessing for all

620
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,089
this

621
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,890
i digress. a fellow researchers I would
actually love this and I would love more

622
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,540
of this

623
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,880
really the site is simple it says right
there all I am going to do is give you a

624
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,650
name

625
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,910
and a patent number: for one of these
people

626
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:15,629
there few dozen right now and your
entire life goal for some Spanish times

627
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,230
just to find as much information as you
can

628
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,109
that might be related to that person
right now all this is a data dump this

629
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:26,390
project is going to happen in several
stages will talk about that later

630
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,710
but next up is curation next up is
taking all the information I and anybody

631
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,440
else there helping with the project have
failed

632
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,859
and curated down into usable information
I

633
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:38,970
along the way the goal is to lose
nothing except for things that aren't

634
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,609
accurate

635
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:43,310
where they're going to be false
positives there are a lot of people with

636
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,470
the name James Kyle there a lot of
people some with a similar name

637
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,589
there are all that many Abraham lawyers
Stansbury is thankfully

638
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:54,010
I am but there are a lot of fairly
common names list were gonna get a lot

639
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,350
of false positives and those are the
only things you want to pull out

640
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,529
permanently

641
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,820
I both talk about all that the curation
process later

642
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,200
academic resources consistent access to
JSTOR would be amazing I've never been

643
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,980
to college

644
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,600
I'd probably won't go to college I A

645
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,750
I Gregory yeah

646
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,870
I I am presently also a barista

647
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:20,759
my fiance and I both without caffeine
power couple separated in the rock

648
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,180
gotta jittery makeout sessions I am

649
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,649
now action I am

650
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,109
the University of Vermont as part of
their mission to the state and the

651
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,460
citizens of the state

652
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,609
provide all the academic resources at
the University from out library to any

653
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,630
citizen whether not to go to your VM

654
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,680
check think is awesome and I wish happen
more often but what it means for me is

655
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,279
that I can roll into UVM

656
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,140
and I can spend the day digging through
J story digging through all of their

657
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,220
access to various journals

658
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,299
other libraries centered Center their
own I found some phenomenal information

659
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,970
in their actual private paper records
that led me to some new leads on some

660
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,669
the different

661
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,230
inventors I am it's a phenomenal

662
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,020
phenomenal thing but going in to spend
the day

663
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,660
at UVM is becoming harder and harder for
me as I'm hopefully transitioning into a

664
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,850
real job again

665
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,750
as I'm trying to keep track of the other
parts this project and so on so forth

666
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,880
being able to do some these things from
the privacy my own homes phenomenal and

667
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,940
to that end

668
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,240
I had at least one person now provide me
some

669
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,839
JSTOR access via them don't just let me
send him things to look into and not

670
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,180
shoot me

671
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,960
thank you and there should be a budget
PDS for me defending Syrian security

672
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,510
information at a

673
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,690
any academic affiliation would be
amazing

674
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,320
I'm very proud to have recently been
named a research scholar at the road

675
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,290
Institute

676
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:47,560
their 501 c3 to provide independent but
provide

677
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,049
I institutional backing to independent
academics

678
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,410
most of the people that are involved in
this have been the college back there

679
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,980
professors they have doctorates are not

680
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,920
with the ratings news let me do right
now is put their name down in the

681
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,609
institution feel for grants and four

682
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:06,660
papers that I'm submitting to more
academic conferences and so on and so

683
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,370
forth

684
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,819
that said I don't actually have the
academic resources

685
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,240
up an institution of higher learning
behind me in behind this project

686
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,419
if you are in that position of you know
somebody in that position allow us to

687
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,710
bring the way to school behind this

688
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,310
that could potentially be amazing for
this I am

689
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,460
and give us access to a lot more
information I privately have access to

690
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,620
right now

691
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,250
I am and subscriptions archives and
mention passing a couple times but if

692
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,359
you have a subscription

693
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,240
for genealogy Bay newspaper archive full
three and sister dot com

694
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,629
any of those places any other paid
genealogy history newspaper archives say

695
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,890
would be amazing if you'd be willing to
run down some search queries for us

696
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,890
even a few week few a month one ever

697
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,589
anything would be amazing and okay

698
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:57,000
sup I get back to you with the camels I
said they would get back to the pies I'm

699
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,150
going to cover both those about five
minutes

700
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,600
the party is I don't have a lot
information was under a database right

701
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,440
now but it's the pies they got me
interested this to begin with

702
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,930
and this is past Skyler this is Kayla
the didn't take good notes this is

703
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,669
Skyler

704
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,359
that was to be perfectly honest and some
people Israel I'm sure already where

705
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:14,859
this

706
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:19,170
this is passcode that was crazy enough
to the end up in a mental institution

707
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,960
and I was doing some of the best work in
my life when I was this crazy and I'm

708
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,700
trying to use same row instead of
praising us to be able to maintain it

709
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,950
and it seems to be going really well but
looking back on this is what got me very

710
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,020
excited because

711
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,310
the pie is in the way leads were to have
the names that we have

712
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,600
I was able to find a tenant information
about I was able to tell the story up

713
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,790
this family of these two families

714
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:45,320
there what america's first locksmithing
unlock making families but Ben

715
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,490
as best I can tell completely forgot
about

716
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,839
there are a couple of pipe and railroad
locks kicking around

717
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,089
in all collectors collections but this
story

718
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,529
to the best of my knowledge there been
told this is an unpublished essay that

719
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,140
well

720
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,910
eventually published they've been a bit
maybe it's something else but i just

721
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,529
wondering be our last paragraph here

722
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,470
basically this turned out to be two
incredibly interesting families that

723
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,310
made amazing locks they won medals for
their locks but

724
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,759
their buildings burned down they

725
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,380
didn't make the newest paper block the
carried over old British tradition since

726
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,920
the switching over to some new American
traditions

727
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,520
they didn't pick rapidly their children
stopped being interested in the business

728
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,630
for one reason or another

729
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,760
after four generations and trying to
make it work they just completely faded

730
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,870
into history

731
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:39,100
and never heard from again we can tell
for generations and the wife misty

732
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,580
families here

733
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,060
I conclude with while it's easy to
recognize the visionaries I find myself

734
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,730
fascinated by the stories

735
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:50,470
generations a block makers who toiled in
relative obscurity

736
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,140
working hard to imagine the art forward
they just happen to be working in a

737
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,560
moment that was filled with rapid Bolden
public innovation

738
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,220
and as a result their master works were
left in the dust history

739
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,359
and that's the not have the whole
project for me and I said this several

740
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,970
times but

741
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:12,040
a gonna go back to the camels one more
time here

742
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:18,290
so the cable have a very looked at we
look at the full text transcription

743
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:22,620
I started taking the patents that we
have images for

744
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,569
and just started building vectors after
them in Illustrator

745
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,980
in and you know eventually I end up with
something

746
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,890
it looks like this and this is Russ Bee
Gees I can then bring into blender

747
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:41,009
and I can actually build up 3d models
and 3d animations and these locks

748
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:45,930
and using tools that work with Blender
or using other stuff rather than blender

749
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,259
we can actually 3d print these locks

750
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,510
and i've a mini mill in my home so I can
build these at brass and Greece

751
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,910
again as they were meant to be made

752
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,319
and I tell you there's been nothing more
exciting

753
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,670
in my career picking locks researching
locks

754
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,390
speaking in anything I've done in my
life

755
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:12,940
then holding a tangible are defective
lost genius in my hand

756
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:18,180
the I and if you help me

757
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,740
even if you just watch encouraging tell
other people about it will have more and

758
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,529
more these artifacts in their hands

759
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,339
we're going to dredge up the masterworks

760
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:31,930
up makers that have been completely
forgotten

761
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,299
and hopefully some day when all of us
are dead some will do the same thing for

762
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,339
us

763
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:41,029
X dot lauck but she d

764
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,810
this is my new life come help me out

765
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:51,810
thank you very much thanks

766
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,820
I think they might still have a better
to for questions if there are any

767
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,600
questions

768
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,860
yes tech your editor

769
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,010
law the practices

770
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:09,560
we have on yes I'm so the question is if
I told lock

771
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,610
will you often see pat markings on them
I am yes

772
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:17,070
to a degree at the very least you
usually see the word patent

773
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:21,820
and during this time the idea of having
a patent walk

774
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,210
was almost synonymous with help people
now think about how we better get a

775
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:25,750
dental

776
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,850
I'm this the same ID or patent lakh lakh
was just a buzzword for better security

777
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,230
around the block

778
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,100
so the very least it should say patent
on it whether that'll have any number

779
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,029
associated with it

780
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,130
but even just that would be a great from

781
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,590
I mean having that on the physical
artifacts would be agreed

782
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:46,060
I have way to get started digging deeper
into that particular patent

783
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,290
there are people out there that know a
lot more about all the locks that I do

784
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,060
I have the pleasure of speaking at the
Lancaster lock show in several weeks

785
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,770
where it is just hardcore antique clock
collectors and it is a very different

786
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,300
audience table in front before

787
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,930
going to talk about this project a
couple other things island I'm very

788
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,049
excited to have those guys because those
are the serb people are bringing its a

789
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,760
man walked somebody that it's a

790
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,950
all right what's gone on this one
restart because they're there's still

791
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:11,740
some great

792
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:18,089
collected information out there I

793
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,460
so I have I have not yet machine the
Campbells lock at a press

794
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,970
I have machine blocks out a brass before
I am

795
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:28,020
the first time I ever tried to do it it
was terrible

796
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,150
what pouring it took a very long time it
didn't work and I threw it away

797
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,750
why don't relieve stress I am breast
costs a lot still

798
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:41,300
I be be only other time I've attempted
to actually made a very simple lever

799
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,060
lock very small simple lever lock at the
plate brass

800
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,680
it took me about three days I would
guess there's working between four and

801
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,970
eight hours each day

802
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:52,870
I also didn't have a great sense of what
I was doing but is each one of these

803
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:53,970
locks will be unique

804
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,980
and more more complex than a very simple
thing they work to

805
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,400
when it comes time to actually make that
a brass I

806
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,690
don't have a great estimate for how long
it'll take me but i wanna laser cut

807
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,980
things I want three different things but
at some point I'm I walked

808
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,480
the machined brass released

809
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,810
Springs et cetera because and I said
I've said it many toxins like it makes

810
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:19,490
me but the smell a brass increases
invigorating to me

811
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:25,399
just in love itself it it is by another

812
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,330
back yes miles

813
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,620
yes I and that's a great question

814
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,770
in a good point I don't mention this
model the before the patent office

815
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,450
burned

816
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:41,089
every patent those submitted have to
have had to have a model submitted with

817
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:41,410
it

818
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:46,660
unfortunately we lost all the models in
1836 in the 1877 fire we lost

819
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,960
a ton of the models again I am

820
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,240
I don't know the specific metal some
sometimes you just me that would just to

821
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,970
explain how the thing worked

822
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,870
I I don't have the specifics for how
anyone about our

823
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,520
forty-something locks were created in
the model

824
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,470
I don't have that information yes one

825
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,689
I most the back then were cast yes

826
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,120
yeah absolutely were and

827
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,480
yet Henry a lot iron the the main reason
that I want to be the man to brass and

828
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,040
on my

829
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,020
machine presently is because that's what
excites me

830
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,930
and it's a passion project anybody out
there wants to do actual like

831
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:34,460
casting torching et cetera they're
welcome too and i'll settle on

832
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,730
any plans limit myself as well that
would be awesome if there's a blacksmith

833
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,610
out at once again father would be crazy

834
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:44,830
be very cool here

835
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:49,200
here yes and his be a

836
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,419
movie review track

837
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,039
I the question is whether attracted many
of the families

838
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:59,119
I actually skipped over this just as
running low on time but yeah absolutely

839
00:46:59,119 --> 00:46:59,459
happy

840
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:02,739
I'm so these are the mini lease I

841
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:06,549
this mini league I we have no recovery
whatsoever anything from the patent

842
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:07,380
office this is

843
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,119
again most commonly the case I we have a
couple memoirs have people in his

844
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:12,969
family's

845
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:18,650
in his family we have I we know that he
was i think a soldier at one point I V

846
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,680
is part of the repeal Association we
have all these little tiny bits

847
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,969
biographical data

848
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:26,569
but it turns out who's from a very
famous Bell making family

849
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:30,160
and we have a little note in the journal
the franklin institute

850
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,690
that explains that the method it talks
briefly

851
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,799
about the the way that he was casting
his locks

852
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:42,219
and so immediately I'm wondering if
there's any connection to the Belfast

853
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:44,229
country because as well as family is a
multi

854
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:47,828
developing any method for casting locks
based on Dell works there a lot of walks

855
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:50,369
mister also Bell hears back then as it
turns out

856
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:53,630
I am so I got a hold over I

857
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,549
this gentleman who runs the nearly bill
online museum he is Emilie

858
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:01,279
sadly he's never got ahold he's never
got back to me with my increase

859
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:07,479
I am so I honestly I having other people
that are willing to go that extra mile

860
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:09,649
to get a hold of kind descendants

861
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,599
that would also be amazing primarily
because

862
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,199
reaching out to renders getting on the
phone with people

863
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,940
sending people emails cetera causes that
little bit anxious reaction ms I don't

864
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,469
do it very very often

865
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:26,839
I would love more people to pick up the
things that will push me away from the

866
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:27,430
project

867
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,979
like anxiety attacks I am so that would
be great and yes I have tried to reach

868
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:34,089
out and I will continue to try to reach
out

869
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:37,799
I'm getting personal papers to be an
amazing going to the project there's

870
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:39,959
something over here was something back
there

871
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,069
you doing it his the

872
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:46,900
his no I have not PBS show host

873
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,359
yet that's not a bad idea actually had

874
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:54,739
because this had been a personal passion
for a few months and the carried on from

875
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:57,829
my historical working doing for years
and only just now I made a public

876
00:48:57,829 --> 00:49:01,249
I i haven't even really thought about
who else I could

877
00:49:01,249 --> 00:49:05,238
who also them in a much more public way
I could try to rope in the bus

878
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:08,900
so it's a good idea something over here

879
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,259
okay all right thank you all so much

880
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:16,979
I A really appreciate it I'm actually
gonna go back to bed for an hour

881
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:21,038
and I'll be back down and was inducted
are you please tell me with any

882
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:22,900
questions in a release got all that

883
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,199
thank you well
