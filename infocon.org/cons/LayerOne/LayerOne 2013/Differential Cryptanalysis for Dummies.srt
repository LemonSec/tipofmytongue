1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,170
in

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,500
yes really like their

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,370
its work art adam said this is different
recap now houses for dummies

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,730
who my name is John

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,160
I am in the Navy although I'm not
speaking on behalf of the Navy

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,029
disclaimer is all my own stuff I hope I
find a lockpick village around that

7
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,300
effort I just got a gram

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,760
but I view of I'm you going to hold me
email whatever

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,649
than are the amazing King dot com is we
should go was also a crypto stuff on

10
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:36,890
there so on more than

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:42,280
just for the materials I we're going
over today is

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,300
differential cryptanalysis at a specific
technique that we use to attack modern

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:46,930
ciphers

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,730
com pretty much all modern kept now sis

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,680
involved in this basic attack so you can
understand how this works

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,690
you can go further among other tax in
you know really taken the crypto

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,989
I'm I want to just talk because

18
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:08,220
there's a huge difference between when
you go to crypto how to break it

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,130
you see classical cryptanalysis like you
know attack at dawn newsletters much

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,289
scrambling and stuff

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,290
and yacht you know if there's that and
then there's like a PhD math papers the

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,040
donors that

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,400
there's nothing to bridge the gap with
your child to hear um

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,580
the stock is academic in nature what I
mean by that is you're not going to walk

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,350
away and going to sum up and test

26
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,158
for example on way to build a scenario
and now we're gonna break the site for

27
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,390
instance scenario

28
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,350
it so it's all done in our code always
has public so there's no

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,658
obvious is no classified information but
you can go to disarm yourself in

30
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,140
and get off the internet are gonna stay
with a math

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,180
because those are enough written in that
and not talk among trial but Ryan

32
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,740
dumb it down a bit you know my language
I went to

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,850
algebra in high school that the extend
my former math education

34
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,000
rack I

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,489
before summer break the silence is a
fine what is a break we mean that we

36
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:09,560
broke a cyber

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,840
arm to do it by brute force

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,420
means you're testing every single
possible key you know the analogy is

39
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,589
your test the everything calm wanna safe
dial

40
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,750
and when you when you before break

41
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,050
when you break crypto you're trying to
find the key

42
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,569
in less computational efforts than
exhaustive search

43
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,488
so you don't wanna test everything okie
you are doing less work so

44
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,580
again the you now to the safe lock you
cured chest million combos

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,250
or you can take what the walk to how it
works fine the vulnerability and do a

46
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,480
hint that the combos

47
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,069
you're still doing work it's not instant
we're doing less work

48
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:55,379
and I'm the case about Dez goes from 2.3
years to one point six days if you apply

49
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,109
this attack

50
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,310
to that album right we're not attacking
does

51
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,739
there's been all sorts of stuff written
about does and how to break in how it

52
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:07,269
works

53
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,720
already got something you in these years
called %uh feel fast at insight in our

54
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,390
rhythm

55
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,799
alright it's pretty awesome estimates
from the 80's it was made as a

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,260
replacement for Dez

57
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,899
geron on less powerful hardware but it

58
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,209
it employs the same mom design
principles that

59
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,709
that does doesn't it another modern
block ciphers such a really really good

60
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,730
case study it's also bob with everything
by 12 never asked if the guy finds a new

61
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,369
attack you want to try it out

62
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,900
isn't have a cipher in mind they never
be dropped her feel

63
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,310
because they know it's gonna break it's
a cigarette stepchild of the

64
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,560
crypto world I'm not to worry about the
the specific service up there for your

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,580
reference are

66
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,260
I guess that we're building it we're
building a virtual system we're gonna

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,939
break it

68
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,109
um in this again this one we have

69
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,489
a sender and receiver there the centers
on the left the receivers in the right

70
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,159
they're gonna send plain text in 64-bit
blocks

71
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,010
to the receiver they send it to us in
crypt function that's for fuel for lives

72
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,069
is not box turns inside a text the
godmother and

73
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,409
D crib set and get the usual plain text
back on

74
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,250
this is a symmetric out for them which
means that both the sender and the

75
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,919
receiver are using the same key

76
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,008
the same team until to do this the way
it's supposed to be handled

77
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:32,440
is your four as a separate are in
polisci schedule you feed in

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,060
64 bit streaky it spits out six

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,509
32-bit sub keyser call so it expands
that gay and gives you more key material

80
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:42,100
to work with

81
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,479
arm for what we're doing here we don't
care about the Q schedule

82
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,740
arm if you can

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,430
if you look at ways diagrams done if you
can get the sub keys

84
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,650
then you're able to decrypt the
communications is that makes sense

85
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,520
you don't need the original key who
cares

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,590
the only thing you need is the subsidies
and it turns out 630 see what's up keys

87
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,929
is actually harder than 1 64 bit key we
we should be I should make sense

88
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,930
but to do the basic versions the tack it
makes more sense to simplify it down

89
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,699
alright the way we're going to do this
reduces colic difference between also

90
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,979
chosen plaintext attack

91
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,539
arm we think operating crypto

92
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,780
la people imagine okay I'm gonna catch
the cipher text

93
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,150
and just using that I'm and get the key

94
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,508
and that is one way to do it but that s
that assumes a a week attacker

95
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:43,870
in the academic world they allow for
stronger attack

96
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,710
II attack on models and this one is
chosen plaintext

97
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,320
the ideas that we have a an adversary
rights aids

98
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,569
I'll China North Korea Russia and it's a
pic 1

99
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,300
I don't care arm they're using that
cryptosystem

100
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,259
right there we'll get the key so we
break in their facility

101
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,490
we steal the encryption device and we

102
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,319
we get to hold it for I'm not sad day
for the rust off

103
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,960
might be 10 minutes but the point is
that we have captured this encryption

104
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,080
device

105
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,630
and we want to figure out what the keys
are stored inside it

106
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,850
below the keys n and you can't get them
out

107
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,940
it's like at that the idea that it's a
tamper-proof box

108
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,350
which if you don't have a contest should
be a little funny

109
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,910
arm so we can do is me can shoot some
plain text

110
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,660
send in the box and get the resulting
cipher text out

111
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,870
and by doing that over and over again
you know in deliver away

112
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,889
we can get the sub keys and we can go
break break the code being used in the

113
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,940
real world

114
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,800
the other three box that makes
everything is rinsed and

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,319
waste on this the overview how intact
works on

116
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,880
don't worry if you don't understand it
right now but is to give you a IR

117
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,440
context

118
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,940
because we're about the weight even in
the nuts and bolts in the guts the stuff

119
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,520
this candidate is just the overview
pomegranate juice in plain text

120
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,280
that has particular trait called a
differential

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,250
transcended in the box we can get the
resulting cipher text out the bottom

122
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,660
we're going to partially d cryptid while
guessing the last subkey

123
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,710
and we're going to get a resume or
resulting up

124
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,299
resulting text a legacy that matches a
predicted

125
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,289
output differential

126
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,610
as I will win revisit this in a min in
your in my make more sense but

127
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,669
that the idea we're done zoomed out

128
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,109
or other way to look at it with pretty
three boxes to make it any easier

129
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,819
I'm gonna set which is plain text with
the differential withdrawn in this box

130
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,530
that he stole

131
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,250
and every cent in or into our round for
detection device we get a subkey

132
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:06,250
enemy verify the top a difference we get
matches will be protected

133
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,460
alright this is on did not get a little
more in depth about what I mean by this

134
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,948
stuff

135
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,319
on differentials are if you have two
numbers in this case

136
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,240
x0 next one the differential or Delta X

137
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,710
those two numbers that come in pairs is

138
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,840
x0 X or with x1

139
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,739
exhorts or exclusive or math not
operation

140
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,580
popular firmly with tax or have used to
encode awesome

141
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,740
art then you then that the election make
sense

142
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,630
arm Delta dull tax has ones

143
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,789
in the positions where the bits changed
between the two

144
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,480
between x0 x1 so we do is we choose
plain text

145
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,680
such that they satisfy this differential
they have this property

146
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,630
so we pick a random number we X or with
an input differential

147
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,689
we don't know what that is you know what
we're going to how you find that

148
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,459
probably extra with the simple
differential and we get the second

149
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,768
happen the pair

150
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:08,490
and then we send both of them into the
encryption device

151
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,110
on the other end we have reading
differential subjected them so far

152
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,130
now we get two numbers out

153
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,640
we just exxon together we get the
differential and this will we see that

154
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,640
match the prediction

155
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,300
speaking at predicting differentials

156
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,609
arm whenever you send numbers to a
function

157
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,740
on through to a block it does some
transformation to them

158
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,920
part aside from this case you send both
these numbers x0 x1

159
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,229
through through the function you
excellent beginning

160
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,680
and you see what the input differential
is and the properties at that function

161
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,859
if it's week is not cryptographically
secure you can predict

162
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,390
what the output differential is going to
be

163
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,290
are you don't care about them done
numbers themselves all you care about

164
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,050
this property:

165
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,099
so as these numbers travel to decipher

166
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,430
you know out there in space is this
office differential traveling with them

167
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,130
so I think about it

168
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,610
it's just the property if these two
numbers during a pair

169
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,029
so in this case we have a two run two
French a characteristic if we

170
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,260
if we inject two numbers the
differential 3

171
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,279
when it gets past that first function

172
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,550
the differential be in not we don't want
numbers going or are we note

173
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,370
differentials

174
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,880
then it goes to the the function again
and it gives a differential to

175
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,579
this is this just an example

176
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:39,870
so again I would have a little bit
account explodes means

177
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,950
we're going to inject numbers in pairs
or inject blocks in pairs

178
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,110
that have this input differential

179
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,070
it goes to the first three rounds

180
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,820
any and it gives us it should be the
predicted output differential

181
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,019
whatever that was a number that happens
to be

182
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,610
get the resulting hypertext we d cryptid

183
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,120
but not all the way we do cryptic based
on guess that we make it the last round

184
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,899
subkey

185
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,589
and we get a pair of numbers we get
their difference we need to be needed

186
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,029
and we see that matches the prediction
if it does

187
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:21,160
the subkey we use to make that guess it
gets a point

188
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,880
its score goes up if you do this over
and over again

189
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,450
the correct subkey will emerge

190
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,060
alright now we're going to go way down
to NC how we built this prediction

191
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,109
I keep talking about you know mean check
differential them predict what's going

192
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,839
to be

193
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,709
but how do you do that this is how the
puzzling aspect about

194
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:47,050
a break in crypto in are at the lowest
level the cipher

195
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,589
operates using that they called the G
box in the

196
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:53,660
and specifications what it is

197
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,730
it's a function that has two inputs to
both aight thats

198
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,870
there too types have G boxes two flavors

199
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,180
there's g0 and g1 the only difference is
that that

200
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,089
X on the left on the left to the

201
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:13,519
that squares addition by the way mishap
retirees write this stuff

202
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,089
so the first thing that happens if this
is the g0 box for instance

203
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,500
the input one come from input to comes
in they get added together

204
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,329
and means you'll get out to it so no
effect

205
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,649
so this labor addition but it's bound to
a bit so if it carries make it going to

206
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,310
9 bids

207
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,680
just drop some of it is truncated arm

208
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,579
after that it goes into a bitwise
rotation

209
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:42,479
it's very important that the the rice is
that wise rotation and not shifting

210
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,019
other leisure coat will not work arm
just all those rotate in this case too

211
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:48,730
but still after to bed

212
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,610
to bits toward the most significant bit

213
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,139
and then spits out the naam a bit output

214
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:01,160
and it was she wanted to be exact same
thing but that X would be a one

215
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,240
and add that to it they do the G box

216
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,450
study how it works because we're gonna
were about to break it

217
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,510
arm it is not this the only source of
what's gone on here :d

218
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,480
this is like their defense again script
and houses the stupid box

219
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,690
and this this might be it is how you
predict a differential

220
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,529
going through it was your child to a
building a chain of predictions that we

221
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,730
can do for attack

222
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,660
I'm I saw that addition and that that
was what a shower Mike

223
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,870
I don't wanna see her actually analyze
how was work some like what differences

224
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,970
were matter

225
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,870
so I just brute force that arm I tried
every possible

226
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,480
hair simple once every possible care
numbers they can try and pull one

227
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,339
every possible parenting don't input to
and that tried

228
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:56,519
X UX been 01 so g0 judges your box and
you want but to tell them both

229
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,209
and that's recorded like what what what
the differential I'm able one

230
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,388
what's different on part two and what's
the resulting output differential

231
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:08,470
what happens when you X or the results
together at the end when you get

232
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,899
and there were two properties that that
help through

233
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,769
to differential characteristics that
always hold this she box

234
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,870
the first one the first one arm its it's
a pretty obvious what happened

235
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,949
every function every deterministic
function

236
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:29,880
if you have an input differential 0 an
input differentials euro

237
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,769
you're going to get an update from
sub-zero the reason why that is

238
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,910
is because you're not making any changes
the first half that pair

239
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,010
you feel it is some some numbers

240
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,360
in the second half is the exact same
numbers she didn't get that done at the

241
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,760
local

242
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,959
up without so thats that is why

243
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,349
any 0 and the differential is going to
give you 80 up a differential

244
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,990
I the second one is the effective on or
after

245
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,850
arm this the the Sun had some I'm sure
you guys figure that out

246
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,540
arm either import one or input to

247
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,279
can be eighty if the other input is zero

248
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,110
then we get this up a differential love
to

249
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,959
on the reason why that is when you do
the addition

250
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,719
if you do that addition and you change a
bit anywhere in the middle

251
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,240
about the bite then there could be a
carry its gonna scrub

252
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,850
other bits but if you do it in the most
significant bit

253
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,940
about bite if there's a carry

254
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,079
it just gets chopped off and then gets
rotate about you better turn them

255
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,750
different from zero to

256
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,339
but I didn't get out at first I just
brute force that

257
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,630
got there isn't there a dollar access to
take away from this line is that those

258
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,689
the two

259
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:53,690
characteristics I love this block the
shoebox

260
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,750
the results will have her g box works is
because using the f-box

261
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,850
arm the Sox care promises not

262
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,570
we can use we just learned to beat this
thing and protect differentials going

263
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,920
through it

264
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,599
are the first alarm the the first arm
difference a week after this the

265
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,690
characteristic is

266
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,029
if you feed it an input differential 0
you can get help a differential 0

267
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:24,880
because nothing changed however

268
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,480
we can use those G those dumb jukebox
difference we found

269
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,820
they did to the two and we can when we
can

270
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,899
build another one who is not only a
partial to the a box

271
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,279
looking the other top left get a
kirscher

272
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,699
here unsettling are

273
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:47,170
we have this bike is eighty this pie is
eighty

274
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,199
if you it is all circles with the pluses
in them

275
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:54,880
rx or

276
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,029
a member on by I'm sure you guys know
that you actually the same number with

277
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,000
itself get zero out

278
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,119
that also works with differentials these
are not numbers being fed into those

279
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,000
boxes are

280
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,160
he's a differentials I'll pairs of
numbers

281
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,400
they were tracking and one other
properties attacks or is that

282
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,030
if you feed it to stay on two different
or the same you get zero out

283
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,020
just what's your comes from a doze in
the g1 right there

284
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,959
on the right side we have 0n0 these two
bites

285
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,010
they get there they collect or become 0

286
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,299
and you can see that is your skis keep
zeroing out

287
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,520
but the tricky part over here eighty

288
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,889
with zero uses that difference we found
earlier

289
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,270
eighty 10 into a G box gives us two

290
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,570
the Opera differential

291
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,659
and this characteristic is enough to
break the cyber

292
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,530
and we can show how to do that right now

293
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,889
i'd you knows we haven't talked about
keys anywhere we've been seeing these

294
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,549
functions that just does move it around

295
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,700
we had talked about how the sub he's get
mixed in yo where's the security

296
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,370
arm don't the way that the way that
works is that the keys

297
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,729
is almost universal block ciphers the
key gets excellent somewhere

298
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,480
and it's the same and feel so we have

299
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,980
and if a differential 288 Islami found

300
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,100
right there look at the top eighty
eighty 00

301
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,129
it comes in to the X or

302
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,070
the skate 3 is a subkey it's it's it's
one of those 632 but some keys to be

303
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,580
there be found that we are

304
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,240
wertheimer earlier arm keys are
interesting because

305
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,990
they have a differential up zero

306
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,940
in when you have these pairs a
plain-text the young Krypton

307
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,570
and that carry differential the
relationship between the months ago the

308
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,889
cipher

309
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,309
the keys don't change so if I send this

310
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,960
this one to the point X through I'm
cryptid you know

311
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,289
that I sent the next up i text
transcript it the keys didn't change

312
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,179
between those two operations

313
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,350
because the keys didn't change them

314
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,879
cheese have an input differential 0

315
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,000
so it goes in the X or

316
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,120
and eighty 80 X 40 is 8080

317
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,539
it goes to the goes to the ER the f-box

318
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:28,750
and give us the Purdue the opposite
French or two

319
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,840
that's the whole thing arm

320
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,299
so again the way we do this we inject
and put differential beginning

321
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:43,139
I mean we predicted at the input the
last round

322
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,480
is %uh the whole thing flows arm

323
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,740
at the beginning we just send an at-at
an at-at

324
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,860
the first to Suki's mix in with zeros

325
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,370
but it doesn't acted because the
difference as heroes so just go straight

326
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,340
through

327
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,639
these two different guys were together
produces zero

328
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,620
comes through here at the output we end
up with zero on the left an ATA yung

329
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,539
right

330
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,570
this this part of this lil bit up here
on the right is our think about your

331
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,178
toolbox

332
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:20,240
it's where you can use to build the spot

333
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,650
is the options available to you for
going to be a box

334
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,600
on the first round we use 2020

335
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,389
on Round two we have here on the left
ATM right

336
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,200
again the sub keys don't matter they
carry input did make a difference of 0

337
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,970
so we get 8080 going into the f-box

338
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,039
remember this difference a
characteristic up your 8080

339
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,520
always turns into and is 0-2

340
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,350
I'm easy as that is such as we get out
the f-box

341
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,530
and it carries down crosses over and we
end up with a be on the left

342
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,980
into one right

343
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,110
Mizrahi gets kinda weird this is the
around three

344
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,760
we have this the this ADA hits the X or

345
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,879
on the right we have this differential
to

346
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,010
get gets exhort with zero from this from
the subkey

347
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,650
so it's still too going into the going
into the

348
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,150
the other round function we don't have a
prediction

349
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,190
for a free giffgaff box differential to

350
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,720
all we know how to do all we can predict
is 8080

351
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,179
wanted to and you're going to zero we
don't know

352
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:38,990
what the differentials going to be
coming out this app box

353
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,559
and that's fine so I unknown unknown

354
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,580
but on the left the Stooges carry-over
and that's a that's what I use that the

355
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,629
final prediction

356
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,720
they were looking for

357
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,350
alright so we have when we inject that
original

358
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,189
differential 8080 8080 the

359
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,679
end result of all this dollars diagram
tracing is that we end up with this

360
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,650
output differential up to

361
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,049
no matter what the sub keys don't affect
it

362
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:15,918
nothing nothing can change is this is
the property of the cyber because it's

363
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,570
week

364
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,299
we end up with just two coming into the
input last round

365
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,570
on the right we don't know the
difference was we don't care

366
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,830
I would get the ciphertext out of the
box install

367
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,840
we can just trace back

368
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,199
with the numbers themselves the actual
para numbers you get out the end

369
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,070
and we calculate until we get to see

370
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,450
on the way with gas the subkey sk3

371
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,750
wished we you can start 0 and sand and
sea and see if this works out

372
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,500
then you gotta 1234 just trial mall

373
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,530
you send it he said the result through
the f-box

374
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,260
into this acts or UX or with the left
side as hypertext

375
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,700
and you get see she is this is Parag
numbers but even

376
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,480
you can't racing through you calculate
their differences

377
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,169
used actually gather in if that Delta
see

378
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:19,610
is he called to then there's a good
chance that that Kate three you

379
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,408
guess was correct

380
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:30,409
national suit on the right

381
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:34,480
eyes again little bit more more assumed
out you

382
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,210
so we choose that plain text with those
differences I i showed 80 80 80 80

383
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,580
it goes through the first three rounds

384
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,070
and because the problem is the site for
the the viability

385
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,270
we can predict it's going to be to

386
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,320
at the and around three to take the
cipher text

387
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,860
we partially cryptid law guessing

388
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,860
the key that goes in this round 4 and we
see if it matches

389
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,939
we explore the two numbers show the pair
matches that too

390
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,350
if it does the keys pyrite

391
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,289
so that a break the last round if you
can write some code to make that work

392
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,549
you're almost done with you you've
broken the site for you win

393
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,600
put off going to the whole thing Indian
get the whole key out

394
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,100
yeah I do a little bit more that's the
same idea

395
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,279
you start with what we have to talk to
new differential

396
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,700
because you want to fall apart at the
input to the last round young cracked

397
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,990
yet

398
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,510
you don't wanna predict differentials in
cipher text you want to go

399
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,850
random at the last minute is that that
that that that makes the out the process

400
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,080
so that doesn't keys and testing them

401
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,539
DOMA more random us what you want

402
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,129
so we do is bloody crackdown for

403
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,110
we guess the skinny skinny sub he's

404
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,649
with check for the differential if it's
right we

405
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,659
we give that he'll help us one

406
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,270
until we get so now we have the last
round subkey

407
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,690
so we just d cryptid

408
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,860
enemy turkey the possum possum round
three

409
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,649
we predict a differential that goes from
the chosen plaintext

410
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,809
three rounds 1&2 and into the import
around to this time

411
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,350
guess the subkey there and we see that
matches

412
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,199
if it does and that that that's around
three sup cutie I'll be tracked

413
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,409
repeat until we get it

414
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:41,419
round two we do the exact same thing you
have to use

415
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:45,190
if you look at the other differentials
to go through here

416
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,240
80 80 80 80 those 22 knows we use

417
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,380
0 8080 does the two we have to modify
our approach that the

418
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,690
so that this this differential
protection falls apart at the end

419
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:06,270
move around too with all the different
but same idea

420
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,760
getting round one is tough arm

421
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,940
it's more straightforward all you all
you have to do

422
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,480
mistake gases at k0 and calculate

423
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,830
k4 k5 you use

424
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,129
because you chose the plain text you
have that data you can use it

425
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,470
to get to get the zombies numbers but I

426
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,090
if you get if you get enough case you
okay forty-five degrees each other

427
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,740
the correct

428
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,429
I keep saying you know where been were
feeling and what she was in pairs a

429
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,929
plain text

430
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:42,700
and that we're guessing he's you know
how much data we actually talking about

431
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,470
to get

432
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,970
ok to get a good sub key emerging though
he actually excited

433
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,370
arm this is i Iran II did a hundred a
rations this

434
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,080
per hour per number chosen plaintext
pairs

435
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,678
so if you just be that one pair plain
text and try and get the key

436
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,279
it's not gonna work your purse at but as
you are more does up an environment that

437
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,940
12 or 13 pairs mark

438
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,840
you get our percent success is always a
very remote possibility it won't work

439
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,830
was what the demos probably going to
expose

440
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,199
mom to give an idea scale if you to do
this

441
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,130
a brute force the sahara Knite to be key
or 630 what's up keys

442
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,840
that song would take you as a lot

443
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,840
arm but we do the attack

444
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:46,409
this takes a minute but not that long

445
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,480
that's right 15 seconds

446
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,610
I what's done is it's using 12 chosen
plaintext pairs

447
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,699
with that input differential 80 80 80 80
is predicting an output differential to

448
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,570
going into the input the last round and
its testing Suki's

449
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,049
and see if they match that predicted up
a differential

450
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:16,879
and then it goes round three

451
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,539
it did crips using what's found so far
and their peace the process for him for

452
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,230
for the %uh the inputs around three

453
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:31,230
now just in the last little bit so the
other key

454
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,690
with that

455
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,730
are so it found it good work good works
offer

456
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,540
but I so well

457
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,870
58 seconds it's pretty good compared to

458
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:56,270
you know that are

459
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:03,270
that is the the basics that hard work so
I know I sped through it

460
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,070
by Tom if if you get in the mood to the
Q&A

461
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,159
wouldn't be able to up figure out what
that make sense my rambling

462
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,290
and hopefully a good understanding
re-arm

463
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:23,290
they have questions what's up if this
I've had more rounds with that pressure

464
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,190
the attack

465
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,950
it would because see

466
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,740
to dislike for yet so we just tacked on
more rounds

467
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,320
what would happen is that we have to
find a differential

468
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,500
a path do that Sypher that we could keep
predicting

469
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,840
until we got the end it if you can't
find one of those

470
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,919
them the mustard arm in this case

471
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,890
you can't go past of your 40 can go past
four rounds

472
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,710
with the 100 percent probability in this
case

473
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,970
that characteristic that 8080 goes to to
thank

474
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,780
that happens every single time her purse
at there's no

475
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,040
probability involved arm with not with

476
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,080
other differential attacks what they
want and as

477
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,169
instead of being a 100 percent chance
that that characteristic is going to

478
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:13,730
happen

479
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,270
there's it's a possibility it's a chance
a chance

480
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,730
and if that chance is higher then with
and what you would normally protect

481
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,050
then you can use that but it takes a lot
more data

482
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,740
that whole fiend 12 pairs into it and
getting did not a word

483
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,070
wouldn't happen it it's like you get to
feel it tens of thousands a plain text

484
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,520
to get to converge on pretty arm

485
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,150
however adding more rounds as always
work thing for that

486
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,770
there is an attack policy slide attack
arm

487
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:49,090
that this is Kat is have one other
Picasa just one run

488
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,250
if we just had more rounds that makes
cybersecurity Maharshi the rounds are

489
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,790
are it turns out you can do that arm

490
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,428
if you with a slight attack what you're
looking for

491
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:04,220
is two sets of a plain text in
cyberattacks

492
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,490
that dont decipher and just had this
happen

493
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,220
such that p1 is the output around one

494
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,450
for p0 and the way you can find this is

495
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:21,030
you examine every pair cipher text and
you

496
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,270
you used yet their corresponding c0

497
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,460
and you can you get in you use them
together to get

498
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,950
AR around key to get a sub curator it's
really easy to break one rounded

499
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,910
have the plain text you have the cipher
text you know it is it allows you to do

500
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,230
that especially the Browns week

501
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,020
if you get you need a key out there you
encrypt

502
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,790
p0 with that key for one round and see
that matches p1

503
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,560
if it did when you have a sleep pair and
you know the key the key is right

504
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,970
arm I have an exam on the website

505
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:57,130
I was saddled with a hundred pounds just
act back to back

506
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,140
and the the thing be set in like in less
than a second

507
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,820
so I'm around is not always the answer

508
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,730
but it helps special tickets I for I'm

509
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,340
with you compared to cracking web

510
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,600
web is a stream cipher and I don't know
much about it

511
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,969
to be honest loss leader

512
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,830
it was our questions

513
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:32,178
that any good

514
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:37,730
okay shaken its

515
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,900
okay I'm officer the spectrum

516
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,320
is that it is a difference is that we
know happened hope summertime

517
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,918
you can use different with the you know
happens your personal time

518
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,740
other words if I just say if I change
the last bit

519
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,350
a pair but he did in

520
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,020
a star the number I feel it in a star
that same number I changed one bit

521
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,250
that did it again ASI what changes at
the end

522
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,330
arm sometimes you need that you can get
characteristics were

523
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,899
you know this this kit this differential
change will never happen

524
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,990
has your percent chance you can use that

525
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:18,290
the same way we did before you partially
eclipsed the last round

526
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,080
what guessing the subkey and if you get
that differential that supposed to

527
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,600
happen

528
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,110
this was never happen the note that he
is no good you can throw it away

529
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:33,110
you can narrow it down like that

530
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,220
yielding I I like I said difference
between houses

531
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,150
discount its kinda the building blocks
the used about other attacks

532
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,860
I'm pretty much if you read your other
stuff every other attack

533
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,530
is is written about in the context the
difference between house

534
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:04,320
I'm one of these is Conway's linear when
your tax

535
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,750
arm its it's very very similar but
instead it using

536
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,750
differentials instead of taking a pair
of numbers and

537
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,570
X on its gather and tracking how that
were sold changes we track Tom

538
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,080
bit parity so if we have a up other
characteristic

539
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,230
but like the one little means binary
here

540
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,820
what that means is that

541
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,909
if we send a plain text in and

542
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:37,250
in bits 74 and three act if they
actually gather

543
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,830
to get some somewhat one bit result it
means that the

544
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,860
output if you XO orbits 5310

545
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,889
they're going to they're going to be the
same

546
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:51,669
or they're going to be different but the
chance that happening are skewed

547
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:55,299
that supposed to happen fifty percent
the time no more

548
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,650
no less its any different than that then
you can

549
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,470
then you can do that's that prediction
you can d trip to last around what guess

550
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,290
that's up to you

551
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:09,320
and see if it matches your prediction
that are linear cryptanalysis is a

552
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,120
to foundation how it works now if you
want to learn more about the stuff

553
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,910
all the papers out there are retiring by
Matthews and understand them

554
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,529
some stigma but there's there's a couple
exceptions

555
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,650
one of them is a book called a modern
cryptanalysis does and doesn't miss a

556
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,940
Christopher Swanson

557
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,920
is the author said phenomenal book on

558
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,280
that the egos in this pain in this exact
same can stop you can read about a more

559
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,020
deliberately

560
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,060
and I and work through it I really
recommend you guys write code if you

561
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,020
want to go into the stuff

562
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,509
arm if you just try and work out on
paper in like a kid out kinda makes

563
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:46,910
sense

564
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,299
is not gonna work I to write prefer
concept owed

565
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,380
to get arm and then after you do that

566
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,930
noted test tested against brute force to
make sure you're actually being at and

567
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,020
let us work

568
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,800
um work for tips on that

569
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,210
make sure you test all the functions so

570
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,590
for instance that up that they're wise
rotation

571
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,650
she does not have on

572
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,860
a bitwise rotation operator has shipped

573
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,250
but you can't is wrote a lot she lets
users assembly

574
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,450
in line so you to write a function to
rotate bits

575
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,799
which now that sounds easy in this but
if you get it wrong

576
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,070
and then you work for another week
trying to figure out why or why you're

577
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:32,700
you can also work and it turns out that
even at on

578
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,250
when writing for functions make sure
that you check he depicted gonna make

579
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,680
sure come back at the same time

580
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,129
its

581
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,420
location on

582
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,550
up we talk about differentials light
when you take these two numbers actually

583
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,450
gather

584
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,899
and you have this this differential that
does deciphering changes

585
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,760
are another way you can modify this
issues recall truncated differentials

586
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,060
instead of looking for exact numbers

587
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,640
with the sex or value mister predicting
that no pass into numbers and actually

588
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,600
go b7

589
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,279
that I predict it's going the Chamber's
out attacks or the three

590
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,990
mister doing that you predict bits

591
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:19,080
in that differential so

592
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,049
if I send them two numbers that do not
have a difference

593
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,870
in this bit 7 bit but they do have a
difference in this bed

594
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,650
and that don't have a difference in this
bed I don't care about the rest on they

595
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,360
can be anything

596
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,940
the top and I'm able to predict the
output

597
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,470
were at least changed the SAR this but
this bit 0 ver here

598
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,359
I am these happen a lot more often
because now looking for specific

599
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,880
differences you're looking for

600
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,880
partial differences should

601
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,200
too much hard used

602
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,330
are

603
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,049
I have any questions I if not arm

604
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,680
comfort come by me and i commercial and
talk about the stuff from

605
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,730
draw diagrams in hope my ramen more
sense

606
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,820
