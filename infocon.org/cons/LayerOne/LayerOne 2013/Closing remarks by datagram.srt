62
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,739
lockpicking village is now awesome I
think I

63
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,280
as far as Congo and I got a lot to

66
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,190

of them are not very hands-on

67
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,830
you might like to learn about something
you gotta talk you learn about it

68
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,880

badge doesn't mean it's getting a sore

102
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,810

103
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,909
and 0 okay

104
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,070

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,479
sweep generator would you do with that
little

108
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,210
la transmitter and make it into a
voltage-controlled oscillator

109
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,960
which what side do makes FN's we made a
real racket on FM radio on the lab in

lap arm

124
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,750
good idea I had to switch because thats
super fucking helpful and the proximity

125
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,720
sensor

126
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,760
and then I was basically figure out the
software because I've never really are

127
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,449
programmed

128
00:08:56,449 --> 00:09:00,430
this particular AVR before and messy out

another the contest we had was a
tamper-evident contest I

247
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,690
it really takes some serious mental
strength to do this contest

248
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,430
I especially when the organizers decided
to make a time travel themed and have

249
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,330
all these weird

250
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,740
I causality loopholes that can screw you
on points

251
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,220
I think everybody like that we tried
some new things me the contest a

252
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,740
a little smaller but each things a
little bit harder wanna

253
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,270
what are the things we made was a box
that bounces laser beams around and you

254
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,150
have to navigate the laser maze to get

255
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,640
a bill curtin thumb drive I why we're
making this
