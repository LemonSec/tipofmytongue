1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,180
I for those so this year we sat down he
said i wanna talk to her wanna get the

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,289
same talks I said you know you should do

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,629
he should take apart all of your
competitors products and give a talk on

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,050
that now be awesome

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,230
so this is the fridge that talk give a
big round of applause

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:21,230
thank you very much for a

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,920
many do you know me at we were on the 23
be shop in Fullerton which by the way

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,539
our after party is going to be

9
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,309
starting out some o'clock or so %uh
popular one anchored ever in the comic

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:32,710
and

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,899
up any case at ever install waking up

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,940
our people feel this morning awesome
alright how about internships

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,660
wats up laxalt it turned up

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,559
yeah 0 type

15
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,390
I have a similar key crack I think those
are less dangerous up

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,780
alright so I'm a dive right in this
we've got a lot of stuff

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,589
I how many guys 10 days after alright

18
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,869
you that it do not use desk and pack ago

19
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,960
up or give away a story and

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,729
so there's a lot of stuff government a
diving into this but first ball home you

21
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,340
guys are taking stuff apart

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,460
we like taking some aright I may be
successfully put something back together

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:20,939
again

24
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,548
okay about half alright so well to start
rates

25
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:29,460
him you know reverse engineering is

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,809
pretty broad topic it's one these things
that's is not talked about their

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,880
I discover there are a lot of places to
learn about how to take apart and learn

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,850
from other designs

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,399
early every commercial product to get is
probably

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,840
somebody in there went to frys bought a
competitor's product into the tear down

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,700
whether the limit of so subspace
principles

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,149
so what does reverse engineering its
base in the process to figure out how

33
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:53,130
something works

34
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,360
I'm far from richard fineman the rules
of the game you know he compares

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,310
physics to like a chess game you're
observing by by watching the players

36
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,799
play

37
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,680
the key thing and I think this is lost a
lot of talks about hacking

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,690
is it if you want to modify the rules
the gamer cheaper change them

39
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,859
you really have to understand them first
in fact you have to understand them

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,599
sometimes better than the people who

41
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,119
made the game up in couple interesting
things if you looked in all their

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,400
know it he'd get ham radio or toaster
whatever it is

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,120
you know from the nineteen sixties
through the eighties chances are she

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,370
opened up there's a schematic on the
inside a television or radio whatever

45
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,400
and even came with service manuals their
operation things like that

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,019
unfortunately that's all considered I P
the most part by companies these days

47
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:42,690
and a lot of information away the really
don't want you anyone apparent a product

48
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,970
right they want to buy another one

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,780
the you know they think everything's IP
services law enforcement so

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,560
what we do well you know of we how a few
basic tools at our disposal

51
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,650
weekend first of repair stuff that's

52
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,879
designed not to be repairable you know
no user serviceable parts inside

53
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,159
learn about fly just like the cake I'll
pick a modifier stuff

54
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,409
in so we have something that was not
intended to

55
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,679
you know be expandable or to be purpose
for

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,459
no other than a dumb consumer and use
maybe we can

57
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,500
you make it is a mouse we can she please
or sparks

58
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,519
people who make consumer electronics buy
stuff in the millions in tens of

59
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:25,080
millions

60
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,390
we don't normally have access to that
they also have %ah

61
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,629
modules and things that can be you know
plucked out about device

62
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,620
and things like our suppliers or your
radio transmitter modules are ever that

63
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,840
someone spend millions of dollars making
the switch it cost three dollars we can

64
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,159
pluck it out and use it

65
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,179
kinda cool and me a big things we can
learn from

66
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,220
millions Matt are as an engineering some
input into this

67
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,120
dumb low-cost device and realize it's
actually fairly smart inside me we can

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,390
pick up a few those

69
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,250
things for self so you know how to do
this right

70
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,610
first off we economy peacock is about
safety

71
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,450
a high-voltage really our biggest danger
couple oldest

72
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,909
me a principles led by I anything 48 or
50 balls

73
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,670
somewhere around there on dry skin
anything higher not be dangerous

74
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,370
but he somehow flat broke and a
compromise can

75
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,850
far more dangerous and larval stages in
chile also it is basically you have a

76
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,340
you know on a few 100 kilograms 220
gonzo resistance on your skin

77
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,400
that basic drop still most that short of
its compromise

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,849
we have the possibility of shock even
electrocution

79
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,690
if it goes across your heart in some way
complete the circuit are

80
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,900
burns I can happen just even at low
voltage is high currents

81
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,440
our classes those problem thank you have
lined up there

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,030
about so pretty simple lot of this is
common sense

83
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,239
we look up for warning labels I'll you
know little white wires that house

84
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,759
much thicker insulation and all the
other wires I CRT televisions monitors

85
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,550
are notorious for this you'll see one
wire the house like a quarter-inch thick

86
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,080
insulation and a

87
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,330
paraffin conductor on the inside about
sin

88
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,690
you know that but two inches insulation
on the top button you know two incidents

89
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,139
later on nothing if thinking

90
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,860
avoid it right so shielding you'll see
things like a

91
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,740
laser cutter die cut plastic over power
supply bits

92
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,800
things like up and you'll see the
universal

93
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,530
I what is warning that's one left in the
one on the right issues more for

94
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,460
no power plants and junction boxes
stuffy see that too

95
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,359
ocelots advices you have have hibels is
one way or another

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,479
people on the lookout for anything the
plugs into the wall right

97
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,490
it's gonna have at least 110 it's not to
20

98
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,060
about switching power supplies can
actually boost up to 300 possible

99
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,220
before they take it on the twelfth
surprise

100
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,449
micro uplands probably 10 biggest
killers

101
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,880
about those about 1500 false somewhere
around there

102
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,909
and have enough current to kill you
instantly but it's really good source a

103
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,789
parts

104
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:07,400
you can do things like cut the but
10,000 tonnes a pair for Penn wire out a

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,830
secondary and

106
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,289
but a few routes serve in number 10
wired internet on arc welder

107
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,690
or a really good source of high voltage
parts to you be very very careful

108
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,150
my friends because they will kill you
and then CRT into devices that's like

109
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,400
neon signs

110
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,609
plasma TVs even our Calif on my category

111
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,340
us your two monitors back into
transmitter equipment my career stuff

112
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,960
stuff look out for the key things you
wanna power of stuff

113
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,830
when you a part of something can still
shock you

114
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,300
inland tell me what right that's good

115
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,430
someone gets tips

116
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,410
in up wearing reversals use this is
kinda going on

117
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,630
in order to you electrocute you it's a
it's a lot easier if

118
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,530
there's a circuit the complete across
your heart that can happen from your

119
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,710
hands which are usually the thing
getting high voltage

120
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,049
your feet or across France or in
reversal choose

121
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,110
you not being grounded is actually
really simply whether

122
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,180
and keeping one hand your pocket that's
a really old school like

123
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,030
out a navy election type thing or
whatever but his lot harder to complete

124
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,150
a circular cross your heart

125
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,859
if there is only one poll so

126
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,729
basic stuff and insulated tools I I
think

127
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:24,460
everyone whose take a lot of stuff apart
has

128
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,138
at some point to something discovery was
hot or you change a light switch in our

129
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,990
house ins covers on greater

130
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,020
of nice nothing arcsin you know pops
that

131
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,500
at least it was electrically connected
to you you might record tool

132
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,669
so scary clowns love you know me know I

133
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,960
don't really care for clouds I you might
see some these workouts lights so

134
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,400
if you see a scary clown be sure to yell

135
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,780
have a better tomorrow yeah let's get

136
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,969
alright so so much was the trade I've
actually brought my tick marks will

137
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,660
spread as I heard a minute

138
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,879
but this is simply take apart your

139
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
standard screwdrivers Phillips 103 they
get

140
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,210
you know most if your heavy lifting done
flatly it usually is for prying in a few

141
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,359
little things

142
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,539
small screwdrivers security drivers

143
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,750
are important thing to do you yeah I
have a set of these

144
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,300
security bets I have you know basic
stuff

145
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,690
I love these little tiny German
screwdrivers me by you have corporation

146
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,699
if you're in only by like a few high
dollar tools I recommend putting money

147
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,069
into small screwdrivers

148
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:33,510
the smaller their little they're
insulated and they have these really

149
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,010
nice garden tips

150
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,069
and the Middle goes like almost always
room in a break

151
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,459
wreck more stuff for Keith Wilson
anything else take apart

152
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,640
so I have lots to traverse ones on top
are the bigger security

153
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,370
torque sexes squares stuff like that of
the other ones are

154
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,200
little you know security bits Intel
security that's you know people really

155
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
don't want tix apart

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,580
other typically the same fasteners used
to you like X is an

157
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,680
and forks is but they have a post in the
middle

158
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,660
pay phones have I think it's a 5 30
seconds side

159
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,100
security hack software I am

160
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,390
I'm saying that's good sorce parts for
your project this'll screwdrivers lots a

161
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,910
different you know Friday's

162
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,600
us in the face guitar pick that's when
my favorite others are great for

163
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,410
spreading cases apart

164
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,980
a saw blade I wanna play more

165
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,220
I regular hacks is taking a at

166
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,160
wall wart that's a weird voltage
switching power supply version will

167
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,560
square bricks come with laptops & router
is everything

168
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,989
and if you saw a corner the case open
the hacksaw blade you can usually pry

169
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,920
apart the ultrasonic welts

170
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,089
and you can pop it open get that case
prep I

171
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,920
having a very sockets drivers licences
quarter-inch high-quality ratchet buckle

172
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,490
snap-on is actually replying

173
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,410
you can buy whatever dumb I bits you
want for but that is worth its weight in

174
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,810
gold oftentimes

175
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,469
and you can check it into like a
cordless screwdriver

176
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,779
when I S players tweezers I really like
a tweezers we start getting into playing

177
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:03,870
surface not parts

178
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,399
all German find tweezers only set you
back about six bucks

179
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,019
delivers that wire strippers I recommend
getting nice gauge specific wire

180
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:12,760
strippers

181
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:19,029
I have couple pairs

182
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,880
user actually sizet for and one is more
for like a

183
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,390
number ten through 16 gauge the others
deal goes down 30 gauge

184
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,890
and modifying stuff little tiny at 30
gauge Cynara tough on wire

185
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,079
is one of the best things like if you
cut a trace of an exacto knife

186
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:39,489
anyone to move somewhere else or jack in
the largely built for the programmer

187
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,560
is little tiny things are like gold for
cutting up wireless they're adding a

188
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,260
little jumpers

189
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,779
serves as a yes but my stuff the upper
right hand corner of the soldering stuff

190
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,120
that's where you have fine I have worked
very very fine and medium

191
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,810
sigh solder problem for or water clean
if you

192
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,319
do I clean it i 100 percent I so alcohol

193
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,899
you can actually buy about at electronic
store it's really good at it or move

194
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,140
stuff that

195
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,600
include residue influx that regular up

196
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,480
alcohol from you know the the drugs for
a lot do

197
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,600
magnifiers wat will get talking about as
well passed out a crisp and is good

198
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,690
sometimes

199
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,970
you need to make sure your equipment is
totally part of discharged as you are

200
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,269
creating olympians about the ground
without you gotta be careful

201
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,490
but if you're work at a high dollar
stuff especially like us instant my

202
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,560
craving equipment and things worth

203
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,489
like a really sensitive your receiver
front-end you can blow stuff up it's

204
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,860
great to have a

205
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,940
so in ok im taking tough part 1 will
look a bit about that

206
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,640
and what do we want to use for you know
how we figure out what's going on right

207
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,160
we Cassie electron so test measure
equipment

208
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,689
the most basic things a multimeter only
have a multimeter

209
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,519
rate is no excuse not to have one you
can spin for dollars on a flu

210
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,139
with everything in the thermocouple
attachment you can also buy one for five

211
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,560
bucks Harbor Freight

212
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,510
I like having a couple those around good
as disappointing sacrificing something

213
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,480
that may or may not have twelve animals
on up

214
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,600
yeah you're not alone when your neighbor
Harbor Freight rape

215
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,209
ac/dc voltage you know find out what
wire connects to what

216
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:22,138
continuity you try to track down where
traces a circuit board go

217
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,240
I resistance you know really good thing
to have

218
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,360
up is all the special diesel yes our
meter if you fix stuff

219
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,920
up you never heard a capacitor play

220
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,459
so there are a lot of bad pastors mean
Asia

221
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,949
that have infested lacrosse equipment
made from like the early nineties for

222
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,790
president

223
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,839
and you also just fine undersize
underrated caps

224
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,040
other use for filtering power and you
know power supply components typically

225
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,529
well that's like the number one source
for failure their big they have

226
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:57,670
John is who's inside them so not only
salt state and oftentimes good ones are

227
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,550
expensive so the undersized them

228
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,870
like to put a 24 volts of power supply I
filter

229
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,380
capital be 25 watt rating one tiny SAR
are surging goes good night

230
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,589
well there's a nice leader starts about
50 boxing by Others on call the blue sea

231
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:12,730
I think from house on

232
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,240
its you let you test as captain circuit

233
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,980
you can sometimes find them you know
then we'll we'll talk about identify

234
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,820
that stuff

235
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,209
but this is a really cool to leave your
into fixing stuff if all you're doing is

236
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:26,170
just you know cutting stuff oddly
purpose in it you don't need it

237
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,000
but that is worth its weight in gold we
probably 65 televisions outweigh

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,980
so a multimeter action a you see that
said the number on there

239
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,209
it says 4.99 and what do you suppose
that signal as on their

240
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,170
right that's false so that's a5 a
logical I'm in this case that was the

241
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,229
turn on line for a plasma television I
want to find out the logic board was

242
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,070
actually doing what a source close to
you when you push the button

243
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,149
sell for you know what from 0 to you
know

244
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,010
five-plus Nov 25 als for me to say that
outlines probably

245
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,610
active I you know worth it for measuring
so many different things

246
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,320
some other things logic analyzer this is
also a specialty tool and

247
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,519
and takes in training our practice but a
really cool thing

248
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,829
it does not show you anything about
waveforms or

249
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:18,199
what the actual signal looks like out
what it does let you do though

250
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,459
is that lets you see you zeros and ones
in

251
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:25,689
it lets you capture them at a very high
re and then play them back later

252
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,740
a lot of them have tools for doing
things like telling you

253
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,740
what actual English ASCII message was
sent to a serial for

254
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,100
or what characters what's this chip and
a nice pretty message to control

255
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,199
so if you can capture those for them
write them down

256
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,060
in Fairless going on you can crafter on
messaging hooked up you can figure out

257
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,859
how to

258
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,699
Jack charge me know when they're in
replay that same message to make the

259
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,529
thing turn on whatever is what you

260
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:55,579
invaluable the can go for ten thousand
dollars or more for a very fancy

261
00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:00,189
you many channel high-speed versions up
no space labs has a recent phone call

262
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,420
the analogical I think it's like 50
bucks

263
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,420
there's one called sealy that's good
I'll still be suitable for a wide range

264
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,110
of stuff you'll encounter

265
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,300
microcontrollers in everything from
blender is to televisions to

266
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,819
you know small consumer electronics
musical instruments this is kinda like

267
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,269
the

268
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:20,329
yep it looks like this is a
software-based one picked up the USB

269
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,339
port

270
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,899
and in this case I hooked up I it's
called Rs 45 its industrial

271
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:30,009
2-wire serial protocol from an alarm
system

272
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:34,660
and light type numbers mixed pad us try
to figure out what kind of preamble and

273
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,769
message in

274
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:40,190
arm and disarm signal was sending well
you can see this is actually join me

275
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,790
what happened on both those lines no one
goes high and the other on

276
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,540
automatically goes lower exactly the
same a sequence

277
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,219
and when I put through a filter on
showing the characters like a

278
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,230
so I can see what saying I think that's
the alarm or something

279
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,290
so gives you some cool stuff

280
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,959
office let's go this is something for
measuring fast changes

281
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,130
the EC characteristics and stuff you're
all very focused on software and logic

282
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,300
programming

283
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,680
but you realize that digital signals are
just analog signals during the

284
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,258
maturation

285
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:17,300
that's pretty awesome on your everything
that happens is julie housen analog

286
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,149
component

287
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,779
you know when you run swing through wire
your change its properties are out

288
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,529
inductance of or so

289
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,920
is can do lots of cool stuff any call
season to see what's happening with

290
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,660
things like

291
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,000
transmitters in clocks in and so forth
up

292
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,079
this is we have in all Tektronix I would
recommend

293
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,229
final beat-up Tektronix cope an analog
one this was actually just although it

294
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,660
looks alt one-on-one

295
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,189
and you can see things like sign away in
square waves in reining in

296
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,040
you can find out sometimes lets us
misbehaving and this will measure

297
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,149
faults in owns and things like that
independent how you hook it up

298
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:54,329
you can measure like the peak to peak
voltage like I can see that

299
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,989
this is set to one ball per division
that's a square and so the saying is

300
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,269
doing plus runs to halt so that's
basically

301
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:07,269
the no formal potential cross that a
logical stuff I can do a fat

302
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,309
yeah awesome

303
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,099
k soldering iron assume lots of people
here are from where soldering

304
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:19,789
up most the stuff we buy is put together
with solder rights low temperature alloy

305
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,349
that sticks are

306
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,980
you know copper and steel on lead in 10
stuff together

307
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,760
if you're going to modify stuff you're
basically in the romanov

308
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,770
rework so you're sorry has to be very
good especially if it's something that

309
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,629
was put together in a factory under
control conditions with

310
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,590
a automated equipment and school
operators so I really recommend getting

311
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,379
a good temperature controlled soldering
iron you don't have to spend a thousand

312
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,559
dollars

313
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,928
50 bucks will get you let go entry-level
Hakko or

314
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:53,130
the AU why there's on this on Amazon for
like 20 different names that's not bad

315
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,730
a couple hundred bucks will get you on
that Cal which is really nice used

316
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,309
the other five or six airbags new bed
that's our index all other southerners

317
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:02,950
look like robert Bentley gets like two
thousand dollar range

318
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,750
super awesome I want to be able to bury
the temperatures the key

319
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,600
and you really want something with a
good amount of heat if your tryin to

320
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,719
on solder unseat a component that saw
torch lighter brown playing like a big

321
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,640
want a copper

322
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,559
heatsink also I guess right lead free
solder

323
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,789
your sin that you never try to solder

324
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,379
sucks a it doesn't let and it takes
really high temperature

325
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,510
says something you can jack the
temperature upper for a high temperature

326
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,400
tip on the life rather stuff

327
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,570
really useful the house another trick
you can

328
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,299
I'm not some leaded solder in there back
using more surface area for an outsider

329
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,860
in our interconnected n

330
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,449
and alloys with about stuff and it makes
it not a lot lower and lets you get rid

331
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,460
of it

332
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,059
a hot air station also really good for
taking some small parts of

333
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,299
is the problem is you cannot one lead
but you've got 10 lead on that thing

334
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,490
had to get off well hot air is a good
way to do that right you see people

335
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,559
thing up and plug of a tweezers

336
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,710
so this is my setup a simple Potter
station

337
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,640
I think I was like 60 bucks on Amazon or
Ebay and then I smack al that some X 500

338
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,440
a any of them are are awesome

339
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,980
a device programmers how many have you
ever program that shit for all anything

340
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,750
can be done that so in the olden days

341
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,080
a things like burglar alarms in cars and
stuff

342
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,379
had a big socket and ship and you could
pull it off and maybe could read the

343
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,160
contents

344
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,299
sludge stuff is still there acceptance
be soldered down

345
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,780
on nowadays we have a lot of stuff that
has a microcontroller

346
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,850
so little Gator 16 or 32 bit computer

347
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,030
oftentimes houses program stored on that
ship and flash from

348
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,260
oftentimes house other stuff up well

349
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,789
depending on what we have there are

350
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,360
you only a few major families these
ships a microchip corporation

351
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,678
Atmel the AVR serious the pics the
microchip

352
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,820
and then various the deep that G tag a

353
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,149
enables chips with the Armik or
something like that on them

354
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:08,590
they can be readily manipulated with
inexpensive tools that the manufacturer

355
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,449
but the software the drivers the cable
the doctors everything in a package is

356
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,490
all that you for

357
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,730
35 boxer 100 bucks very nice to have a
selection of these

358
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,280
anything that you're going to be hacking
modifying cetera

359
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,030
a you're somebody has walk out before
and oftentimes that designer

360
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,299
picked out because the manufacture me
the tools simple and easy to get

361
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,460
and if you can get access that same tool
chain you save:

362
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,860
days if not months labor trying to
reverse engineer something

363
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,610
so this is really simple devices as
usual circuit board an enclosure

364
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,620
and USB cable an instance of free
downloader comes on a CD

365
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,559
there are also commercial packages I
like I A R that combine a bunch these

366
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,760
tools in one place me what to charge you
hundreds or thousands dollars

367
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,158
something's up student versions which
will work on a smaller chips or

368
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,990
free versions to the one you have dinner
chip other diseases like

369
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,730
the the the Atmel AVR products
everything

370
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,169
even forty plus plus and a similar for
their

371
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:11,650
32-bit ships those are included one big
free download

372
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,020
I and is awesome open source stuff so
really awesome

373
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,370
can't say enough good things about
owning a few these in playing with them

374
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,750
and you in a few simple projects

375
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,799
so inspection magnification a all
jeweler's loupe

376
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,908
is really nice to have you're looking
over some a magnifier like this year to

377
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:33,200
beauticians office a stereomicroscope
electrical Saturday's last that's really

378
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,940
nice to have

379
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,059
and actually started Charlie 100 boxes
that we're paying for those

380
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,889
yeah I'm Scott those are awesome there
bc it for a long throw something here

381
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,820
hands under

382
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,250
to use for like inspection or die
dissection

383
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,760
history of taking apart stuff and

384
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,580
you see what some have lied on top of it
ivory abilities online I really like

385
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,520
I wouldn't buy the thousand-dollar wing
like this offer I just make something

386
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,139
and you can get up close and personal
things like this right got small sums

387
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,970
not ships

388
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,059
you can use you're out your tweezers
right up under their make sure your

389
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,460
plucking the right part

390
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,539
you can find about solder joint you can
spec stuff that you

391
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:17,700
worked on and you can get down to some
very very tiny parts I think that's a no

392
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,380
603 and

393
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,299
I thought just south of 23 it's another
the 510 package

394
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:28,059
I am stop out for something but you can
really get in there easily and plug

395
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,139
stuff out it's it's like you're working
with

396
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,000
big Lego blocks instead of tiny tiny
suffering a price parts

397
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,830
surprise it out once if also if you want
to get pictures are one

398
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,129
you ever taking tragic pictures results
go for a microscope

399
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,789
they make no fancy adapter rings and
stuff will do a great job

400
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:48,840
if you set a point and shoot camera
remained on camera phone

401
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,209
on infinity and stick it right up in
there you can usually get a good picture

402
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,309
and you can send that to somebody and
share whatever you do

403
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:02,879
I use that to twists and the arm
offender gets a defective parts replaced

404
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,539
okay so I would take subpar at Powergen
are gonna go about this

405
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,900
so first thing seems obvious we want to
power

406
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,030
we got fasteners generally stops
altogether you know not just by

407
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,668
and we don't have the week atomic force
or other sites for every six up together

408
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,169
so we gotta put stuff in there I got
screws

409
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:26,470
oftentimes treasure hidden like under do
not remove warranty penalty of death

410
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,700
you know so you for singers and without

411
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,210
I understood Kors the rubber feet are
notorious for writings

412
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,549
spatters glue a 10 things I despise what
Apple products they love glue everything

413
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:39,559
together

414
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,700
fortunately he gone from Home Depot or
even a hair dryer sometimes

415
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,960
all you need is of not blue their of
mica tape stripper sucked like that

416
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,570
and then you can use the in protect our
pic trip like we discussed their key

417
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,740
spreader cats

418
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,880
other also these little pots papers that
you use for cleaning cast iron in

419
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,230
non-stick pans as a great tough one like
played

420
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,289
squeegee about plastic tabs

421
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:07,200
this is the bane anybody's ever take
apart a laptop you break capital stupid

422
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,429
tabs and then

423
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:11,919
you never you know it's kinda wonky in
there or try to get in

424
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,650
if you're careful when you can find them
tear down got a really good for that

425
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,200
looking those up upright a selection of
high-quality screwdrivers have different

426
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,490
you know

427
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,500
late lets you can get in there others
long flat plastic things are good for

428
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,240
putting

429
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,360
pressure over a wide area and not
breaking one of and if you break one

430
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,689
you know super glue that's what that's
for our TV is good to you

431
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,130
John to take apart again so and do in
stock I went around

432
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,460
our shop and that you know what do we
have has a wide variety of power and

433
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,340
signal on

434
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,020
junking it and I think it occurred to me
there's boat anchor a 50-inch television

435
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,370
in the corner

436
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,270
so I thought I'd tear that down.
something ever encino probably simply

437
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,100
that TV is your life

438
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,370
so I sort of like lets you turn out so

439
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,229
you know guitar screwdrivers out that
was pretty straight for the actual

440
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,909
arrows marking rosters are

441
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,000
preggers pleasantries break all the time

442
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,559
I'll so my favorite trips you can get a
i magnetic

443
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,110
parts bin you can just drop stuff on
there if you don't care I can magnetized

444
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,330
it's not a fine instrument or something

445
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,720
egg cartons are really good I strip of
tape

446
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,370
reading to staple little baby stuff on
there like tiny tiny screws

447
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,809
Summers is there late magnetism from
your screwdrivers will pick those up

448
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,070
are some things are so small get static
will take about

449
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:32,658
so teachers without a big fat taking
photos online to see can find out where

450
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:34,260
the long and short skirt where

451
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,220
and you can share it later perhaps so
this is a single that the government

452
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,640
and we can see we've got too much stuff
going on we've got a lot of hair

453
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,630
which is good like if we were to try and
add something to it later we have a lot

454
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,770
of space

455
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,700
up BC we have a lot to be heatsinks
you've got like 12

456
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,710
34 early six boards in there

457
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,429
and you're gonna wanna figure out those
are before you do anything

458
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:01,809
so after it's a case of very common

459
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,080
we need to take connectors of another
thing is just connected by a bunch of

460
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,549
wires that are barely short up to regen

461
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:11,480
and you'll see this all the time and
stuff

462
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,159
those things especially ones in laptops
cameras small mechanical items

463
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,590
they can have is very very fragile
razor-thin connectors you might wanna

464
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,889
spend 10 minutes looking dapper gently
prying urgently nudging

465
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,179
have to figure out where u to push the
lock down deep what up

466
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:29,659
because usually I get one try with us or
a bust of knots about

467
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:33,520
AC here we've got a couple different
cities like point one hundred pitch

468
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,779
connectors is a free search for the one
left it has a lock UBS after private

469
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,350
popular players should ever

470
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,360
on the right to sport straight-out I you
can put a screw driver Adam

471
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,590
and just nudge the law class extra
bottle if you want the probably pull up

472
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,399
without much

473
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,460
much trauma in so

474
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,350
this thing anything that you are ever
gonna get

475
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,529
if you want start discipline figure out
how it works

476
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:02,120
it's going to help our spy right you
gotta have electrons moving from high to

477
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,928
low potential somehow for some

478
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,350
to do anything that parts like to be a
battery but there's also a some kind of

479
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,870
power conditioning

480
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,529
you know play that's where all starts
for the power cord comes in

481
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:18,120
I you're gonna see power stuff big wires
affect racism circuit board

482
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,279
you know I a trace the carries multiple
amps is gonna be

483
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,799
you like five long years why it is not
going to be a

484
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,129
reserve fanned seven all trace for
signal it would just be a prize if they

485
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,880
try to put that much right through it

486
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,179
in but want these things to do also for
troubleshooting

487
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:38,799
start where the battery or the mains
connection comes and start racing that

488
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,750
you're gonna see no circuit breaker
switch fuse you can test that stuff

489
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,130
you're trying to figure out why the
things that I you can also

490
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,029
start looking at what goes in and what
comes out the other boards may be on to

491
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:51,559
use that power supply

492
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,620
for some up power supplies are also your
most common source of dead

493
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,299
equipment you're gonna see stuff because
this thing is handling

494
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:04,049
he you know it's going to speak he in
this process is doing its job love

495
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:08,240
governing voltage other voltages are
ever its handling lot of power

496
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,090
it's got a lot of high current going on
off very quickly

497
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,709
very high I instantaneous changes so
that's a start on stuff he

498
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,059
and changing high currents are gonna

499
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:24,428
you know beat someone comes up things
like a passer as usual the first to fail

500
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:29,630
sometimes also I solder joints crap
loose I conductors as the 60 Hertz in

501
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,710
whole thing and so forth in mechanically
you know

502
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,299
destabilize stuff so this is a good
place look for stuff

503
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,429
so alright thus the parcel out at all
then so

504
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:43,240
and you notice something big is big for
Glee fans were thus

505
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,419
right was your caps and that would be
when you're first things look for

506
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:47,460
fussing was dat

507
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,600
abuse your balls in the top that's also

508
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,500
danger a those things it combine is
probably have enough energy to restart

509
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,580
your heart

510
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,750
and that's exactly what's inside that he
deals on the wall the hotel probably

511
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,270
about

512
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,620
doesn't he's I also see some
transformers

513
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,580
as many things now those if you're not
going to use that power supply

514
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,139
you pull those out and measure in the

515
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,480
the primary and secondary me you know
maybe step aboard the chopper down to

516
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:14,929
make

517
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:18,399
a power supply for Geiger counter you do
simple things

518
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,229
this chokes is to be useful others blue
object those are relays

519
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,230
and those are great well that was the
top onus the bottom ones might be

520
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,409
something else

521
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:31,580
I those are great for doing things like
I L controlling big loads those ur

522
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,600
dumb and simple and easy to repurpose a
bunch these other

523
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,750
I season here might be house marked it
might not be something you get really

524
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,710
reviews

525
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,899
but you know you've got a lot of stuff
to work with now turns out

526
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:48,178
any LCD TV you have 24 volt 12:05 all
trails

527
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,820
South you can pretty readily repurpose
other TVs have a buncha

528
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,860
60 in 204 trails outta

529
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,199
out about you that's not so useful
mister trying to do something

530
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,220
after you try to trip but or something

531
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,309
but the thing is also kind of bad for
troubleshooting because you have lots of

532
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,970
high-voltage high-current stuff
everywhere

533
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,870
who

534
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,239
good here

535
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,289
have you tried turning off and on again
up

536
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:27,350
fun dead battery yeah baby

537
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,730
as that day ahead

538
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:37,399
30 I and I tried turning off and on
again

539
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:40,739
so anyway AC comes the bottom lots of
different DC

540
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,970
power comes out these things I'll watch
sports right

541
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,100
know that nothing will see YouTube we
see models loads it ships with lotsa

542
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,709
wires

543
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,260
and traces sea views of now some kinda
clock source

544
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,649
you know whole solar cams logic so
you'll see dumb

545
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:59,510
seven sorry small logic chips that
there's a line that's must be lower be

546
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,149
on in

547
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,399
the other ship expected to be high they
have logic chips to change that stuff

548
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,299
around

549
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:09,010
but this is pretty typical this is a
that I think this is a BG a chip on the

550
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,419
right

551
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:13,870
you know really ugly nasty to rework
chip others are probably de RAM

552
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,340
chips on the left and then there's
another flash Rumson logic and passes

553
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,100
around there

554
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,590
this is a good clear this is definitely
logic board and yes a small those wires

555
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,279
going in

556
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,630
are on the top those are like 22 gauge
those are gonna be signals

557
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:31,029
even power on the right is not very
beefy sale

558
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:34,700
what you know what connects to afford I
i think is a slaughter clues about

559
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,380
what's doing

560
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,110
servicing have been teleport serial or
USB

561
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,629
yet to conclude what I might be doing
but we have been kinda markings

562
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,860
this is what I favorites self
documentation others done Chinese power

563
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,709
supply board center and every

564
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,169
LCD TV probably usually have all the
input output in

565
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:57,720
expected voltages on all those
connectors clearly labeled

566
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,559
makes it really nice troubleshoot if you
look at this one they have %uh some test

567
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,360
points that were

568
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,019
left there by the factory and this one
it says something like data and clock

569
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:11,049
date out all we could use the see if we
knew a bit more about how

570
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:14,960
about plasma driver works to see is it
doesn't have a spotlight for

571
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,539
a scope on it or frequency counter maybe
I A Bear

572
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,908
dive into and I find out that and
they're supposed to be an enable signal

573
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,970
that comes out on day two and then gets

574
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,279
daisy chain outdate out like an maybe
measure both nurse

575
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,580
I michael take this into some also that
these things are like gold

576
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,019
and the %uh they save a lot of time also
knows that has

577
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:39,200
its function says why driver bottom
thats really nice to have also the part

578
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,399
number

579
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,299
another really good one anything that
makes a radio signal is going to have an

580
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:45,360
FCC ID

581
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,240
you can look those up our car learn
peepers you want to find

582
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,740
the right transmitter for something look
up its FCC ID

583
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,500
do a Google search do any research
you'll find out by the SEC I D even

584
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,779
though I might be in a different

585
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:02,029
color case for the different logo on it
any kinda stuff house

586
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:05,710
you know documentation is gone SEC
number really good

587
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,049
certain products love you guys so
identified in work a month before

588
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:13,539
so large components passes you know

589
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:17,110
we're talking about cap speakers sisters
usually through hole

590
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,219
stuff that's really high power often is
in stores now so what does that mean K

591
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,640
power right its handling to spin a lot
of power

592
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,809
I doctors same things usually associate
with high power circuits

593
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:33,490
little passes I you're talking tangle
service not resistors in caps

594
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,720
usually CRN signals diodes

595
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,220
you know wasn't easy stuff this
courthouse kinda be a selection about

596
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,750
that swallows driver boards

597
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,760
it's got some big high current I
capacitors in

598
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,190
those are other filter class right
behind it I think and yes it's also got

599
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,019
some little tiny signal

600
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,940
logic so it's got little what is driving
people to just that's kinda theme

601
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,690
we have microcontrollers we have digital
stuff that just

602
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,559
what's that song of and then those are
driving things they can turn those into

603
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,320
analog signals are

604
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,379
up with specialty things like video or
audio up

605
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:13,799
and then we have power you know
high-power circuitry going on offer

606
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,190
supplying that stuff

607
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,210
you can see a couple other things others
are big through war resisters in lower

608
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,320
right

609
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,139
and you've got also little tiny a your
chip resistors in caps in the middle

610
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,820
so you'll see a little everything

611
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,139
in anything are Affleck television to
nurse radio transmitters

612
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,310
count on my favorites I you'll see a
metal shielding around it

613
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:43,290
not the same as the little metal rockin
around your SD card holder

614
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,329
iris the other things like relays as
blue boxes

615
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:50,050
you can see that's going to turn in the
whole thing off if you're

616
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,089
fuel injection or cars dead you might
want to see if the relay this first

617
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:54,469
chart on the fuel pump

618
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,750
is working are surge protection

619
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,210
fuses things like that you'll see that
on the input usually coming in

620
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,240
no wires coming from outside power in
but protection circuits

621
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,930
digital circuits are very fragile and
their of going to have a big power

622
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,140
rated components they can do things like
handle power surges in your car starts

623
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,950
up or

624
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,790
I you know surges from power lines

625
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,690
then finally to have another house I'll
talk in Tisch industry standard labels

626
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,740
often see r1 r2 stuff I got a resistor
issue for caps

627
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,479
argue for ICE's and you might be able to
Google

628
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,349
some others you might you know you 1
problem with

629
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:38,670
me a panasonic tv your whatever it will
give you a clue about working

630
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,750
and sometimes a test points leaving say
up

631
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,750
you know five all set you one clock
signal at you to pin 3

632
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,430
stuff like that gives you some idea
what's going on

633
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,759
one my absolute favorite ways to find
out what's going on with with the

634
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,430
circuit I wanna hack you know let's
identify Covenant House by its number

635
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:01,990
I'll all data sheet digikey Mauser
distributors like that you work

636
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,078
they have millions and millions a parts
and they have data sheets online going

637
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,099
back to like literally the early
seventies

638
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,690
there are parts or use the Apollo
program and larger one you can still buy

639
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,220
and if you can't chess are the issues
are still there

640
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,828
a lot times japanese companies are kinda
weird about this the liker

641
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:22,130
shame that there all component is as
good as the new one and they had a

642
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:22,980
little bit

643
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,390
but chances are someone is candid about
a book in stock online

644
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,879
in me they might make you watch out or
something but you'll get and they give

645
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,230
you lots of cool stuff

646
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,589
so these are like gold these your go to
source when you wanna hack stuff

647
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:40,630
now so what can you do with that right
here's a typical one this is a an MC

648
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,320
3406 three

649
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,680
it's a really common Australia later
every dumb

650
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,848
three-dollar I iPhone charger review by

651
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:52,450
at the 7-Eleven is gonna have on these
and lots lots of expensive parts having

652
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,770
sells for about fifteen cents a quantity

653
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,960
it's a switching power supply regulator
so the slacker I'm out a datasheet

654
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,190
it'll do it every Penn does that's
pretty handy

655
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,829
and it's got some other cool stuff
reference designs you look for those

656
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,490
designers are pretty lazy

657
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,750
and they like to reuse something that
somebody else already had a team and

658
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,970
engineers spend thousands dollars
developing for them

659
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,020
so you'll find some like this and if I
know that chip design

660
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,020
is something looks like that and Igor my
circuit board all that i'm gonna find

661
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,220
all those parts

662
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,549
in fact I'm often to find the exact
model partner was using that references

663
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,099
I'm

664
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:34,270
because somebody didn't lost an extra
day finding a cheaper better substitute

665
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,650
and it's also got so me where I might be
able to change stuff

666
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,400
in this case the a.m. before resistors
on that I think specifically are one or

667
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,700
two in the bottom

668
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,169
set the voltage that's going to come out
a thing so if I wanna turn 11 .1 volt

669
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,960
power supply for Belkin

670
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,030
1995 USB hub into

671
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:58,460
1324 ham radio charger I know where to
start looking

672
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,450
and you're gonna see the same Kansas
circuits over and over especially from

673
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,770
the same manufacture

674
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,130
or different manufacturers making the
same product is a steal from each other

675
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,650
all the time

676
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:12,119
at on our at every think bob weaver how
does intellectual property this forever

677
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,320
you know safeguard what's not event
stills from everybody

678
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,520
these are basic principles things like
inputs

679
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,509
up power supply circuits they're gonna
keep reusing stuff over and over I came

680
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,230
from the manufacturer's recommendation
their own experience the competitors

681
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,440
others are using things like interviews
of an ounce they're gonna use

682
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,960
that protection diodes and you'll see
these all circuits over and over

683
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,430
and you'll get a clue as to what's
happening going into router

684
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,720
what's going so what kind of all stuff
Rep

685
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,399
I you know what you trying to do you
want to fix it

686
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,920
joint out a future that's out there like
go you know but into a hard turn off by

687
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,329
television not have dropped 10 wats for

688
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:56,320
easy start-up to one account was it for
parts don't take that big

689
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,890
power supply outta there or that Lara
clicker module and use it for my

690
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:04,640
robot project

691
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,190
of or shrimp chips

692
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,650
up

693
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,810
not I've something heavy damage a we'll
get to that

694
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,880
okay so what's crackin strategy so first
ball

695
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,050
you in this thing do the parts come up
when i do research

696
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,170
if everything in there yet it's really
disappointing to take are some things

697
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,609
like a DVD player

698
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,630
is mostly air in like three

699
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:39,200
giant specialty made ships that say
Panasonic 6551

700
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,299
but you're never gonna find anywhere
another specialty part was made

701
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,710
keep that was made for that manufacturer
and you're not going to find a date

702
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,339
issued a height that literally

703
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:51,990
to make it more difficult to reverse
engineer also that part was that all

704
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,290
custom for one customer they don't want
shared

705
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,900
you note other customers they might have
can mine functions from a dozen ships

706
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,420
you normally see

707
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,980
and the others are not can be such a
good candidate for hacking

708
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:09,810
out one-time programmable devices you
never gotten a I'm useful Christmas card

709
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,720
your take up our what you find inside it

710
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,549
right world of boxing so you know what's
under that of a boxy

711
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,569
it's gonna be a microcontroller from a
diff from a company called a halt actor

712
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:25,380
what are the other three or four
companies have never heard a

713
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,920
make ultra low-cost devices based if
you're manufacture

714
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,960
you submit your program they put it on

715
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,250
the diet they actually burn that into
you

716
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,560
the glass masters made used to make the
chips it's called mass from program

717
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,930
and they give you a trail like two
thousand those chips

718
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,180
and there may be nikal ke sandifer and
wrong just throw the whole train another

719
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,129
on

720
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,290
they are basically Rob Harris look on

721
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,910
that step down soldered to the board and
then a global hotspot

722
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:59,069
not so shocking potential right I even
parts that have their own cases might

723
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:02,099
be made to be program once the program's
burned into a once

724
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,349
fuses are blown it can never be your
program those are things we're gonna

725
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:07,760
have to just a strategy if you wanna do
anything with it

726
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,000
you might have to just cut the trace
about and solder on

727
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,880
an apple or pick microcontroller you do
have people your program

728
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,130
I high-speed devices so I don't mean to
you

729
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,390
are from RS I got a bunny Wang he did
the

730
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:26,450
original x-box hack use it I am a PhD
student in mighty

731
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,140
yet using FPGA and build his own

732
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,160
two hundred megahertz like a DVR

733
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,450
bus never okay that's prime gonna happen
for most straight

734
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,390
anything that's high speed you know that
thing is producing gigabytes of data per

735
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,319
second

736
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:46,020
I in you access to use a overclock the
FPGA and

737
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,329
right special filter algorithms to just
are full but the traffic you do need

738
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:54,190
a you know higher speed it is the
signals degrade quickly to the active

739
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:57,260
probing it makes thing malfunctioned and
you'd have a hard time you might be

740
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,170
better off

741
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,520
think about something else anything with
difficult access

742
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,770
that little chip said Janice is on
that's a BJ number pens are accessible

743
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,440
or you can solder them a problem

744
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,980
if you take it off he can't use it and
almost certainly all those traces that

745
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,589
carry signals are buried

746
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:17,119
two three or five layers deep enough for
you know you're gonna have to look for

747
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,369
test points replaces the breakout or

748
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:23,079
make a guess when i text another chip if
you actually get access to it

749
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,390
so you know what are some things you
could do and even with those limitations

750
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,140
well if this thing has a wrong and by
looking at those part numbers can find

751
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,279
out that house in kind of program will
memory that stores a

752
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,290
a program or a very dumb for him it's
also looking hard drive for the real

753
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,240
program

754
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,618
maybe I can pull it off or captain

755
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:46,310
and maybe I can dump those contents and
change a little this is pretty classic

756
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,599
way to change

757
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,089
car performance like obd1 car computers

758
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:54,859
about the mod chips you more power and
mileage can mutually exclusive but

759
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:55,900
whatever

760
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,030
those are typically dumping are on the
doesn't necessarily have program it may

761
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,690
just have some value stored

762
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,650
you can change is magic numbers and
serve the card is something else

763
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,690
I doctor on change it you can you're
gonna have to look at it

764
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,790
you're gonna have to find a device can
program it and find a way to Tasha

765
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,930
and you're smarter devices often have
security issues is so the

766
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,770
microcontroller ROM

767
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:22,460
you might be able to write a program to
it but def whoever

768
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,420
put on there had any sense that probably
made it difficult to extract it

769
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,060
and you're gonna have to know simply
language in before if debug tools

770
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,960
fairly extensively in order to attack
secure what's doing so you can change it

771
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,680
however you're not that's more like I am
you might be able to just write new

772
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,410
program and upload it

773
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,629
but you can get if it's a well-known
tool chain like its navy are a pic

774
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:50,050
or you a few the like the STM from asia
St microcontrollers

775
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:55,140
they have lotsa easy to get out tools
and you can't get the dolphin word or

776
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,779
you can work on your project

777
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,990
and actually you know get the thing the
blinking LED and the power light and

778
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,549
then

779
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,990
or giraffe from there this is a

780
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,689
typically a good strategy for trying to
hack something really simple like coffee

781
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,940
maker

782
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:14,160
or a dumb you know turns on terms of
device for a more sophisticated by S

783
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,520
another thing to do you know what we
build out on module can we build a

784
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,740
daughter for that

785
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,290
we just knew we had this call link he
LED thing

786
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:26,290
but we don't like fooled embedded a
posse DAW maybe we can just take our

787
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,390
love

788
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,430
many art we know our you know I eighty
tiny chip for everyone

789
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,740
and soldered on top of it or make a lil
bored that we just

790
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:40,328
hotly when they ran runs more 38 wires
and connect all of the same stuff

791
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:44,010
but maybe I'll do things like have a
white Kia we for the pup

792
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,810
will turn on immediately turned off
because at some security feature that

793
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,970
we don't want that is preventing us from
enjoying our device we can lot stuff

794
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,660
there

795
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,670
tons and tons of wheat newsletter
drawers logic that we out ourselves
