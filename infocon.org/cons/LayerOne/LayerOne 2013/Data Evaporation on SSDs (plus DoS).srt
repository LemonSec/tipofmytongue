comparatively primitive device using a
magnetic card

34
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,890
I

35
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,179
in

36
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,590
theoretically

37
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,540
people video soon as I figure out which
way they can to go

38
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,660
which at work felt good

39
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,760
achieve actually mentioning late appear
whatever you like

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,019
which right which

41
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,750
function the

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,510
p

43
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,010
ha duplicates recall

44
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,660
haha me happy child are good okay this
is a glorious Windows 8 device which I

45
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,049
was completely unable to operate

46
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,870
a joint got the free button to push the
start button back oh my god

47
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,390
it's like getting thumbs up thumbs been
cut off anyway so on

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,450
or so when I got here is i picking the

49
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,589
PC with Windows 8 on edge and I

50
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,610
an SSD but we're not going to use it
right now we're going to use the hard

51
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,610
drive for starters

52
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,700
showed me a little tiny partition on the
hard drive just two hundred Magnus

53
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,329
just so everything will be kinda dashed
and I made a file

54
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,530
called spam little this file contains
spam spam spam spam

55
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,650
not very much a bit you have to give
about a kilobyte

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,420
spam or put in an unusual place on the
hard drive which messes up the demo

57
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,530
anywhere to put their on there something
I can figure out how to operate this

58
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,110
machine

59
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,300
there we are much better March should I
have put spam on my hard drive

60
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,629
and you can view it with just a plain
Heckscher

61
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:11,429
so here's a glorious free hex editor
Khaleej xD which I use all the time

62
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,830
and you go to the desk and look at the
just draw all the way we used to with

63
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,659
Norton

64
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:20,798
just editor church okay show there's the
master file

65
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,739
are mean a master record in such and
then we can go find the span

66
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,000
and narrative /span /span /span span

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,470
okay shoeless just is currently for spam
show

68
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,979
watched rushed up on I go ratio pier i
delete that file

69
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:40,710
right click deal each okay

70
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,190
is expanding gone know people say no

71
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,060
large let's try refreshing the view and
you're right

72
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,789
that's pam is still there all I did
there was altered content in the index

73
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:53,370
file

74
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,389
anonymity in the of allocation table or
in this one master file table

75
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,060
orch let's try going to the hard drive
right click

76
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,419
property age: and go over to for Maj

77
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:11,479
mom to launch alright what can I format
this drive is a killer right click

78
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,840
Format dollars in there

79
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,940
Irish right click

80
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,270
former 30 ish okay

81
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,580
chimed in a format that drive

82
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,120
now this park told me for Mattingly
racial all data on this dish

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,460
Trisha okay I don't care just do it on
grape

84
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,948
okay is that you to go the nose I hear
those nose again art list right now

85
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:37,720
shush

86
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,889
I love you refresh and

87
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,500
yeah I tried to drive has lost its
connection to the device koresh

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,180
because i format it but I can open it
again

89
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,220
and I can search for spam again

90
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,750
and

91
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,850
it's gone no I don't the last time we
did a quick format he didn't know it was

92
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,880
only a slow format to me to go away

93
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,250
but anyway sport is there to get over it
not in pain of attention my demo their

94
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,960
I thought I did a quick format which
should not arranged but it was pretty

95
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,830
reduces the old fashion world all on

96
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,590
hard drugs now let me just well got this
thing go on

97
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,258
let me just demonstrate what happened to
you do this on SSD

98
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,330
now you have to get the right as st. in
the conditions just right is the core

99
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,449
share SSD

100
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:35,060
the dead in here by removing the hard
drive and put million

101
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,330
that was a quick format from march onto
our control that permitted on commission

102
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,710
measures every time I do it

103
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,508
however chief get how this fun stuff
happen with an ash st

104
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,590
you have to have a fairly large amount
of data like a gigabyte

105
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,049
show I mean SST partition the two
gigabytes

106
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,850
and I formatted in NTFS and I made a
folder for spam it's all good bye to

107
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,860
spare

108
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,229
and I put that on there in this is a
course why you get SSD is because their

109
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,008
nation faster this is gonna copy

110
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:11,580
in just a few seconds which is very much
nicer than hard

111
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,469
and while it's happening let me go to
each XD

112
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,630
and mount that dish

113
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,280
in at just called Isis dnt fashion I
guess there's no reason I came out it

114
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,270
was writing

115
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,539
doesn't seem to be if I do control if I
can find the spam

116
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,960
and there's the span and watch watch
list just crawl for spam right now

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,370
show as soon as this is done writing to
urge

118
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,580
orange now it's done writing much but
the next year on a latch

119
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,599
and put the

120
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,819
the sting on the right okay on a
right-click Andy leach

121
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,240
and gonna tell me is too big to recycle
currently deleted

122
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
and I'll say yes show is accurate Comm

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,110
view reflash now if I will do the same
thing

124
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,630
an act you are difficult but you the
French

125
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:15,630
you say that it was not gone is that
what you people tell me

126
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,130
laminne yes it is

127
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,460
it takes about 14 chechans and then it's
gone

128
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,549
now dismay shem like a small matter but
this is a really big matter for people

129
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,160
in the recovery or computer French

130
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,539
sure to go back to my slides and was
play some games here

131
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,598
by

132
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,510
which 'em

133
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,589
each at all

134
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,339
do which might have to pull the shot put
it back in group go toward

135
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,819
so I showed you that charm art

136
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:56,319
Chanel distance data does not vanish
after

137
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,380
in you normally when you delete it
there's this whole science in whole game

138
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,949
is recovering deleted data which we all
do a lot of

139
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:05,520
and their companies that do in such and
of course the way catch criminals all

140
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,880
time

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,600
criminals will do something bad many
will do something foolish like Dragon

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,339
recycle bin think it's gone

143
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,700
and she can look final is great evidence
on the drive so we've gotten accustomed

144
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,620
to this sharp high-quality arm

145
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,500
situation in computer forensics respect
to make an image a hard-driving at all

146
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,070
the data

147
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,800
the old era in the new data and we
expect people to be many copies of that

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,750
have exactly the same file the seemingly
bypass computer forensics is repeatable

149
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,720
it has been a luxury we have enjoyed
computer forensics for a while and that

150
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
game is over

151
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,810
anyway your cover your day to these are
fun tools for Cooper for PC industry

152
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,439
over the Mac

153
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,080
will totally bring back your deleted
files larger story on magnetic disks

154
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,060
and North companies like this that will
bring back your data even if you drive

155
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,959
fails to rebuild it not make a lot of
money doing that

156
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,268
I'm missing you introduce company the
people there are very happy

157
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:58,360
they're like they're working they're
very advanced the road a lot of company

158
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,040
was to go out and learn all the new
stuff about every new storage device

159
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,360
including SSD's

160
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,440
so let's talk about SSD's SSD's are not
a small matter

161
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,790
in this chart the SSD's are the pale
blue which is a small fraction market

162
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,029
around now that is growing and growing
angelos can be forty percent of the hard

163
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,850
drive market soon

164
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,290
so it's not hard drives are not going
away we're gonna remain the cheapest way

165
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,439
to store a lot of data

166
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,470
but SSD's are going to be more and more
popular and not only for being faster

167
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,700
but for using less power

168
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,500
show we're going to have a lot of them
but there's a fundamental difference

169
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,640
between hard drives necessities

170
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,680
and hard drives you read my data
typically for kilobytes at a time

171
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,050
if you wanna clean a secular rate right
on top of it with no problem

172
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:42,579
SSD's must be raged before you right on
top of them

173
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,819
and unfortunately you cannot erase one
page

174
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,630
you have to arrange one block which is a
128 pages

175
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,779
and you can't just go on here asian
blocs all the bloody time because you

176
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,180
can only go to a certain number erase
cycles

177
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,349
before the SSD is used up the number of
sync ordered

178
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,490
is 10,000 cycles people church more but
it is enough to people worry about this

179
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,350
quite a bit

180
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,940
and therefore you think about something
like a log file the keeps on adding a

181
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,680
couple lines

182
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,300
saving it adding a couple lines and
saving it that's a lot rewrites to the

183
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
same file

184
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,010
every time you do that it would have to
be racial 128 blocks

185
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,100
sure that would really wear out your SSD
show they don't do that

186
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,380
what they do is if you buy art 320

187
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,459
gigabyte SSD they give you 10 or 20
percent more storage than you paid for

188
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:35,709
don't tell you and the controller
silently swaps out those empty blocks

189
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,979
when necessary so even the drive appears
to be 99 percent full to you

190
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,829
it is not fall and it's easy for them to
find whole pages told blocks used to

191
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,140
have been used yet

192
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,120
shortly racist a minute really hashed
you sure if you store small file

193
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,050
and then you get a few eyes to it and
store it again he put it in a completely

194
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,000
different block

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,470
and marched other block anymore erase
that block actually really hatch

196
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,470
this is called wear leveling and it has
allotted very disturbing

197
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,149
effects want them is you try to write
trick block like block 100 on your SST

198
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,420
you can computer glitch in the command
put the steering lock 100

199
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,120
and your computer goes back later to
read much in block 100 it off I did

200
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,420
but it never went black 100% he might
block 10030

201
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,229
annisten internal table inside the SSD
on firmware

202
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,160
that knows that the computer does not
know that so if you wanna make a french

203
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,410
chick

204
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,720
image an SSD usual I want to get every
block from the first block to the last

205
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,380
block

206
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,480
that's not what you reading you're
reading some random portrayal blotch

207
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,459
which may or may not include those
blocked all

208
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,399
and if you wanna racin SSD by writing on
topic you can write 0 jerry plotkin

209
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,209
first bought it last block

210
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:50,388
and you did not get them all and you
don't even know which one you got

211
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:54,070
such Conklin fun if that's not enough
under daily is changing

212
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,000
well the SAT is plugged in without you
doing anything in French agree that use

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,560
this thing all the hardware great
blocker to ensure you don't alter the

214
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
drive all your

215
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,910
reading it but the SSD alters even
without you really it's just my power

216
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,110
being on because a garbage collection

217
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,790
now normally a hard drive
internationalists he does not even know

218
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,180
when you delete a file

219
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,829
you just make a mark in the file table
but the drive itself doesn't know what

220
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:18,269
your file

221
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:21,970
people and does not know those sectors
no longer in use but as this disease

222
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,829
could really benefit from knowing that

223
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:26,560
because they really have to control
issue race process in the first place

224
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,260
it's slow in the second place

225
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,569
it wears out the drive show the
controller wants to know when things are

226
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,610
to be raised

227
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,700
and not to erase them just before you
write which would make things slow

228
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,480
but to carefully plan went to a racial
this is called garbage collection

229
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,760
so if you support the TRIM command in
your operating system and the firmware

230
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,260
and the SSD then the SSD is to hold
every time a final year aged

231
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,760
and then it can put it in the queue to
be clean up with this garbage collection

232
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,750
show

233
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,529
the spin culture of corrosion I find a
better quality reparation as our minds

234
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:58,970
we ran Ramage

235
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,750
volatile I like a liquid that ball tells
me to be stored in RAM

236
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,880
when the power goes off it vanishes if
you store it in on SSD

237
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,000
when you deleted it will spontaneously
vanish under the right conditions

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,170
so anyway on alright

239
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,279
actually I'm a little bit early so I
think I'm pretty sure this one

240
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,529
um here's more fun demo if you go on the
Mac

241
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,410
you can we go to my guest up okay

242
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,319
I've got if folder here

243
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,930
I'm span spam reject this is another
folder or four files called Spain

244
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,040
I'm just gonna me a copy of that folder

245
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,819
right down here and she there goes in
about five seconds making a copy

246
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,310
that folder which contains a gigabyte
expand just like the 1i was drawn last

247
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:49,979
one

248
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,089
now the Mac Book Air users nothing but
ashes tease truck now created a folder

249
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:55,240
here

250
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,139
which has five files each 210 megabytes
in size

251
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:04,110
full the Birch Bay now I'm gonna run a
data recovery tool called

252
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,240
Disk Drill Hall which I

253
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,040
thought I put down here I could find it
but if I didn't understand ago here

254
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,579
find it just drill

255
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:18,769
okay their glorious just rolled

256
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,050
I'm used the free version okay

257
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:28,019
expand this and you she here's my entire
mcintosh hard drive almost 500 gigs

258
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,860
a glorious day to so I'm gonna go in
here

259
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,160
I'm gonna delete those files shift

260
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,050
doing we had recommended trash pardon me
this is a Mac

261
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,719
March going in the trash now they're no
longer in that folder

262
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,880
now I'm going to empty the trash

263
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,560
which i think is not really necessary
but shorter pretty or yes in a certain

264
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,000
going like this or can I delete those
files

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,370
elect writer covering this is on
Macintosh HD

266
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,740
I'm going to be a quick skin which takes
about 40 seconds

267
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,570
and we'll see what happens chick and
thus remember this number is 208

268
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,350
an maybe remember that doesn't really
matter here

269
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,709
abut are no files found get knocked down
it's getting it hard to structure this

270
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,910
by the way skinny entire 500 gigabyte
hard drive

271
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,329
which is another reason why you get
ashaji's the rock this is

272
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:26,420
very fast less than one minute just got
a whole five engage in recover all the

273
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,750
Deleted Files

274
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,670
anyway it's been too slow for me johnnie
but they're gonna background we proceed

275
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,050
here

276
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,139
up thing to such beat-up yep okay

277
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:39,089
there it's done should use urge salmon

278
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,370
desktop spam

279
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,880
and there's for those five files one of
them has already vanished forever

280
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,180
which is interesting and you do this a
few times

281
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,239
the eight years to resolve me doing this
five times early

282
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,380
couple days ago at Starbucks in message

283
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,680
some other file sometimes vanish quickly
but most of them are gonna have to 30

284
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,569
minutes and never take more minutes 60
minutes before all five files are gone

285
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:05,230
so

286
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,169
the time it takes for those files should
vanish is a random

287
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:12,250
unpredictable and can be up to an our

288
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,819
if you put them in a folder on your
desktop on a Mac

289
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,619
as we will see under other conditions
you can take different about it I'm sure

290
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,079
a course share in a PC chips for over 15
check-ins

291
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,300
on the Mac it takes a random time 30
minutes to an hour and I did not have

292
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,820
any pattern I don't know it's got a
clock

293
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,100
and is waiting for top of the hour every
hour trying to clean up the garbage

294
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,959
or what it's doing it's very odd art

295
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,470
show up we saw about developing on the
PC already saw this

296
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,549
now you can turn tram of in a PC if you
want you with this FSU chill command

297
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:49,299
in Windows 7 you can't return on of

298
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:54,590
I'm it's on by default our so here's
what it takes election command work

299
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,799
you have to run your are your drive has
to be said

300
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,918
and it has to be running in camo not
ideal Asian motivate isn't idem relation

301
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,450
motive

302
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,220
cannot understand the TRIM command will
not know when files are deleted and

303
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,020
therefore they will not evaporate

304
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,760
you gotta have a relatively new in jail
the newest generation SSD's obituary she

305
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,770
didn't have this you got to run a new
operating system windows 7 or Mac 10

306
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,530
points 6

307
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,450
I'm and if you run on a Mac you have to
use Apple branded SSD Xtreme is not

308
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,510
supported for other

309
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,169
pledged SSD is all there are some hacks
that work partially in some versions are

310
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:29,039
the Mac

311
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,230
but they are not very reliable and Apple
keeps fighting back it should allay

312
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,610
jailbreaking an eye-catcher

313
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,110
you're trying to defeat Apple's plancher
on

314
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,610
and if you you should external drive
that USB no trim

315
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,379
if you use an external she arms seniors
does he drive

316
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,570
it can in principle support the tram PCI
expression raid

317
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,840
again no trim so whether the rehab
richer not just kinda goofy

318
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,610
now tourism I thought this is really
important thing motivating our teaching

319
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,719
French Porsche

320
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,419
and you know I've been through something
several by French courses in my fridge

321
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:00,809
if teachers are talking about this

322
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,620
expert witnesses right forensic
scientists are expert witnesses we're

323
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,159
not like

324
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,840
other witnesses in court other witnesses
have to talk about what they saw they

325
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,899
say I saw this guy shoot somebody

326
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,049
and that's the guy but if they wanna
talk about the

327
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:18,059
well do you think he was angry wish I'm
not a psychologist I can have an opinion

328
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,460
because you can't have an opinion in
court just the facts but an expert can

329
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,440
have opinions

330
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,660
but opinions must be based on experience
sure

331
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,140
expert witness want to have an opinion
initially oh I know that's true because

332
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,280
I read a book

333
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,980
it touched that's not acceptable a
teacher told me that that's also not

334
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,370
acceptable has to be based on really
experienced so you have to do a lot of

335
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,239
testing in forensics you have to be able
to say

336
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,750
I know it's true because I tested and
that's what works

337
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,210
you can trust anybody else you want
called up in court

338
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,360
she got a deal just think so arm

339
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,840
that's the problem here if you want to
know whether it is evaporating

340
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,500
good bloody lock it depends on
everything it basically depends on the

341
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,630
hardware the operating system the biatch

342
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,960
and the firmware on that drive and is
not documented by the manufacture

343
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,070
typically

344
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,780
show really if you want to know you're
going to have to use the real drive

345
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,210
orbiting one in the exact same model and
run some tests on edge

346
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,700
in the short run here to find out
whether it really that video to your

347
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
conditions

348
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,870
but I do know this is already affected
to pressure China just heard people talk

349
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,629
to me about how the image a drive

350
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,490
and exactly the md5 hash in the image
again and get a different answer

351
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,510
and this is very bad not what you want
you want to delete same thing holding

352
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,100
still it's what we got used to you

353
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,520
and SSD's you often don't and it's
pretty obvious that this is one part of

354
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,090
the reason why

355
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,320
so I worked all here to play with a Mac
question the tool

356
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,689
is probably more usual for sure his work
but a little less dramatic than these

357
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,850
nice graphic things we can wash thing in
hex editor stuff show

358
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,120
on I wish to learn what obstruction

359
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,168
let me just run this thing it's a
text-only jewel but at this point all

360
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,400
this thing does his first you have to
make a one gigabyte partition

361
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,429
label SSD and then gunship this jewel
run into the command line and then you

362
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,090
can usually right to an Ashes d

363
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,139
and watch the deal evaporates you for
Dutch

364
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,230
so let me a just run this thing up here

365
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,940
I put it in a folder called even running
shoe no effect on me that bigger

366
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,030
Irish she there 1 well it's big enough
to retire

367
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,129
can you see it back there okay fair
enough

368
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,140
bikes are honest thing Europe ashford

369
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,900
okay there's where you have to do before
you get it working

370
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,460
and then here's the options show what
I'm gonna do as I'm going to prepare

371
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,360
I can be used the your age my volume and
format it

372
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,199
with the very newest operating
brainwashed Mac file system which is

373
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,000
journaling

374
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,929
HFS plush that's the latest and greatest
and then I'm gonna right shin test files

375
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,549
on that boy

376
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:50,070
the test files are just a bunch of up
files like my spam volume one way to

377
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,530
reach

378
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,678
was awful age want all these wonderful
season is your characters

379
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,340
Chuvash in the drive this is going to
use dd to just grab

380
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,470
about eighty random characters evenly

381
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,640
not random evenly spaced across that
drives gonna give me a sample

382
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,740
the whole gigabyte of data that I could
see and that's what it's got these

383
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,690
characters that has got a BCD

384
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,740
this is just grabbing 80 or 100
characters in a pattern across the whole

385
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,659
drive so I can see how much data is on
there and I feel the whole thing up a

386
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:18,580
text files

387
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,908
now I'm gonna delete those files d the
social issues the command line to lead

388
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:22,780
to delete them

389
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,940
an inch again and again and they're gone
except its

390
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,350
left a few QW now this

391
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,129
is attacked about what happens when you
make another partition

392
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,549
on the Mac and you can a partition is
not containing operating system as well

393
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:43,908
the deleting happens instantaneously so
fast I can't measure the time within

394
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,570
about 12 seconds

395
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,520
and it is not complete it doesn't get it
all this by the way is not very

396
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,230
surprising if you think about it because
it got those groups

397
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,179
128 pages and gonna racial group and is
probably a few

398
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:01,039
of those files that were just partly
feeling something and decided not to

399
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,870
raise it now but wait till later because
it might still have

400
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,168
leadership track to a file to put in
there it might not be the most wise time

401
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:09,090
to racial

402
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,668
just not too surprising is not complete
but which other

403
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:16,400
puts on a good clean fun is if you go
and Dom

404
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,770
I think it is F by UCF it'll now

405
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,840
reform and that volume you're a shit and
Meiji HDFS plush

406
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,689
that's not journaling which is perfectly
fine format but just not elitist Mac

407
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,450
format

408
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,630
now if you break those files

409
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,059
and then you can come and then usually
dome

410
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,260
any ganem they're still there they
aren't going anywhere

411
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,340
you can wait as long as you like it's
just like a hard right now

412
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,020
because you didn't use the very latest
file system and I could show you on the

413
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,389
PC I think I won't bother

414
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,450
it seems like the outboard if you take
the PC

415
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,919
SSD and format it that 32 the same thing
happens

416
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,659
it will never evaporation show it
depends

417
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:00,970
if you wanna say what did appear she can
count on to vanish and you can't count

418
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,840
the stage to eliminate vanishes

419
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,168
you can't count on it all to vanish

420
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:09,500
and Shaw basically like just a little
bit more complicated

421
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,610
of course or first paper published about
this stuff so this may be

422
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,418
end of computer French ish and I don't
think that's fair I think my ping and

423
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,809
not that I'm a lawyer anything I'm not
an expert witness I this teacher I'm

424
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,730
butter classes you guys that were in my
penis does not ruin computer forensics

425
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,409
just demote computer forensics from this
mathematical science where they had this

426
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,450
thing called a perfect imager the dish

427
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,500
down to every other kind of projects
like you gotta

428
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,470
bloodstain her finger prick you can
analyze that fingerprint once you cannot

429
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,590
bring another person and analyze the
fingerprint from zero and get exactly

430
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,799
same answer

431
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:45,220
tough hit you that there's just easier
show

432
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,590
we're just have to be like everyone else
you can measure shot even go to testify

433
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,789
in court she I did a good job measuring
here's the entire body is not true that

434
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:54,110
someone can start from here with me your
children

435
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,270
completely duplicate my work anyway arm

436
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,340
or so that's the main thing

437
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,480
chillier but I thought I'd have a little
more time

438
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,270
which I do show anybody got a question
about this d-bag racin

439
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:12,418
anything yeah

440
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,559
tree yes you gonna delete files and she
managed

441
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,590
it must have tram for the drive won't
know otherwise you only deleted when you

442
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,209
format the drive

443
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,360
yeah thing the

444
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,639
will drive for you any where

445
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,049
I the year or just it

446
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:36,830
on the only thing I know is its function

447
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,949
because I'm I put some options in the
stool to

448
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,679
arm trim trim on of and the only work
for older versions a Mac on New Bern

449
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,700
versions a word about half the time

450
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,179
that's why there's a bunch from Naples
to you and I don't know how well they

451
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,039
work

452
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,520
it be fun chip get one of those animus
toward see I don't have

453
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,750
all has a built-in Mac this a good point
but I do know

454
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,980
the two were to my older Mac and I got a
new map it at least version West Ham

455
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,909
the jewel overworked so I think mac is
kicking back

456
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:10,919
Apple keeps altering a system yeah

457
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,610
101 West Inc

458
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,990
after very good question I do not know
engine I tried USB sticks

459
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,500
and there's no evaporation but then I
found out treated USB doesn't support

460
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,419
ranch let's not surprised

461
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,710
if you could not an SD card internally
so goes to shade I would think the same

462
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,010
thing would happen but you would have to
try and see it but it depends on the

463
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,908
model much

464
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:36,710
that's a very good point that's why we
need a lot more people tested stuff

465
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,789
I've only done on a couple systems and
there are hundreds by the way had to buy

466
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:40,789
three

467
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:44,640
as HD trippy she forgot one would work
the others even with the most modern

468
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,299
operating system in every by a shitty
just right did not ever had any beverage

469
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,580
by the way another you think this post
to your SST faster

470
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,139
but I tried it and measuring the time it
takes to write clean I can't find any

471
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,309
difference

472
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:00,658
so I don't I probably need a more subtle
performance measurement to see what the

473
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,950
benefit is that the stream anyway

474
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,140
making it last bomb right kinda believe
make it past Rinne the Cheshire

475
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,679
anything else I got a totally different
topic

476
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,210
show you which is probably even more
important and very exciting

477
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,510
or I'm i cant talk your two years ago

478
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,600
about dial service attacks and after
that

479
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,740
up black at hacker contact me on twitter

480
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,840
and should at a pretty good talk you
uncover shock stressed

481
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,439
what do you see backtrack Linux for what
do you mean as well I guess ain't

482
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,370
watchin abuse

483
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,860
got to use Slackware or you know where
he said

484
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,860
and why do I have to Slackware because I
got your shocks trash

485
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,789
russia's shocks trash now this is an old
attack from 2008

486
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:45,059
I heard about this thing you all heard
about this in a podcast every

487
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:48,460
chichi P U Z device unit is going to be
destroyed

488
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,440
is the end of the world but some are
nothing ever came up I heard about it

489
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,190
you are trying to find zip code I like a
time machine code didn't work

490
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,929
and I played around it for a while
nothing ever happened I just forgot

491
00:27:57,929 --> 00:27:58,549
about each

492
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:02,440
Microsoft patch something related to
this and I thought that was the end of

493
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,779
discussion no I used to take out a
survey last week near Kb

494
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:08,779
brother picture my girlfriend I note
that your bed talk trash

495
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:12,380
and Joe this tool you can kill something
it won't even come back up

496
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,760
you can destroy service completely with
this thing supposedly so I said well

497
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,710
this all sounds like not just to me

498
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,630
but I'm looked into it might happen is
it was developed in 2008

499
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,659
an immersion podcast talking about it
and then the developer

500
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,779
died so he never got a chance to go to
the

501
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:31,570
security-conscious run a dog and pony
show like I'm about you

502
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,960
and explain to us all how awesome it is
to get people to care and so nobody

503
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,750
cared so nobody fixed

504
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,070
and it still works today five years old

505
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,428
show let me show you shop stress in all
its glory by the way the idea behind

506
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:44,169
shock church

507
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:47,610
is incredibly simple if you do wish Jim
Sherak

508
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,928
ac you can't send the ac with a small
window shash

509
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,970
like 0 or four by each that major's

510
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,059
hey I wanna make connection wake I'm
busy hold on I get back to you later

511
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:03,289
but I am gonna download that file really
AM and this will hang up the server

512
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:07,470
waiting for the pressure that connection
and it turns out that you can do a lot

513
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,610
of damage

514
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,428
and I got it working pretty well you'd
have to run Slackware

515
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:15,720
claiming it must stop this one works
pretty one virtual machines so

516
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,890
here's my Slackware

517
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:26,890
and for targeted I'm going to use this
Windows 7 machine which gigabyte RAM

518
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,179
orange and I know this is currently used
by black ass to take a real servers

519
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,659
and effects basically anything that uses
TCP

520
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:42,080
is not joking each not is not a bug

521
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,059
this is not a few jury flawed you can
fix this is in the design MTG p

522
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,490
however as usual it in the
implementation that the suffering comes

523
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,320
up short each

524
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,178
get task manager running here she she a
burden to my windows 7 targeted ish

525
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,830
show you see here the sheep use down 20
percent

526
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,610
the memory being used is about half to
the gig

527
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,610
and I got one and a half day just sit
there and he's the servers not heavily

528
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,840
burdened all right now

529
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,639
now in order to this thing to run in
Slackware

530
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,890
you have to you do two things: me to
show your

531
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,890
dish you have to attack

532
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,840
many open porch on the server and you
attack them from any shortage

533
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,970
now you could go get a botnet or
something but you don't even have to you

534
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:27,360
can

535
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,649
fake a botnet you could send package
that come from multiple local source

536
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:32,260
addresses

537
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,750
you can get it from DHCP as long as you
have something that will answer

538
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,179
big %eh with the Thep replies

539
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,710
now the original designer the jewel
ritual to do that and I could not make

540
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,909
it work so I brought my own

541
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:47,669
on which is not hard at all should just
keep the script

542
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:51,220
its part ploy sure do just you catch

543
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,320
her ploy choose the one time use in

544
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,070
I mean it even simpler couple days ago
there there it is

545
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,250
I'm speakership each should control
plush

546
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,490
now cannot soccer anyway is just a few
lines here it's on like my page always

547
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,809
does listen for RP question and Give
Your Heart reply

548
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:13,230
arm always giving it the same actor Josh
so my machine can have many mac Address

549
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,880
is this is

550
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,169
really important because you have to
attack for many IP addresses

551
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:20,730
hand if you attack to the main IP
address to the machine is really using

552
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,419
you will kill the attacker

553
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:27,580
to the attacker is not protected in any
way from this attack the attackers using

554
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,658
tgp she didn't kill your attacker buyer
killed the charred

555
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:34,330
if you don't do it this way so what you
do is you have a real IP address to

556
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,520
using for communications and then you
have a whole

557
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,720
shy 2528 fake IP addresses which are
sending packets out

558
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,299
from there but you're not actually
letting the operating system

559
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:48,700
no that you make a TCP connections there
so it does not burden the Slackware

560
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,000
operating system but maintaining those
happen connections

561
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,049
anyway we're in this thing starch work

562
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,399
in our gothic art thing running now I'm
gonna start the attack

563
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:02,709
and this should be good clean fun arm

564
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,240
shock I meet script called soccer starts
the attack

565
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,990
orange their reaction out shooting 2000
connections per second

566
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,399
the CPU is up to 100 percent the RAM use

567
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:17,549
is increasing and if you look at the arc

568
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,769
the art bar yeah should be sure to much
resolutions there were maybe jodie

569
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:24,090
remember him from before delicious men
to this she right after a long attack

570
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,240
anyway this is doing just what I should
show on the right is the attacker

571
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,340
Channing three or four thousand
connections per second

572
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,070
from modern 28 short porch to about 10
destination Portugal about enlisting

573
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,399
services on a machine FTP and Telnet

574
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,928
web page in all that jazz and

575
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:45,010
alright against nothing important I dare

576
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:50,500
so now up to 900 megs and you can see in
the scandal graphic as the RAM is just

577
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,549
going up and up and up

578
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:55,879
and this may not be exciting that we may
just let this go over well come back to

579
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,789
it

580
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:00,649
but the interesting thing now they tell
you a punchline edge you can run a gram

581
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:04,768
as high as you want and chill version
crashes NYJ and when you stop the attack

582
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,440
the RAM never comes back

583
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,909
it currently in use its implementation
aaron is waiting

584
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:14,860
verge it's doing something in RAM that
you ready to deliver to the other

585
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,260
machine and is waiting the window size
is your fortune can actually said

586
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,158
and it's just really have all been ran
when you drop the connection it never

587
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:24,279
comes back

588
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,080
so this is something that could be
patched on that side

589
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,769
anyway um I was not able to British GT
wat wouldn't even booed

590
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,970
but I am able to freeze its nothing
works on this end when it starts running

591
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,580
out a gram is just gonna go crazy

592
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,870
kinda good clean fun I'm really big on
the background may come back to it on

593
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,870
but kinda fun when he gets all the way
up here readers way

594
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,959
reuter 21.2 Tony go pretty fast

595
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,539
um when he goes to the top you can wash
the server died

596
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:55,140
research firm in around like we're gonna
hook yet

597
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,740
yeah you head

598
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,070
your yet more

599
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,540
no I would be very nice you're just
against the SX water bowl the hosts

600
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,679
I didn't but the course the real black
at the Commission me to do this

601
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,389
is do that all the time it takes down

602
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:16,239
everything according to him and as far
as I can tell he's right as I did

603
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,149
nothing special down a first tried it

604
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,660
I shall watch a troubled slack word
everything and I made a special week of

605
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,649
that only at 5:12 make sure am

606
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,450
but usually it works you will see what
would happen if i mean a real host for

607
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,810
to be a gym and it works just fine for
lunch or doesn't matter how much

608
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,679
we or you have at this end is just use
them up and

609
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,870
its gonna die grecian death it's kinda
fun to watch it crocodile out there

610
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,900
although I wasn't able to render my
virtual machine

611
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,310
unbelievable what he tells me is this
attack is not for wimps ship to take

612
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,070
over server do this attack

613
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,670
and real server running something
sensible like Slackware and they have to

614
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,230
really run

615
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,440
sent a powerful sherry much a connection
to it and then he says

616
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,350
georgine so they can't be W now what I
should be going on there I'm just

617
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,040
guessing

618
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,259
is your freezing machine so badly

619
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,150
that it needs a hard power off and hard
power on and that will often make sure

620
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:03,890
the jungle

621
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,640
that's one thing I can't imagine could
do anything more than that they were

622
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,480
nearly up to the part where sure all
serbian fun to watch here

623
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,410
1.7 gigs in fact it's already stopped
looking cash manager at leave

624
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,589
it looks to me like cash manager has
frozen here

625
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,470
and if I yeah yeah I can already use
mouthwash

626
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:28,980
never got a reasonably denture here they
responded a little bit to me that I'm

627
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,870
not updating a little more but notice
how the nation progress is beginning to

628
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,029
fall apart here

629
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:40,970
and yeah now it's gonna start going up
and down the RAM in the CPU will boast

630
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,029
are going up and down Chile go crazy
idea

631
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:48,520
this is arm this could be your sugar
it's a gruesome thought

632
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,460
and nobody's passion five-year show I
thought it might be fun to take us to

633
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,180
the constant

634
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,390
be engaging the usual humiliation ritual
you're getting all the vendors in

635
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,060
somebody actually cares not pictured

636
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,410
and this is I think why nobody thinks
that my didn't even know because it's

637
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,390
not that easy an attack to do but I
reluctantly structured review much

638
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,009
go I'm and and you this thing

639
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:13,040
welcome back to look at is gonna we've
gotten down into emerging stop so

640
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,540
arm I got one other thing showing

641
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,720
cuz urged all time which is what I
thought would happen

642
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,060
arm I got another role in check but I
hear some pictures from before

643
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,049
make this big sure there it is gradually
losing up

644
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,890
asch okay

645
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,220
sure they're usually climb into the sky
and when it's done

646
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,990
it church freaking out on your and I
turned off the attack here

647
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,560
which caused the sheep you got here but
the reviews just days hyper

648
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,029
which is not healthy the only thing is
gonna fix the service restart

649
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:54,850
and %uh or should now I was talking
about ipv6 because ipv6 by the way

650
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,790
is more of the same you know ipv6 here
in 1993

651
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,220
and the plan was to 100 percent the
planet by 1999

652
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,029
another that happened as you might have
noticed yep

653
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,100
their K has good that's why I have this

654
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,450
church statement here no such a greater
than 4 million

655
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,460
officially going to show the other
anyway

656
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,330
show ipv6 came out billions to be

657
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,440
fully implemented by 1999 it's not even
implemented yet

658
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,430
and all the stuff for using is John
pretty much I don't because Microsoft

659
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,540
will he be too many times to him because
he worked real hard but I V six Mike

660
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,259
shop product

661
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,760
but everything we have is just drawn
together hastily not tested and it

662
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,560
doesn't work

663
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,620
as kinda fun to blow away with every
patrol you want to try

664
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,990
its ok security is a big problem anyway
this is why we have to do it running IP

665
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,180
version 4 dresses to be measured for a
rally

666
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,879
you're actually go and North America is
expected to run addresses

667
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,330
next year so there can be no more ipv4
addresses available

668
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,750
at all lucky you can usually just the
ones which can be more show

669
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,670
ipv6 has a few more dresses so I mean
ipv6 exhaustion counter

670
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,240
this the projected date will run out
show upgrade ipv6 will give us a little

671
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,410
more breathing room here

672
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:11,370
on so this is your link local the last
thing I showed you two years ago

673
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,730
and this is your passion attack arm

674
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,550
no way this works is when you get an
address in ipv6 you don't usually do

675
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,880
with your GP or you can this is not the
most common Thep is a poor brush

676
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,560
the client good job it says I need Nyepi
the writer tells the IP

677
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,980
that's the into the transaction that
will not happen any more chilled like to

678
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,770
jump again

679
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:35,300
or chilled age bash but ipv6 it doesn't
work that way the router just sent %uh

680
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,080
periodic router advertisements

681
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,020
NHL's everybody they can hear it you
have to stop it you doing in join my

682
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,070
network created Russian join my network

683
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,690
this it goes out is pushed out from the
router and this goes out as a broadcast

684
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,710
packet although

685
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,620
it technically there's no broadcast
tonight BB 6 30 said something called

686
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,990
multi cast to all know

687
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,549
which which is essentially the same
thing so the router advertisement pack

688
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,470
it goes out you can pick it up in
Wireshark

689
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,859
and a rather advertising package goes
out to this ep 02

690
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,360
phone call one which is the broadcaster
to all nodes and rash

691
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,950
and it contains a prefix 2000 one all
this whitewash never everybody gets that

692
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,970
packet has to join that network

693
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,629
and if you send out of luck to broadcast
back at random prefixes

694
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,370
then the arm with machine has to create
all the food rations

695
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,759
and it doesn't seem like a big problem
but unfortunately its credit

696
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,010
efficient killing windows because
windows and for some reason BSD Unix

697
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,110
are incredibly inefficient creating
these addresses they can only create

698
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,580
about 5 these per second it uses 100 in
the CPU

699
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,279
don't ask me why I've never I can
imagine

700
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,680
it's got gigahertz processor all has to
do is make wanted rash

701
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,140
how hard can it be apparently can be
very hard

702
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,720
apparently could take two hundred
milliseconds at falafel CPU show

703
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,240
if you drive this thing on in 2011 is
when does change in a push the process

704
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,319
you up to 100 percent and I'll stay up
there

705
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,400
just like that shock stress is doing a
cheap you will be 100 percent forever

706
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,710
to get back for 24 hours before it ever
comes back so Microsoft patched it short

707
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:10,680
about halfway in November 2012 the thing
called the ipv6 readiness update

708
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,569
but the ipv6 readiness update is only
available for Windows 7

709
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,780
and server 2008 r2 for some reason
Microsoft did not catch their newest

710
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,960
products

711
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,140
Windows 8 ensuring 2012 probably because
they feel like it's not vulnerable

712
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,549
and the man that wrote these attack
tools also feels like it's not reliable

713
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,960
job about three weeks ago I managed to
talk to him

714
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,450
lighter to play with the stuff goes to
deny d60 naked you know I

715
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,890
work forever on the stuff we got a lab
setup show 'em

716
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,950
be a real ipv6 lab really go to the
United music

717
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:44,049
and let me try dish tools there's a new
or a flight just came out a couple

718
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:44,990
months ago

719
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,549
um in all this Dutch issues more
devastating router advertisements

720
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,470
it turns out I don't know why you would
do that sh which you can advertise

721
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,730
multiple routers and multiple route
routing table entries in the same

722
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,090
running advertisements are now

723
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,820
every single running every chargement
packet contained 17

724
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,740
route arm entries in eighteen prefixes
looks like this

725
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:10,029
goes on and on show each one in the
usual is like 25

726
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:15,240
or 35 the previous watch Asian a flood
in these are stashed as you can

727
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,979
and it has no great effect the than that
in what happened is

728
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,850
I brought my machines down real dramatic
the next time I tried it didn't work

729
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,790
they tried working try to make a video I
could make it all still much what's

730
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,450
going on my students it only works when
there's a real router in the network

731
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:33,870
as it that church do but local real
router Punjab one wrote every child in

732
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,700
every five minutes I'm putting out

733
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,830
1000 per second there's no way that one
more picture difference

734
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,020
you're wrong it's got to be the cable is
gonna be a switch gonna be some

735
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,050
adjustment

736
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:48,090
he was right that a real router network
so let me show you this town

737
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,770
this one good clean fun

738
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,320
was just take a look at your listings UN
yeah there is just

739
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,490
cheap UK now 0 finally I don't think it
after stop

740
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:02,979
they are going to stop this one well
looks like my

741
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,760
who by Mike Akers not guilty

742
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,050
or anyway rather mister brimmer that
money shop the new one and by the way

743
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,270
there's a fun thing to show you

744
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,930
and i'm glad to have a few more minutes
here because judge

745
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,200
you guys are gonna go out there and on
this car on like every other audio

746
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,310
engineer lapd

747
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,820
much which is kinda a shame because you
could be victims that knowing

748
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,980
however somebody hotels victim

749
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,260
I'm not gonna bring him down but I'm
gonna tag

750
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,620
part let me connect to the hotel network

751
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,100
right here the one at work before his
ATT wifi which i think is Starbucks over

752
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,910
my head

753
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,950
had approved shopping fruit on the ocean
it seems like I had to prove myself

754
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,419
though tell you can join if you like
join this network and see what happens

755
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,660
um or on the ATT wifi network now

756
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,720
I'm gonna send out your running
advertisements from here now

757
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,790
I'm gonna send out charm chichi
five-eighth

758
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,170
college a teacher then dude okay to do

759
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,290
some college stick to string here I'm
sitting on a network starting with those

760
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,330
letters

761
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,750
and to detect it I'm gonna run this tool
called passive discovery

762
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,130
which even up computer does create an
ipv6 address to join the network it has

763
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,980
to make sure it's not already in use

764
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,960
the address he created should have to
sender I a neighbor discovery message

765
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,440
out saying hey man I'm about to use this
address is somebody or using it

766
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,790
so I just wished for the church should
anybody actually cares the action in our

767
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,560
router advertisements

768
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,390
they will pick up here and pick up only
the ones I created here in together once

769
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,060
a chichi 5:11 a.m.

770
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,900
I guess or pretty enough do to you

771
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,610
okay traditional show me if her and she
she is a dude around here

772
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:49,340
open right password

773
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,970
or should I mentioned about

774
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:57,129
and didn't like it or for a mystical
okay

775
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,350
they're not like okay there's a couple
people on my network now

776
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:04,610
I'm gonna put this Windows 8 machine on

777
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,900
minority

778
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,080
or for the Windows 8 machine is on if
anybody else Georgia when she joined her

779
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,580
before I had about 10 people are victims
here

780
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,279
there's I'm not gonna be assured are it
depends on how many are

781
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,100
people have to be joining this network
that are running machines to running a

782
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,799
fever checks but almost every modern
operating system Dutch

783
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,690
so anyway I'm not gonna kill everybody
in them the

784
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:35,020
on that network but I am gonna chill

785
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:42,020
this machine here so just the second I
got it from the stinker project

786
00:44:53,099 --> 00:45:00,099
there are

787
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:10,540
pop

788
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:20,210
wire

789
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,549
goods coming up alright theoretically
will have a Windows 8 desktop your admit

790
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:32,999
they re ok is robert is a test of its
all crooked

791
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:36,259
everything another that matters because
it's not a very subtle attack

792
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:43,259
used so bring up

793
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,100
okay sure I know I'm not working at all
now this is important because

794
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,860
this attack sure like shock stress kills
everything

795
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,890
harbor in the world including the Mac

796
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,900
show in order to

797
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,970
for my Mac are you still need a lot more
computers to do this

798
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,819
because I couldn't using virtual
machines because it'll kill the host

799
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,150
underneath the virtual machine

800
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,610
which is not the point but then I got a
USB NIC this the trigger word from Jeff

801
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,090
Korea

802
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:17,570
was a really interesting guy can class
to show she might be six attacks

803
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:21,480
and he brought a whole bunch USB next
because if you have USB connection

804
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,530
virtual change

805
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:26,230
get this book and I can now say connect

806
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,160
tool in English and then what happens is
it a virtual machine

807
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,810
and the virtual machine kitchen package
out but they were interpreted by the

808
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,380
host

809
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,540
as USB traffic and they're not kill the
host

810
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,290
this is actually very nice should now my

811
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:44,590
virtual machine has another naked the
host is not know about

812
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:50,190
opera down here sweetie results it's now
got a thing called he's won

813
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,520
now this is just a cable connecting to
computer she really is no router enough

814
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,230
and sure there's no IP version 4 dresses
but I don't care cuz this is my dear

815
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,300
injection attack

816
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,720
sure they're connected to each other and
if I do from

817
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,339
that fake router again I'm gonna send
out arm

818
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,880
AB AB she dude in

819
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:18,880
and when I do I should she on this
Windows 8 machine

820
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,770
all pop for me i sat out the wrong
address

821
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:30,940
are setting up the wireless network I
want shit out the wired network

822
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:37,940
teeth one their are okay

823
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,100
this is the case a death I should not
router advertisements from that when ex

824
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,690
machina

825
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,360
this Windows 8 machine gonna and Iran
are configured you should she

826
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,630
right there addresses starting

827
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,720
ABC do that means this machine

828
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,990
is also configure a response to rather
just and

829
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,930
the trick to this attack issue must
first have a normal rather the network

830
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,600
it really you can simulate that

831
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,270
that's what this is this sense outrun
water advertisement per second

832
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,400
are just plain ordinary raho you join a
network

833
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,510
you must do that first or Windows aid

834
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,220
membership for 2012 are not vulnerable
this is the thing that the designer this

835
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,339
tool did not know

836
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,770
only my student figure it out convinced
me this will enable demonstrators

837
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:24,330
so now I can run that legal flood which
is flooded

838
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:28,250
router to shake sh he's won

839
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,530
and that's all it takes not gonna send
out a lot a package

840
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:35,760
I might

841
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,710
yeah I thought I might do an IP
configure let this thing run

842
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,240
it still frozen hope you will do it with
a stick about twenty or thirty seconds

843
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:50,240
before we see the result on doors
windows 8

844
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:05,080
17 eighty in

845
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:21,560
urge taking a bit longer than I thought
it would

846
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:31,720
up there we go the blue screen again

847
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:38,720
the projector catches

848
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,810
sometimes it does and the same thing
happens to Windows

849
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:47,480
sugar 2012 and the same thing happens to
the Apple

850
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,849
the only and the same thing happens well

851
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:54,359
I the previous attack PST UNIX is
horrible and I should be the bug report

852
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,730
it was just ignored

853
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,260
so I maginnis stovall what you all are
not sure anyway

854
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:04,060
arm this is work is my next ever try to
get Microsoft to pass this however some

855
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,650
people might not worry about this

856
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,150
because this is a layer to attack you
have to be on the same

857
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,170
are layer 2 network you cannot be trap

858
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:15,930
did not suck stress can attack you over
the Internet using TCP

859
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,328
so therefore attack this really
attacking from reason your local network

860
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:22,430
but one person reading this article
every machine at work

861
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:26,190
that's why i think its your ish another
reason why Shirish is if you

862
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,390
everyone's going to the clock so people
are taking a physical servers and

863
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:34,328
putting up on Amazon he to see your
Microsoft Azure when most cloud services

864
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:37,589
which are typically getting there are
you getting much machines that are all

865
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:38,839
the same layer 2 network

866
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,230
Iran teacher rapids in it's a virtual
machine

867
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,640
judge me least you skinny ipv6 native
they took that away which is kinda rude

868
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,279
but anyway

869
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,960
that's a virtual machine and Iran chest
like the 1i showed you

870
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,970
to she will share some earlier too and I
found one hundred eighty

871
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:57,410
other customers on the scene where to
lay with me and I could kill them all

872
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:01,759
and any one of them could kill me and
this is what people told me this year

873
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,030
you meant real server unsure try and
they just put you in Iraq in the switch

874
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,020
with everybody else this is your problem

875
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:10,380
if you read a virtual shirley's do the
same thing virtually put you on a

876
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,150
virtual switch

877
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,210
show actually tax to kill they are ready
to see where to your knowledge harmless

878
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,369
as one might imagine

879
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:21,200
anyway

880
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,560
orange show

881
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,730
we go back much larger ship a lot more
sure whether she does the trick

882
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,349
which I'm try make sure everybody knows
about how to make the shit at work you

883
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:31,839
have to

884
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,990
first-century normal router
advertisements should actually

885
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,089
automatically configures

886
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:39,599
normal address that creates the
vulnerable condition which makes me

887
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,410
think

888
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:44,190
the Microsoft must I'm just guessing
Microsoft appears to put a defense

889
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,319
mechanism in place because one thing is
true

890
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,420
before the patch windows 7

891
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:53,210
which is configured thousand addresses
act that only because one hundred they

892
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,410
say there's an official in

893
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,710
letter to be more than 100 automatic
addresses and that's true in all a

894
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,609
typical 200

895
00:51:58,609 --> 00:52:02,720
but continues to suffer and I'll she
didn't actually block the process thus

896
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,520
the problem that they blocked the result

897
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,930
anyway but apparently they put in some
kind of safety switch

898
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,060
the notices when you're under flood but
it only works if you want

899
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,170
actually network that using that
approach anyway so hopefully my total

900
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:16,790
picture

901
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:20,359
arm that's how you perform this attack
first mission to a fake router

902
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:24,319
virtue nation other flood and that shit
than Windows does a gruesome death

903
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,079
on and by the way it kills the windows
each I'm tablet

904
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,400
the day service archie or why Rush kills
Android phones

905
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,720
over wireless you're pretty much kills
everything I be able tested on

906
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:43,629
arm and up i'm happier more people want
to test it misses the problem by the way

907
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,920
this kind of attack

908
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,119
is pretty annoying because he doesn't
works on all switches to kill so mine

909
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:49,640
detection

910
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,529
used at my USB next can handle it and
some other switches I put it you can

911
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,490
lead to problems like a flame thrower
you kill

912
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,700
all the devices on your network you have
to get to buy used or strong enough to

913
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,578
withstand the attack enough he delivered
to the one wanna kill

914
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:08,440
shoot actual playing around so here's
here's a list of what I did

915
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,700
when there's a church bell tolled I
insurers argue dodge

916
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,810
Mac question freezes it doesn't give you
the blue screen of death gives the

917
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:18,460
spinning circle of death he can do
anything you set your general power down

918
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,950
and yet to do to research to get back to
normal kills the iPad and the iPad Mini

919
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,509
um and a

920
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:30,500
killed a droid phone sometimes Ubuntu
Linux

921
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,740
in Cali winik's getting based Linux
doesn't care at all children right on as

922
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,470
if nothing is happening I looked all
that up as the example I was gonna bring

923
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,899
money to do it I didn't bring

924
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,109
had not juncture the I wanna chill

925
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:46,140
Apple and Microsoft and everybody else
look it can be done

926
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,960
you can make an operating system just
shrug this off like it's not happening

927
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,849
Ubuntu Linux does it well its open
source for crying out loud whether to go

928
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:54,900
steal the code

929
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,250
anyway I'm they they don't have the
shuttle is lame stuff

930
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,700
the patch by the way 2007 Server 2008
has the effect that the thing

931
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,040
threes is completely during the flood
the mouse won't move nothing work but

932
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,029
after the flood stops recovers I don't
think that's a very good patch

933
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:13,190
but very good push me to death the
freezing for hours afterwards

934
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,980
we're used to I've written a lot of
videos about these things in a lot about

935
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,200
descriptions about how do these attacks
on a Web site on

936
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,649
show protection you turn off ipv6
entirely

937
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:26,450
that will protect you with this is going
retro I mean the world the job BB

938
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,580
section for more services rely on it

939
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,069
on you could turn off router discovery
which means that your she will no longer

940
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,109
automatically configure these addresses

941
00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:37,369
that is probably the best solution in my
opinion for sure because you don't want

942
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:40,160
your servers automatically give your
address is anyone up can you address

943
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,540
your shirt for show

944
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,710
for for clients though you probably do
you want to join a record registration

945
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,200
region you want each EP so people can
easily connect your network

946
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,299
so then you can use Trish arm you can
use a firewall

947
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,890
project for the Windows fireball
built-in can block program program dir

948
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,730
advertisement you just say don't accept
the router advertisements they don't

949
00:54:58,730 --> 00:54:59,700
come from the official

950
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,379
uprooted rash my real router now that by
the way she easily bypassed because you

951
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,800
it's both the from address

952
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,130
this is not TCP traffic this is

953
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,500
broadcast unique ass traffic show you
completely fake from Russian wanted it

954
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,400
but still thats

955
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,700
a possible some short you get are a
guard just goes your product or a guard

956
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,250
their proprietary solution lish

957
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,690
on this will you specify a porch

958
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:25,770
on the switch nationally portal out to
inject router advertisement in the

959
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:26,770
network

960
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,050
this is like Cisco sticky porch in other
solutions they've had not a problem with

961
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:30,640
that

962
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,540
is it revealed by passion mark howser
the diarrhea Qwest Communications

963
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,290
congress the road is to live in using it
for other chicks majority bypassed it

964
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:41,540
all you have to do is break make your
router advertisement packaging 22

965
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,349
package

966
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:45,460
and I'll see all right cash rather
Akbari Garhwal all

967
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,339
this is a portion of the case web
application firewalls meeting held in

968
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:49,049
TAC

969
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,770
the first player to bench is like pic
attention it a little bit about your

970
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:53,240
stops

971
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,680
this particular it actual but the
slightest variation it actual class

972
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,649
right to its ok

973
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,880
the defense's need to get better at
least there are some defenses

974
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,589
arm for their worst part

975
00:56:04,589 --> 00:56:08,599
shows you what any other stuff that's
all changed last rental on

976
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,730
videos and such an instruction shall do
all these attacks

977
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,490
especially at Slackware when you really
need the instructions that could be

978
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,629
weeks ago trying to give up this black
cat laugh at me on twitter

979
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,030
32 she would make it work early works
managed to get on the shirt will

980
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,089
motivated me i preciate

981
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:28,640
any questions about anything

982
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:35,640
or well I guess that shit perot

983
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,939
only only hurts when I have islam an
oldie chichi the very first running

984
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:54,940
yes

985
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:59,109
I'll you from thing and also the iPad

986
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,210
have the delightful property you can
tell

987
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,839
the is automatically configure ipv6
addresses from the

988
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:10,150
outside but you can find on the inside
which is actually what I devices like

989
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,710
devices have ipv6

990
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,019
but they have a truly knowledge you know
they you can't really

991
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:20,649
use it but it is there you can tell like
what you hear I can tell

992
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,859
kitchen up the package like
intelligently listed even if there's no

993
00:57:23,859 --> 00:57:25,549
way inside the top interesting to see it

994
00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:30,329
between they are using some compliments
of Earnhardt whether in fact I V six

995
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:30,819
capable

996
00:57:30,819 --> 00:57:33,220
which is probably true almost anybody
these days they just take some

997
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,029
replaceable

998
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:41,029
compliment plug it in them

999
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,029
where the somebody else coming them
