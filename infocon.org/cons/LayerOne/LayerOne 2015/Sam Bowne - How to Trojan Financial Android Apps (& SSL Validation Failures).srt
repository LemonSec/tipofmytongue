1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:10,490
acts up at this early in a second

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,620
welcome the next time we have a couple

3
00:01:00,030 --> 00:02:00,640
first time ever and I had to apologize
to the students for quite a lot of it

4
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,800
because what's in the book is all
fiction there's

5
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,579
her practice is well-defined an app
developers just completely ignore them

6
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:13,850
and don't do any of it for example off
fictional product to make sure possible

7
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,450
through us and apathetic a customer
service likes a Twitter without handling

8
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,940
and Twitter password but nobody uses the
old last right through the handle the

9
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,239
password and rolling around reach
dealers I can't find an example of

10
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,540
anybody actually using a bother writing
it but maybe for some future generation

11
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,500
of people that care more about security
number one because cheaper it is much

12
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,320
much less safe than iOS to an outrageous
extent entirely because of decisions

13
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,190
made by Google to keep it free and open
and that makes it free to do stupid

14
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,310
things you really shouldn't be doing and
they happen a lot for example apps have

15
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,250
re-signed but they don't have to be
signed with a real public your typical

16
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,600
you can just sign most of what was the
point

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,680
I can even download somebody else's take
off their shoes or modified put on

18
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,440
myself right back on now if you leave
the original app on it'll say hey this

19
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
new app does not appear to be a proper
updated the previous on the singer's

20
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:18,400
first of all fixed them show up and show
official app store but they don't

21
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,910
actually keep out these other Layouts or
very well they've been humiliated with a

22
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,250
series of disasters so they're forced to
cheat a little tougher every time about

23
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,760
policing yet but you know I'm just
guessing you know sort of like a

24
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,640
religious issue was doing what they do
but it seems to me like that started

25
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,510
with open source says that you should be
able to do anything you want and they're

26
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,940
very reluctantly will be over to Apple's
position where you should be like a

27
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,010
child playing in a walled garden or your
parents keep all the bad people out

28
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,510
which is a whole lot cheaper of course
for most users the mig Android debug

29
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,579
bridge let you debugger device and send
data back and forth very nice and makes

30
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,510
it possible to push things onto the app
on the Android device pull files back

31
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:04,970
from it

32
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,410
observe the logs anything for the logs
must be published on the internet I mean

33
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,120
well I fractional jet relook at Beauty
available to every option available to

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,690
computers connected to the Vice show one
of the fundamental rule is never log

35
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,160
sensitive information you'll be hearing
more about that you can install things

36
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:33,740
you cannot execute commands which is
finer now Android app isn't apk file

37
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,960
which is just a container with a bunch
of files inside it and you can do static

38
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,930
analysis on it far easier than Windows
binaries Windows binaries when you

39
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,420
decompile may turn into a simple
language which is relatively difficult

40
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,410
to understand what their stuff turns
into smalley code and all you need is

41
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,440
this apk trouble free open source
product machines homework to play with

42
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,530
this strategy Trojan Android app so you
just run this thing and it does it's

43
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,380
magic and change this thing is just a
whole bunch of little objects and here's

44
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,310
judy Ameritrade a financial stock
broking stock trading at

45
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,010
it disassembled and I see all their
source code you might notice this is

46
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,140
really friendly but schumer API build
config account manager manager there's

47
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,050
nothing to stop me totally rear code all
the names of variables in such regions

48
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,250
Bank of America uses the standard
obfuscator called ProGuard which is

49
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,730
built into Android sweet Android
developer suite and completely useless

50
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:43,280
ProGuard is like a security guard locks
after doors negotiate as you can see all

51
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,099
these things are still readable ab&c an
ALS a whole bunch of just alone like

52
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,550
activities enrollment business credit
card details activity just sitting here

53
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:58,330
on the rest is like BRB SBT so it does
remove some of the names of the files

54
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,169
and change them but at least the
variable names readable so what's the

55
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,570
point of that and all the important
functions

56
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,780
original text lavatory name and you
might wonder how bad is this Molly

57
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,260
Cognos molly is

58
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:19,349
bytecode and so here's job and her two
small producers so if your name here put

59
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,810
password there turns into username
password it's really not a whole lot

60
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,540
harder to read than just a job it's a
little bit strange one thing you have to

61
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,670
get used to it you only have 16 local
variables and the local variables or

62
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,240
goldie in the perimeters are called p
and they come at the end and they count

63
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,550
against the total and some apps actually
used 32 of them but the second batch

64
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,650
cannot be used directly after key copied
unaware of the first 16 to use them but

65
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,429
you know ninety percent of the crime
everything you might want to do to take

66
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,590
over the air

67
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,859
understanding much of that I learned how
to go about three things it's Molly and

68
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,639
I

69
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,650
show then you do all you gotta do is
recompiled here apathy control you build

70
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,969
instead of taking it apart and then you
shine with yourself psyche and I can you

71
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:11,800
put it back on the phone so did you now
showing anything sensitive in the log so

72
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,120
you can monitor along with a green truly
Android device monitor and she things

73
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,779
appear in a log but the whole lot easier
to just do from command line with adb

74
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,219
logcat because then you can use drip
drip filter pension funds the ones you

75
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:28,729
like it so here I am looking for a
vehicle IRA or various this is actually

76
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,270
very interesting this is one of the very
few successes from work i'm talking bout

77
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,359
region one of the people actually patch
their app there are three or four of

78
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,259
them which surprised me because most of
the people are part of the stuff you

79
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,979
would not talk to me and the ones that
didn't talk to me to not passed yet but

80
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,900
over the last couple of days I said well
before you talk about the shoot anybody

81
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,960
wishing that if you did actually passed
their stuff without telling me anything

82
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,270
so I'm kinda pleased to see that they
are all just ignoring its like I thought

83
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:01,568
track by decompile disassemble you
ensure anything you want Trojan coli

84
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:07,949
keyloggers you can find out what
encryption method Richard I saw him at

85
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:13,689
bsides this showed us how the games with
this is actually pretty easy I don't do

86
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:22,330
anything hard nothing I do committee
harder than about 20 homers I'm so so

87
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,330
over the Bank of America

88
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:32,659
install an Android device then you use
these commands to get it back to the

89
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,539
device you can play with it this is the
shell command lists the packages on the

90
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,338
device and then I used to find the be of
a show it has a funny name calm in

91
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:41,180
Philadelphia

92
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:47,279
that I used to find out the exact passed
away apk file which is the single file

93
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,630
it includes the entire app and then I
just pull that filed down should know I

94
00:08:50,630 --> 00:09:00,970
have it on my computer now all you do is
use and what that creates is this whole

95
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:10,130
restructuring measures to bring it up
live here of course I read it all over

96
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:18,860
the last 24 hours to check for update
should be pretty fast because originally

97
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:27,290
focused on financial and here's the
latest one Bank of America 500 migrants

98
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,250
ten minutes in my hotel room so I
decided to only talk about this part of

99
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,010
it rather than trying to do it live show
you this is the apk file it comes down

100
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,880
when you just get the store has a few
XML file she can see you can control the

101
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,290
structure and a lot of files that are
going on up here but all the code is

102
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,750
this Molly directory and you can see
what they've done here being a coach and

103
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,209
custom code here from Android libraries
here in America orange involved in

104
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:59,479
various different people have
contributed to this code the huge

105
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,110
libraries and rolling here here's the
custom stuff they wrote e-commerce and

106
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,100
in particular willing to find the one
that's funded Trojan here just

107
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:16,339
journalists of life everything I'm sure
show you his website which is

108
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:22,309
wifi there goes the job down here all
the security results I'm going to

109
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:27,589
portray this is the landing page least
all the rest would go to load slow I'm

110
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:33,220
gonna look on my slider got it see you
can shoot for this stuff with Greg I

111
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,569
usually look for password if that
doesn't work I look for user agent your

112
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:40,550
idea a few other things and that doesn't
work at the start wondering if you get

113
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,359
routine looking at things and when
everything fails I wrote a triangle

114
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,970
python script about 10 lines along the
Trojans every module in the hole at

115
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:56,029
short runs slow and the Wardrobe dreams
and every single routine load puts a

116
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:02,199
little of everything runs and then
against the login screen after login see

117
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,969
what Roger that point to try to find
what part is likely to have the

118
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,430
credentials anyway this one here
smelling combi of AECOM author charities

119
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,019
enrollments

120
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,319
I think I'll just stick to the slide
ruslan saying she got in 2012 file

121
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,349
business credit card details activity
that's the one I found that handle

122
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,350
credit card under Steele

123
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:28,110
when you look at the code and this is
what it looks like now this is the

124
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,459
glorious other skater function is now
named else that whatever its original

125
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:38,300
name was but the string still called be
a part of me but this year is still

126
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,849
called set card number that I thought so
this is all the small Leone know how to

127
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,300
write

128
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,189
slightly more this but not much change
the number of local variables so I have

129
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:53,740
another one to work so before it was 30
V wanted V two variables you can use in

130
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,230
this region and i dont wanna step on one
of those changes on a break

131
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,699
changed it to five so now I can use
these for with impunity and that held up

132
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,170
not using 33 and here's the main project
I always use only thing I figured out

133
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,759
how to do I forget why maybe I copied
some bloggers are you can make a

134
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,740
constant string and you can put it into
law but this just makes a log this is

135
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:24,439
the name of the item NSW so I think this
thing in 30 is a strength and looks like

136
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:27,779
it has some of your card number so i
just want to see what it is like being a

137
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,370
Georgia card number right there

138
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,279
301 down here that just sets CVV

139
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,990
pretty good so I don't that one out and
actually the only thing I'm worried

140
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,949
about you when you see a function like
this to resolve those in the one on the

141
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:46,819
right anyway so I'm that's the game last
night you rebuild the thing with Java

142
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:52,209
jar and was also in keeping you just
can't change by the way

143
00:12:52,209 --> 00:13:03,888
ATK cool you should put it back together
for those who don't know what they're

144
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,500
all about I thought somebody actually
think something the first time that

145
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:06,920
happen

146
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,170
complains about everything seems to work
so let's play with these things it's

147
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:24,260
easy to see what it does look at the log
Wildcats will start with this one shows

148
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,779
you everything is going on that Android
device launched the Bank of America app

149
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:37,079
going by which is trying to charge
capping China still drunk cause this is

150
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,079
the Trojan

151
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:37,090
this is a common problem

152
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:17,020
enroll in banking that's what I want to
do get started with a small business

153
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:34,750
credit card charge my credit card number
the other social security number gets

154
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,120
dumped in a long because this is a
modified at this thing is communicating

155
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,570
with the Bank of America shares
cheerfully and dealing with it as it

156
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:48,580
goes by the Bank of America just don't
care it might be worth mentioning that I

157
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,470
told them about the show and got no
answer all these people announced in

158
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:59,190
February March and most of them don't
respond at all when you talk to him and

159
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,190
ones that do just trying to make
promises you don't come true

160
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,090
the Bancorp the doctors to show you
different categories intrusions that I

161
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,990
made those that were interesting Bancorp
is neither she case in Bancorp the usual

162
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,660
thing called the security alarm module
which meant to this kind of Trojan

163
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,290
wouldn't work they don't actually load
the password in a single variable that I

164
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,659
could fight but I can catch the
keystrokes 1234

165
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,739
so much that will do really

166
00:18:31,740 --> 00:19:00,530
Point Capital One Capital One world that
is developed and it captures the

167
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:06,070
keystrokes here I had destroyed
everything and then I noticed the same

168
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:23,419
thing every time I saw that ok gonna be
flapjack and the password is password ok

169
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:30,630
you get those key numbers are not a ski
they are some nonsense Google made up

170
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,240
and they put them on a page so i cant
find where they have like 10 per page

171
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,930
for 255 you have to scroll down to put
them back together but anyway it is

172
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,360
possible to turn those ridiculous things
back into letters like this 29 30 31 and

173
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,959
so on the password is included in that
nonsense just in a slightly irritating

174
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,220
manner so it does sort of proved the
point of course you know any code and

175
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,800
then recompile it ran that would be
enough in principle to prove that the

176
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,139
developers made a serious error they
should have led their code but my entire

177
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,380
contribution to this business theater

178
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,940
the point is you impress people and they
all care if you have some theoretical

179
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,280
problem they want to see you really
stolen credit card number they can

180
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,520
understand that's why I will try to make
really get something real so some trust

181
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,150
I was not going to just don't trust I
was working on the top 10 banks but I

182
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:32,580
put some of the information on Twitter
us just a SunTrust customer but

183
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,929
everybody ought to be both important so
let's take a look at SunTrust and

184
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,030
they're friendly judy's had responded by
reported to them and their should talk

185
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,980
to media should only other portable
really fix that but we're not sure when

186
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:55,380
that happened yet but he said it's not
under current active attack which is in

187
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,660
2011 maybe they have things down anyway

188
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:10,050
SunTrust unusual ideas user user
passwords later 11 again and here is

189
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:16,810
what SunTrust gives me all over the
place when I handed you was Trojan all

190
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:24,639
the use of the premises being set up the
network layer one hears the name and

191
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,700
password and user idea what I did here
was chosen the routine creates HTTP

192
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,700
requests and change parameters that's
why there's all this other job this is

193
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,800
the value and name of GDP perimeter
being said I but it could not capture

194
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:48,000
the only thing is that many developers
include many regimes they don't you sure

195
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,040
you find $100

196
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,840
all the wrestler like she called they
brought in the valujet anyway so that's

197
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:03,830
the game they're so drinking drinking is
when I found out yesterday actually so

198
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:12,220
let's go back just plain old logcat
everything happening on this device I go

199
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,850
back here

200
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:21,379
trade can just kind of stopped rolling
stock market trading activity crash this

201
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,510
one actually mean it when it crashed
this is the Trojan death and it won't

202
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:33,040
launch anymore and if you want to know
why you can see right analog right here

203
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,640
runtime exception just do it again

204
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,550
fatal exception their fatal exception
Thomas Dekker mobile Activity Log In log

205
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:52,159
in and up here we're going to see
verifier rejected clash login login and

206
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,410
that's why I put the Trojans so what
these Dec Jackley what these guys have

207
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,250
done now is they put in some code
notices that this module has been

208
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:08,130
altered and refuses to start and that is
exactly what I told him to do it just

209
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,530
seems to me the whole thing now I don't
know how they did it

210
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,350
comment about this year ago I wouldn't
be surprised if the

211
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,220
progress because that's all security
ever going to mean heart that's all you

212
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,670
can never do that will slow down people
are probably more perfect solutions but

213
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,350
at least they did something which I
appreciate my general summary page up

214
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,879
here we go

215
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:50,270
so this is the first time doing here is
talking about these things you just

216
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,170
believe police have not been patched
this 1 a.m. chant lack of protection or

217
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,790
you can modify the code so that's the
first we'll look into here because

218
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,159
basically every effort has to be
something like eight of the top 10 banks

219
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,500
nine of the top 10 stockbrokers seven
out of the top insurance companies all

220
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,920
have a strong show you something like
eighty or ninety percent of all apps or

221
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,440
bowling alley earlier the Bank of
America Corp Capital One chase the ones

222
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,360
being green

223
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,899
actually fixed and she and Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo probably because of my

224
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:28,540
students is like close to the head of
security there will be some trust

225
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:35,190
promise to pick just one thing it was
kind of entertaining was Charles Schwab

226
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,820
is vulnerable ish and tried to contact
them in turn into a real sure about the

227
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,649
way we mentioned here which i think is a
really bad idea is absolutely none of

228
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,220
these people have anybody million
reporting process far from bug bounties

229
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,200
or anything

230
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,110
there's not even any address to send the
things you sent your company not common

231
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,419
just bounces with a very few exceptions
so they're so far back in the dark ages

232
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,690
there pretending that they have no
problems in which is unlikely to be

233
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,830
anyway

234
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,409
options but in a charles schwab is
notably not lose exceptions

235
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,790
approaching the Charles Schwab and then
I tried to tell them they have a email

236
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:20,139
form which is just broken mirror
Christensen Email Security but that just

237
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,050
now she's of course I found another
email format

238
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:31,050
UK office which doesn't work either so
that I sent to the International Office

239
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,820
Schwab and I was able to send email

240
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,950
pounds but then I found a website the
chest the whole team lead roles rather

241
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,770
ignore everything comes in every email
address you just totally waste your time

242
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,560
so I switch to something which I have
done several times with great success

243
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:51,200
which as you look at the CEO on Twitter
and then you treated please problem I

244
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,120
have actually never failed with this
approach I don't like it because it's

245
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,729
tantamount to full disclosure on public
moment because I'm not willing to bother

246
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,870
she owes over nothing to create
background noise if I average reader

247
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:09,860
she'll anybody can guess exactly what I
have to say and that's of course what

248
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,709
happened

249
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:17,240
Swift on security of course figured out
how to say no so this is like

250
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,440
operational security you know

251
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:36,490
when I never had a way and this is a
fundamental problem we'll never fiction

252
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:44,670
I have one counter example coming up
later anyway so we contacted me and he

253
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,690
put me through the security team and
they sent me to the right person and he

254
00:26:48,690 --> 00:27:09,110
said oh for God's so anyway all these
trading after vulnerable and

255
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,260
however is one of the few that did
pictures and here's the others are going

256
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,830
to make those she only three people
actually fixed a nap now you'll never

257
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,699
stand here and insurance companies

258
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,060
Geico and Intuit TurboTax get yellow
because they didn't fix anything but

259
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,129
they do have a page report problems like
oh has a very nice pages are you a

260
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,120
security researcher lift as you
understand what we are but then I shall

261
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,219
make normally do nothing and one of them
I think it was actually promised that he

262
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,450
would have it out in the may update but
then they just did and I talked to the

263
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,360
security guy again over he told me they
were going to obviously the codon

264
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,800
you know it's not hard to test
everything I know electronic book to do

265
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,419
it for homework I mean I didn't get rude
discussing with them but you know

266
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,010
employee to do something you don't have
to test to see if they did it anyway

267
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:13,780
back to hear more categories of trouble
to talk about one defense that a lot of

268
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,620
people told me if this doesn't even
matter Trojan don't really ever gonna

269
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,399
happen you're just making it up it's not
a realistic threaten I don't think so

270
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:28,090
because you might reasonably say she if
this was an iPhone none of this would

271
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,459
happen because you have to install
things from the store and Apple actually

272
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,290
polices the store if you put a provision
happen the story you kick out just as

273
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:39,659
Charlie Miller and they're not messing
around and just doesn't do much that

274
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,600
they don't clean the story well and
people install stuff that's not from the

275
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,199
store but if everyone was just talking
to the store then Google could control

276
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,540
this but they're not very interested in
doing another did the Droid dream was to

277
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,060
be a Trojan 2 2011 but their application
verification services just fantastically

278
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,000
an effective this is effective as
compared to all the other any viruses or

279
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,150
just the bouncer thing is just not very
successful

280
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,790
anyway you can protect yourself here one
thing you can do is obviously your codes

281
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,060
which very hard to read and find where
to put the Trojan that helps all is not

282
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,419
a very strong defense they're also
products you can buy that will block

283
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:22,820
reverse engineering make a pkg will not
work can get pretty expensive the and by

284
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:28,830
the way Jason actually works this is
what you have now and this is what all

285
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,860
the variable names of turned into this
garbage fee that would irritate me I

286
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,689
might not get in should not write this
talk about had the lead role like

287
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,320
garbage volatile

288
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,860
such a reasonable obfuscator and two
thousand bucks and another protocol Park

289
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,600
San which one would talk to me cause I'm
not gonna buy it now must be even more

290
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,250
expensive and they claim it has multiple
layers of validation and verification

291
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,690
checks so you can't do you compile lists
up at all

292
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,590
recognizes already compiling jewels
breaks them all and I imagine it's

293
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,590
probably true they won't give you a free
samples tested but you can totally buy

294
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,790
products to prevent this and I'm
wondering how these people to in

295
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,940
business since nobody seems to care

296
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,840
but apparently some of them actually
patches so it seems to me that there's a

297
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,689
slow awakening that is actually problem
here anyway so actually as far as the

298
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:22,450
last one lakh a binary protections
should then I started noticing a look at

299
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:26,810
one of the most important work from
shirt in 2014 surged actually built a

300
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:31,330
special gadget called the tapioca I
think using a Raspberry Pi or something

301
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,870
it was a girl like a wifi pineapple with
them in the middle attack that would

302
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,189
then put a whole bunch of invalid
searched every website you went to sleep

303
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,960
could see if any of the Android apps
would accept intelligent hypocrites and

304
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,730
had all kinds of errors expired wrong
hostname and LGA and so on and they

305
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:55,010
found 23,000 vulnerable apps and they
notified all the app designers seven

306
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:00,260
months ago and they published the entire
listed on the internet so I was looking

307
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,010
at this thing she was interesting I
wonder how many people actually patch

308
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:10,120
their stuff so I started looking through
the page here and they're starting to

309
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,689
get me in trouble so this is why I said
to myself as I do not need to do

310
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,130
responsible disclosure shirt already did
responsible disclosure seven months ago

311
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,640
if they don't listen to surge they're
not gonna wish to be so these guys are

312
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,640
fair game that was Lampasas so your
pictures are actual financial stuff we

313
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,230
like daily downloads led the spreadsheet
to 23,000 things to chest person

314
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,560
actually testing 12 had the most
downloads because he looked important

315
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:41,990
like OkCupid safely in charge and these
are susceptible SSL man-in-the-middle

316
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,760
attacks and then we'll get down to the
one that showed stream actually think it

317
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,790
was possible PDF reader cuz I got
embarrassed to show you how this works

318
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,720
this one is slightly more complicated
very much more complicated because I'll

319
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:05,540
do anything so you have to use a proxy
war because I'm using a different wifi

320
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,540
which one of my dresses

321
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:25,250
ok 161 131 ok everything's through 168
11 31 in port 8080 and I'm running group

322
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:33,780
here is listening on all addresses
including that one 131 show I have a man

323
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,559
in the middle now if you wanna used
correctly you have to install reports

324
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,918
leader richard jacket in your device
should we trust it and if you don't if

325
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,820
you don't know what you're doing and
Stalberg incorrectly and you get these

326
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,428
warnings every time you try to browse to
secure site but that's what I want so

327
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:54,220
now I have put them in the middle attack
that does not have a LG a showed no

328
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,860
secure connections can be made from this
device right now so if any of these apps

329
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:06,820
make secure connections their life and
of course they do so here's the history

330
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,970
attempting to connect Asia GBS resources
and these aren't getting anywhere

331
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:15,760
couldn't get through what's clear the
old stuff and play some games here she

332
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,799
we did some trust in TradeKing here's
pic charged I don't know what they do

333
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:27,059
whatever is needed it badly HTTPS
connections here she should be post

334
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:31,049
connections going through sharing some
data but my device so they're making

335
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:35,299
these HTTPS connections now the port 443
is open and you can make the connection

336
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:41,840
but there is no good and the obviously
just don't even check it so I can find a

337
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:49,980
login button someplace where login again
putting layer one fool and I trust you

338
00:33:49,980 --> 00:34:06,010
here and sign in and it'll be right down
here someplace where we are I trust you

339
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,870
later wonderful you know show

340
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,690
they check it appears as using what they
think is HTTPS but they just commented

341
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,929
operation UBS validation probably just
so they could test it they just never

342
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,080
put it back in i mean i dont to another
developer I don't know exactly what

343
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,668
leads to this traditional think a lot of
them do and you know I'm surprised that

344
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:26,620
Google doesn't block you from the store
for stuff like this I think Apple would

345
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,370
I mean they could just run a test that
could be in Belcher maybe I'm just

346
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,918
underestimate the difficulties but he
seems to me like they could be about you

347
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:40,239
if you have a good kick you out of the
store and you know what kind of fun here

348
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,699
suppose you're traveling with one of
these public service ads she Google+ I

349
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,040
can't get in and that's because picture
art is not as stupid as they could be

350
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,918
when you click on these external links
they appear to be launching an external

351
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,980
browser which is probably the default
browser and see the default browser is

352
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,870
smart enough not to let this happen
we're going to see that is not always

353
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,920
the case anyways I'm able to steal
picture credentials that I got Institute

354
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:17,440
which is something related to Instagram
whatever that is I just market and here

355
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:28,030
they are money to login show I'm chest
user later one Password one login don't

356
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,660
bother remembering that wouldn't be
secure and there it is just you 2011

357
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,720
stole my time in the military so they're
just throwing the password on the ground

358
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,180
like they don't care who hears OkCupid
and she OkCupid used to be vulnerable

359
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,740
and they patched it is one of the
services actually paid attention so I

360
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:57,339
appreciate that they no word so I
haven't tried now and I'll try to shape

361
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:08,850
up my car to get to the personalized
section where you sign in a safe way

362
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,410
user com

363
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:24,990
my dog's name and there goes that stuff
all over the world and then it went to

364
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,990
serving the Sherman Oaks that's no good
which is evil

365
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,510
it should have told me you know they
can't get there from here because

366
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,359
something's wrong with your network
connection so there's the game there

367
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:39,220
Pixar is 200 million each OkCupid
actually fixed it simply told me

368
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,270
1,000,000 but you know there are a lot
of like more than a dozen on that list

369
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:47,770
there that I tested and show them that
was pretty entertaining I said well you

370
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,599
know the only thing occurred to me is
you can check the spreadsheet that came

371
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,190
from a search you can sort them by
category and there's a category called

372
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,230
medical and he seems to me like some of
those guys might be covered by hip and

373
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,849
I've had pretty good luck in the past to
getting attention by violations

374
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:06,760
especially if you go right to the Fitch
which I haven't done with these yet but

375
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,630
I have gotten far enough to get some
attention so I just took the same

376
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,619
another reason why anybody ever cared
about this is because Dan Goodin at the

377
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,619
technical wrote this stuff up

378
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:23,060
show there's actually an arch technical
articles about this one which had the

379
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,170
first part of these things we talked
about the fact that these crimes haven't

380
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:30,290
patched their thing even seven months
after being told by surprising to me is

381
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,940
that some staff secure was a security
product which we had this problem and

382
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,890
they did fact picture pretty quickly
cause I'm pretty sure bill using and the

383
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:44,049
folks at Mobile PDF reader had social
networking options because this is

384
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,589
pretty fun there were two or three
things that this kind of stuff you if

385
00:37:47,589 --> 00:38:09,600
you're determined you can call other ppl
services chip so ok

386
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,730
so far more PDF reader I can harvest

387
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:21,020
credentials here but then Fox it can
connect to cloud readers and here we are

388
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:30,450
open a local copy this page since the
internet doesn't work remember where I

389
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:39,049
find it was this one this one there we
go I should be able to run local copies

390
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:52,230
of all these things there are now 10 K

391
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:58,410
reader million downloads and she fucks
it can connect all these services to get

392
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:03,009
the PDFs you want to reach and when you
do that it's just not going to launch

393
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,030
the default browser like it should

394
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,850
are used to system routines it uses
their custom junk they wrote that

395
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:13,509
doesn't work so this looks like a
browser but they wrote some version of a

396
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:19,520
browser that ignores church if package
so I can steal your Dropbox password and

397
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,550
your box password and your Microsoft
past as you connect to the Microsoft

398
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:29,500
cloud and so on the exposure all these
other passwords used by connecting

399
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,190
future on each occur custom code show
when I put that on Twitter and they

400
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:42,790
actually passed that one pretty fast
anyway let me go back to my list here so

401
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,840
the medical apps the next thing they
want to look at it as it seemed to me

402
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,720
like you guys violate HIPAA now I'm not
a lawyer but looked at hit shows you are

403
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,720
supposed to ensure confidentiality
integrity and availability of medical

404
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,060
information if you are a covered
provider industry categories uncovered

405
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,020
providers but pharmacies are included
and so are doctors so there's something

406
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,700
here called gene EMG and this thing

407
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:16,410
product you use to manage your health
and your medications your vitamins into

408
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,759
this thing

409
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,300
shining using email and I can steal the
credentials

410
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,980
and what jeanne and he claims is that
the patient is not a covered entity the

411
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,820
patient is allowed to you something
insecure to store their stuff and

412
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,460
therefore this is not a violation of
HIPAA and I looked at the third category

413
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,020
covered entities and I thought maybe
they included but I don't really know

414
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,310
but I said you know what your break SSL
anyway but I got no answer beyond that

415
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:47,279
distinguish our lawyers answer to their
ideological going shut up anyway but the

416
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,280
other one was entertaining was back to
my slides here

417
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,839
noticed this one called lowest bid now
this is the spreadsheet from church from

418
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,900
seven months ago

419
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,730
here's the medical category and a summer
cold lowest mid corporate so I went

420
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:08,050
looked at lowest midcourt richard hirsch
GMD it has lost mid corporate now jeanne

421
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,320
indeed responded immediately when I put
this on Twitter we are told by HIPAA

422
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,520
Security go away

423
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:22,100
well that's an interesting position to
take lost med contacted the college I

424
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,080
sent them an email telling me about it
and they ignored that and called the

425
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,779
president of the college and demanded
that I can assure the college

426
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,990
orientation and then I should pass the
information on to me and I replied in

427
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,589
writing saying why don't you put
whatever you have to shake in writing on

428
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,860
the phone and then I'll run it past my
lawyer and we will take an appropriate

429
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:48,230
response and suddenly they got polite
and said well you don't we think we're

430
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,100
probably not covered by it though
because there's nothing personal in our

431
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:55,390
product and that might be true but take
a look at these guys she account just

432
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:59,970
these guys to thoroughly because without
a valid credentials I can't see exactly

433
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:07,089
what they do once you get inside but
let's move this thing and go here

434
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:14,029
his lowest mad this is a corporate
products that is used to buy medicines

435
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:22,130
and you're here we are using and
password my username is just user and

436
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:33,430
chest and there it goes tanning tests
user just be a sort of injury early so I

437
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:39,460
do not know what's behind this i assume
the list of Medicine you're buying and I

438
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,920
think there is a sort of disingenuous
issue here about how I've only still in

439
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,249
the password that stop P that's not
medical information I see what's behind

440
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:51,379
that word but anyway I do understand the
whole point of lawyers just lay here

441
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,119
anyway

442
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,460
genealogy which is more the same really
oMG is a product you use you keep track

443
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,299
of your symptoms and so on there
something called my Genie AMD which i

444
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:08,288
think you can use to order medications
would make it covered by HIPAA but maybe

445
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:09,230
not

446
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:17,460
and anyway to login looks like yeah you
already have an account please delete my

447
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,989
old data I tested it earlier and I have
to clean it after each test for this one

448
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:38,058
GMD cleared it ok and now here's gene
EMT stuff now when I go to my GMD

449
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:45,680
just sign up and shut up this way in
terms of use which by the way I don't

450
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,089
need to see the region which is
entertaining picture user ok well we're

451
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:53,339
fine

452
00:43:53,339 --> 00:44:00,960
sign up and of course that is available
to be stolen on the internet and then

453
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,210
it's gonna ask me this stuff blood type
gender are you pregnant zip code you

454
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:11,589
know this is PRI but anyway they're
going to argue with a tougher crime and

455
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:16,078
I don't know they may slide on hip but
I'm hoping there are some motivation to

456
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,099
actually fix their junk anyway so
excited you know I thought shirt caught

457
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,529
them all with their automated process
but then I just tested some random apps

458
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:28,339
and they were vulnerable so I don't know
how certain system where they added you

459
00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:31,910
vulnerable in the last seven months it
might be the answer but I started crying

460
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,009
a lot of apps new ones I found a lot of
a border policeman middle attack and I

461
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,460
contacted him saying I think they're
violating HIPAA and one of them really

462
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,369
takes the cake for Blue Cross Blue
Shield of North Carolina and the reason

463
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:46,150
I can talk about it because these guys
had the worst illegally but they're the

464
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:50,809
fastest affection so you picked up
within two days which was yesterday I

465
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:53,269
was able to actually talk about it now
the rest of the stuff I have to wait

466
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:56,430
another month before you talk about what
they have to actually connect mobile

467
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,930
instantly connect mobile and those
things

468
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:05,529
Facebook Twitter and YouTube critical
supply not verify the Jetta good I told

469
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:08,940
them and they fix it in two days and now
should you try just says the connection

470
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:14,049
is not secure they're really very nice
so the developer is really a hero

471
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:19,469
responding quickly to a real and lasting
just right got 10 minutes not sure one

472
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,599
thing at the end I thought you to kick
out of I was trying to do insurance

473
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:27,180
companies and insurance company called
AIG did not have a nap but they had some

474
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,339
weird angle DIGE Mobile guard showed you
buy their insurance you want to protect

475
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:35,779
your phone itself after install the
security product on your phone to

476
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:40,460
protect it which I guess let me remote
wipe the road found and that product is

477
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,059
fantastic you I was your little all been
talking about you when I Trojan a nap I

478
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:49,450
put the password in the log because
that's so ridiculous that proves that

479
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,058
I'm able to destroy the app so I wrote a
Trojan for this one but the password to

480
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:56,059
log and then I looked already look

481
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:06,020
so it all anyway dude you know I have
this special a person to be insecure

482
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,680
that I should do for homework

483
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:14,140
dude I could just use your app like the
example that comes pre Trojans and so I

484
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,348
contacted them and also has local
storage of all your data is stored your

485
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:23,780
security question you should answer
European in plain text on the device so

486
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:31,530
anyway there were four versions of this
thing and 341 going to have enough time

487
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,770
to demonstrate this one let me take a
moment to make it quick going through

488
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:42,589
the proxy cuz it makes the reasons we're
done with that part here's mobile rescue

489
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:46,020
let me delete the data from a rescue

490
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:54,369
only get to put indeed with your first
got to do is get rid of the proxy which

491
00:46:54,369 --> 00:47:04,180
is occasion I'm just connecting directly
to the internet now let's get the log

492
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:09,649
going by which looks like it is going
right and I think the thing to search

493
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:18,500
for for this one to avoid getting a lot
of junk is in code ok and code ok so now

494
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:23,750
you start this security product protects
your phone mobile rescue I've agreed to

495
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,460
this whatever it is activating the
product

496
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:47,439
they meet up in what if I change the pin
to something real secure like that name

497
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:00,970
there we go up in 1337 in case you
didn't get it there it is again and now

498
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:05,020
I'm gonna putting more stuff and that's
pretty interchange I contacted them and

499
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:10,370
they said that they perished and it just
like they said it was your old

500
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:17,020
production of new products to the better
but I kind of doubt anyway I got

501
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,310
anything else you i think thats all I
want to show you those things all

502
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,310
feeling yeah so you got any questions

503
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:25,419
solutions code but I don't think

504
00:49:31,780 --> 00:50:15,050
I would like to know what they might not
be verified the name on the shirt I

505
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:20,330
would not catch that but but still I
just used these things and what it

506
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:24,240
appears to me just a lot of a comment
about all delegation tired I just left

507
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,240
it that way because you can use it for
years the customers will not others

508
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:40,460
quite a few I cannot just in this manner
because they do bypass the proxy HTTPS

509
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:46,230
out so that's another reason why the
test because they put a real device in

510
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,860
the middle so they have no chance to go
past it

511
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:57,190
test and its relatively sloppy but I
don't know if the case but you have

512
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,900
mentioned that using the default browser
could solve a lot of this I think injury

513
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:07,300
default browser doesn't do checks so if
you get your hands on a little search or

514
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,080
enter key still not in the middle with
an expired certificate in the Afghan

515
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:26,890
actually go out and check for that even
if uses default browser Google Chrome

516
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:39,569
browser that may have changed but I
think before they told me I did not know

517
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:53,380
that the start of every app provides a
number of local variables such a

518
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:58,540
standard thing that just says what the
name of the module is analog and
