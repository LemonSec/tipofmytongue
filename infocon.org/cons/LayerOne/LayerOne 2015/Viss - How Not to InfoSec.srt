1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:15,960
welcome to the next talk if you think
this guy socks and 100 bottles personal

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,770
this is my entry will be doing this out
of the pool area for till we get bored

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,279
of it the coming of Nexus dan Taylor
with how not to impose sexy big round of

4
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:39,250
applause on my talk is actually entirely
full of fail so this is for fun while we

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,800
were setting up this is an ongoing piece
of research which I might actually talk

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,390
about this is anybody heard the stories
recently but that sign in Atlanta

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,510
Georgia that goateed these are other
signs in the country that are still

8
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:05,459
vulnerable to the same attack and just
for fun and how to meet right so I guess

9
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,259
today we talking entirely but mistakes
which is something I i've seen very very

10
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,030
rarely in InfoSec in its entirety
Wednesday night made Wednesday

11
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,390
co-workers have made once a clients have
made employers the company in the public

12
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,790
stuff that are seen on Twitter and in
the media you name it just like this

13
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,670
giant flaming failed talk all talking
about mistakes that are entirely

14
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,490
preventable and could have been
prevented with no effort basically so

15
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,908
this is about this story about me slide
you people if you want to stop me on the

16
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,950
air that's how this is an important part
of the important part is that when faces

17
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,880
problems and everyone knows how to deal
with them several years ago for me but

18
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,329
it went to DEFCON you may remember that
Adam Savage actually took the stage and

19
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:53,979
he presented specifically on the topic
of how failure made him the manual and

20
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,030
how failing fast and learning what not
to do next time with Intermountain

21
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:09,869
jail mike is fail anyway yeah so so
taking his philosophy degree I am

22
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,869
searching

23
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:52,390
heart talk to basically articulate sort
of gift then conditionals for security

24
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,290
problems where the van is your company
will end up in the news or gets hacked

25
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,250
to oblivion or goes out of business or
have you are male strains and upon taste

26
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,130
in so the goal here is effectively to
help every effort to help out the crowd

27
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,769
by process of elimination so if I can
show you what not to do it'll help

28
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,360
narrow down what you should do so
instead of telling you what to do or

29
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,080
what school also know I stepped over
here on a land mine and blew up my legs

30
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,170
don't be me so this is actually really
need this is a tumbleweed minesweeper

31
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,679
that guy in Kabul built it's made out of
bamboo and like these little things and

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,610
invented and it's carried by the wind so
he's let it loose in the deserts of

33
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,870
Kabul and it runs over land mines and
takes out my mind is really cool because

34
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,590
it helps keep things like kids walking
over to land mines and pets and other

35
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,120
people or have you like it's a
minesweeper and it's entirely automated

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,959
you just let it go into this is pretty
cool I thought that was pretty

37
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,959
inspirational and I thought that was
very

38
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,790
parallel to the talk show in my in my
security experience i've i've had

39
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,390
experienced quite a lot so my intention
here is to basically show you where I

40
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,579
stepped on these mines and how my legs
got blown off and all the colorful fun

41
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,700
backs of my legs whereas others do the
same where saw you know creators and

42
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,910
other little flags are left by other
people were mines were and effectively

43
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,029
this is sort of the world on the same
team in the room we all have the same

44
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:20,820
goal that's all Internet together and
the first really fun talking point at

45
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,330
all I mention is that there's a lot of
people that have come from the military

46
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,169
and that believe that because they are
rumored Robert Reichert in something in

47
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,590
the military had absolutely nothing to
do with computers that they have like a

48
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,799
golden ticket to work in information
security and yeah so I want to start

49
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,110
with like a hypothetical story so let's
say that you have an FBI team manager

50
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,640
sheriff I T manager of Fortune 500 I T
manager a startup DevOps Guyana

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,810
Pentastar all walk into a bar together
and they sit down and start talking

52
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,760
everyone works for an organization that
runs Windows stack right Active

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,479
Directory exchange I S you name it so
the pen tester says hey did you guys

54
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,460
hear about Ms 1500 34 that new I asked
denial of service vulnerability that

55
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,609
came out like two months ago the DevOps
guy says yeah we have combined are

56
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,840
running on top of Long Tan Sri kata
we're watching me get dropped by idiots

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,810
in China that are attacking us and our
tools are all adding it to a firewall

58
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,930
rules and it's really amazing it's all
three you guys should check this out its

59
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,020
book its built-in security and and you
know you know props too late for helping

60
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,700
us out with that the FBI agent folds
arms and says the sheriff nervously

61
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,090
folds his arms look at the FBI guys'
what he said the Fortune 500 I T manager

62
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,030
says oh man law enforcement looks all
twitchy and nervous I better not say

63
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,119
anything without talking to counsel
independence is fucking all of you guys

64
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,890
have sent an email in the last week and
your mail headers tell me you're running

65
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,039
Exchange like this shit isn't a secret
why you making it a secret

66
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,490
like you know in meanwhile the SCA in
the GOP are looting everyone in stealing

67
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,900
shit male schools are showing up on
paceman while you have one guy in the

68
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,299
room saying we should all work together
and everyone else in the room saying no

69
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,419
that's classified so that's contributing
to the problem so hiding mistakes

70
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,859
because they might make you look bad
when the prices over at massive

71
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,970
compromise your generally gonna have a
bad time so classifying things a secret

72
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,410
only to claim that you have secrets
doesn't make you look cool it hurts you

73
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,870
and makes you look desperate for
attention so we're all the same side so

74
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,770
let's take that into consideration as we
roll into the stalker so we thought we'd

75
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:31,750
large ridiculous public fails you might
recognize a lot of logos on this slide

76
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,940
and so these things are effectively
large how not to enforce a sort of

77
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,270
posters for everyone to follow right
solicit this list of companies are

78
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,940
getting bigger and every year it gets
bigger and bigger in the last five years

79
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,659
we've seen effectively more than
doubling of massive public breaches

80
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,909
year-over-year and the overwhelming
majority of these were preventable

81
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:56,469
everything from preventing very simple
single injection to looking along files

82
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,240
to storing data in not plain text

83
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,889
having competent staff is usually a
really good one even including doing

84
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,810
intrusion detection and monitoring
traffic like a base 101 level so this is

85
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,699
a fancy graphics that I didn't make in
this is just from April 2015 back to

86
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,130
2013 so this is two years of data and
this is like millions of customer

87
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,310
records that were owned because of
simple stuff and this is only the people

88
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,110
that chose to disclose and this was only
the things that affected customer

89
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,150
records of your credit card or something
like that right so clearly what we've

90
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,270
been doing now

91
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,159
hasn't really been working at that have
not been as effective as it could be and

92
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,080
obviously the definition of insanity is
doing the same thing over and over again

93
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,219
and expecting a different result so
should consider doing something

94
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:46,919
different we're getting better but we're
still hampered by various wet blankets

95
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,859
the following is a compendium of
specific examples of when doing

96
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:57,990
something specific examples was
something that was done

97
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,219
effective security in a very negative
and dramatic way these examples will be

98
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,790
from a variety of perspectives

99
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,200
the pen tester the atty Dept networking
team the vendors and things like that so

100
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,210
the goal here is not to the goal here is
effectively to describe what not to do

101
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,729
in any given scenario so we'll start
with massive engineering fails lack of

102
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,940
foresight deliberate misconduct
charlatans his employer's reasons

103
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,250
outside of security why security wasn't
a consideration and there's a lot so

104
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,520
sadly I can't afford to issue everyone
in the room helmets I really hope you

105
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,960
brought your own so first we'll start
with deliberate SSL man in the middle if

106
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,890
your organization decides to man in the
middle

107
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,840
SSL connections and the argument is that
it's for advertising marketing or

108
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,150
collecting user data as a security
person in the room effectively it's your

109
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,340
job to tell these guys this is a really
bad idea we should consider not doing it

110
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,270
some of you may remember an incident
when a company called superfish recently

111
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,500
basically installed or less malware on
every Lenovo laptop that they were

112
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,150
shipping their excuse was effectively
that they wanted to do what Google is

113
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,430
doing and USL man in the middle to
capture the things that people are

114
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,739
searching for the text that people

115
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,300
worshiping back and forth to the
internet for whatever reason so that

116
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,000
they could be targeted for they could be
targeted for advertising purposes so

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,550
superficial didn't take into account
what would happen if bad guys actually

118
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,719
found their cert and the bad guys did
find their search and the bad guys

119
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,209
misused their cert and they were more or
less shamed off of the internet publicly

120
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:37,119
so lesson number one don't invade
people's privacy for monetary gain stop

121
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,720
it you can if you can't stop it make it
clear what people are doing is bad news

122
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,339
in trying get it in writing

123
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,180
also don't be surprised if your tickets
hijacked and is used in a very evil way

124
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,819
because you didn't consider that you
were enabling attackers to do the same

125
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:56,480
people stuff you were doing for the
purposes of advertising for fun you know

126
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,670
we're not going to happen this weekend
here in the user's computer in addition

127
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,569
to the music right so while back and a
lot of you probably heard this one

128
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,350
already

129
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,170
Sony had the genius idea of installing
malicious code on audio CDs I would

130
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,140
install itself on the computer if people
were putting their audio CDs in the

131
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,240
computer to you know rip music I listen
to it or have you so it would phone home

132
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,709
intelligence on the user and it would
modify their computer to prevent it from

133
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,130
copying audio and other things like that
so again if you ever seen a meeting with

134
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,110
someone suggests we should install
software on your on the customers

135
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,950
computers for the sake of DRAM and copy
protection you're effectively if you're

136
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,100
the security person the room it's your
job to yelling shouting make a scene is

137
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,920
this is really fucking bad idea so as
the attorney would put it let's not do

138
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,339
anything that would get a sued so lesson
number two

139
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,540
straightforwardly just don't install
malware and our customers machines right

140
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,160
simple you think this was in Florida
right so you know when you have the

141
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,439
typical

142
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,980
jealous spouse mode where you know I
can't I can't feel safe and secure

143
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,220
unless I know everything anybody in the
room remember Carrier IQ karaoke was fun

144
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,120
so like watching your users type on to
their mobile devices is dropping their

145
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,070
keystrokes isn't really cool no matter
how you try and slice it awhile back a

146
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,330
company called Carrier IQ did this with
Android phones the same way the

147
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,850
superficial this with the Lobos they
installed software at the factory before

148
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,210
it was sold the phones are sold to
consumers and companies like Verizon and

149
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,820
AT&T ship these phones to consumers and
it was installed by default it turns out

150
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,570
later the Carrier IQ is funded by a
company that was known to be a CIA front

151
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,260
fork interesting research they also got
effectively shamed off of the internet

152
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,569
so listen to three simply don't log your
customers if they find out that your key

153
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,860
logging them you're gonna have a bad
time so I know another great point here

154
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,770
is if you're if you're if you're the
blue team person or if you're part of a

155
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,730
blue team in an organization might be an
idea to take into consideration people

156
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,970
leaving password files on their desktops
or in file shares with just like a text

157
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,880
file or Excel spreadsheet full of
passwords I can tell you from personal

158
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,210
experience that I love these as the bad
guy when I'm paid to do a pen tester

159
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,910
assessment and I lose somebody mailbox
right behind us find these uncertainties

160
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,730
desktop it is supremely helpful to me as
the bad guy so routinely folks at work

161
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,740
in offices right password on sticky
notes or are they putting on a white

162
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,490
board with reporting on file-sharing
they put him on

163
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,880
file shares or you know text files on
the Desktop PC five places so another

164
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,620
thing to consider here is that
effectively your inbox is also an easy

165
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,830
easy storage solution for this sort of
stuff and the main company file sharing

166
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,560
is because everyone has access to things
like that at least one employee has done

167
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,160
this at every single engagement ever
conducted and it's been super helpful in

168
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,120
every engagement ever done so in usually
it's been like the head of development

169
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,260
or like the second in command of I T
like somebody that should know better

170
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:59,450
and every single time it is it is one of
the huge leaps and bounds and I can make

171
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,360
it to go from barely having any access
to effectively owning the whole company

172
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,510
another really fun thing here is that
organizations that set like your typical

173
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,010
you should change this password like
welcome 123 year change me or what have

174
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,589
you

175
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:17,839
a lot of organizations will set a
password like that like Tuesday cash one

176
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,830
or Monday at five or something like that
and people will never change that

177
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,100
password when it comes time to change a
password like a 90 days 480 days were

178
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,270
over the past policy says if the change
passwords they just changed the number

179
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,339
on the end from five to six so really
easy to guess really easy perforce you

180
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,740
know or maybe this one case the specific
guy he's Microsoft OneNote and he had a

181
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,709
OneNote files full of all of his
credentials for all of his networking

182
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:47,739
equipment on the database servers all
the production gear everything in in 10

183
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:54,730
and he I guess you had like something he
he chose his zip up all of his one notes

184
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,700
into a zip file and then email them to
himself and I found them so I went from

185
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,079
one day from 10 cool official one guy
and have a shell in his box 200 now have

186
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,880
passwords to the entire infrastructure
like in one step

187
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,550
I went from like I now have access to
now own the whole shop so you know don't

188
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,160
don't presume that your email box is a
safe place to store clear text passwords

189
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:26,850
and exploit them and then I'll talk
right so lesson number four with Stephen

190
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,890
Colbert got it right

191
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,209
like gee passers like dick pics don't
leave them lying around for people to

192
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:31,839
find

193
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,510
presume people will go looking for them
and when they're found your gonna be

194
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,740
really embarrassed you're gonna have a
bad time so almost every company

195
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,560
averaging four as well as sony has been
in the news recently has had this

196
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,000
problem and it's something that people
talk about in the office but I heard so

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,650
much like in talks the notion of a file
share conundrum is basically you have

198
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,340
like four terabyte array and everyone in
the company has full read-write access

199
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:02,770
to this array and everyone reads writes
stuff like a char finance the board you

200
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,939
know the executives they all work in
this giant Open File Share and everyone

201
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,400
has read write access to everything else
so you have like desktop backups and and

202
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,350
people's a very bright of other backups
in people's personal stuff all lives in

203
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,450
the huge file share so you catch it
after hours and just run a search on it

204
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:27,700
you-name-it passwords passport photos
driver's license photos people's

205
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,780
personal stuff mortgage documentation
like stuff they shouldn't be work in the

206
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,230
first place so it's kind of a gold mine
there I found things like bank transfers

207
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,870
for half a million dollars and up with
signed like people signatures and the

208
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,750
names of everyone who's on the board I
found documentation for companies that

209
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,210
have sold or bought either component of
their business or bot whole other banks

210
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:55,570
and all that documentation was just on a
file share that anybody could read so if

211
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,250
if if you presume that the attackers are
at least as good as us it's gotta be

212
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,060
considered that this is probably one of
the first places they're gonna go look

213
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,699
so take that into consideration if you
have any leverage in your organization

214
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,840
over the people that keep track of what
goes on these mammoth file shares you

215
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,220
know if I'm the bad guy who gets hired
to attack your shop that's one of the

216
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,490
first places I wanna look so segmented
in some way probably be a good idea to

217
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,460
like rap your file shares and granular
British permissions of some kind at

218
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,070
least down to like the department to
level me look what happened to Sony

219
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,400
that's exactly what happened the
attackers got in I found this giant file

220
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,800
share with everything I just alluded to
this number five

221
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,490
wrap huge file shares with permissions
of some kind right so this is a really

222
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,830
fun one this is a big winner have seen a
bunch of places

223
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,439
network equipment that runs day today at
ninety percent CPU or 90% TCP session

224
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,610
saturation some of you might know what
that means in the crowd but for those

225
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,300
that don't let me explain some
networking gear has a low ceiling for

226
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,219
how many concurrent TCP sessions it can
handle and when that reaches its limit

227
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,230
it starts to drop

228
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,970
sessions that come in which means a sage
sessions Die video sessions died VoIP

229
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,530
calls drop in like the network starts
getting really flaky inserts misbehaving

230
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,720
and this makes people angry especially
if you're using voice because like

231
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:23,160
important drop down stuff stuff goes out
in a bad time so if you're in the

232
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,420
networking group in your knowingly
letting your gear run that hot you

233
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,760
should strongly consider resigning
especially if you're part of a billion

234
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,770
dollar publicly traded company you're
putting the entire organization at risk

235
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,090
on a daily basis I understand the
budgets can be tough but knowingly

236
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,189
letting your run

237
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,010
knowingly letting your hardware run that
hot is putting effectively the entire

238
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,890
organization at risk and if you're in
charge of security or in charge of

239
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,590
networking in that organization the last
place you want to be a satin for the

240
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,970
board explaining to the board

241
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,890
why you knowingly let the router that
connects your office to your datacenter

242
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,790
run in ninety percent CPU and you did
nothing about it and then it continues

243
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,810
to go down in the developers are having
trouble aboard an ass like why are we

244
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,610
letting you be in charge of our
networking gear if you don't give a shit

245
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:18,689
about it so the other fun things to do
here is if you're on the security side

246
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,580
of the house you'll hear from the
networking site of the house that you're

247
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,800
not allowed to scan that particular
piece of equipment you're not allowed to

248
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,659
scan that segment of the network because
you might bring something down what is

249
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,160
generally a gigantic indicator of luck
if you're fifty thousand $100,000

250
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:41,590
$200,000 firewall can't withstand me on
a laptop with nmap get out like I'll do

251
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,470
you not working

252
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,890
get out your an idiot sorry leaves like
lesson six if your firewall can't deal

253
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,260
with an apps can get a new firewall if
your network engineers try to defend a

254
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,029
position in

255
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:55,669
anyway by running gear at ninety percent
saturation and somehow they claim it's

256
00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:01,539
ok get you get your network engineers so
and then on the same sore on a slightly

257
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:05,590
different side of that coin the more
than just an organization that

258
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,168
deliberately runs its gear at ninety
percent CPU or 90% TCP session

259
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:14,369
saturation specifically so that they can
claim security can scan this which I've

260
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:17,889
encountered multiple times it's so
sensitive you can't stand it no we're

261
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,939
not allowed to do ought to this
equipment

262
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,580
monitored by security or nothing on the
other side of the link is it is allowed

263
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,949
to be accessed your skin because it
might hurt firewall you've experienced

264
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,389
this new organization then you're kind
of dire circumstances because as a

265
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:34,589
security professional in the room you're
literally at the mercy of a group of

266
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:38,379
people who have positioned themselves
between you and being successful at your

267
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:42,559
job so far in every case i've seen this
weird about it the people in charge of

268
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,089
the networking equipment are under
qualified or have no place touching

269
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:49,349
networking equipment to begin with it's
a precarious place to be in because

270
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:53,710
you're effectively you're successful in
your job is being limited by people who

271
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,049
look won't let you touch gear that
you're responsible for in terms of

272
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:03,259
security so you have to it's a really
bizarre place here and you have to deal

273
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:06,559
with in their social engineering the
group into letting you conduct scan

274
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,009
somehow or or to replace underpowered
equipment so it's just bizarre like

275
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,539
suddenly you can't just be security
engineers from now on I have to be a

276
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:17,789
politician you're up affect your
effectively up against people that are

277
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,158
like career politicians they will
fiercely defend themselves because their

278
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,820
goal is to hide the fact that they don't
know what they're doing and your

279
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,359
security scanning will illuminate the
fact that they don't know what they're

280
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,519
doing so they will fight tooth and nail
to keep you from doing your job because

281
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,950
it will prove that they're not doing
theirs so don't let you know lesson 7

282
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,389
don't let the dirt metastasize that
cancer grows deep it's nearly impossible

283
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:43,258
to get rid of dole it under qualified
people dictate how security works a tall

284
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:50,299
order I know but I have the burn scars
to talk to talk about it so cross

285
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,859
contamination is a fun one network
segmentation is really simple to tell a

286
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:58,629
very short story one last engagement I
did there was

287
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:05,220
or on the building that had itself veal
and a to the production equipment which

288
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,960
basically means all of the fun security
implementations all the policies that

289
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,650
were written all the rules that were
thrown down the governance department

290
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,580
had all this oversight their months and
months and months of planning to come to

291
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,780
create an environment where you can
safely get from the office to the

292
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,510
production equipment and some way was
entirely circumvented by the network

293
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,140
group because they decided that was too
much trouble and they were lazy so they

294
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,050
set up everybody on a particular floor
if you were on that floor you can get

295
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,409
directly to like production production
database servers production web server

296
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:39,970
so I popped up on shelves on that floor
like what do you do why you wasting time

297
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:46,960
with policies are going to circumvent
the right so it's it's on practically

298
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,870
every assessment of ever done there's
always been some sort of backdoor in

299
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,149
this regard there's always been some
sort of bizarre network segmentation

300
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,800
like they just didn't say anything cuz
nobody is there's no oversight typically

301
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,700
you know the security department or the
networking Department tend to be sort of

302
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,770
the top of the stack there there's
nobody cares nobody cross-checking the

303
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,129
work necessarily in this year

304
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,970
organs big enough to have multiple
networking departments or multiple

305
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,630
departments in most cases 11 so they'll
do it the gonna get away with it

306
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:18,490
nobody'll notice until some asshat like
me comes by and test and pointed out so

307
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,210
less than eight effectively don't trust
host on the land just because they're

308
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,690
all the land if a bad guy gets control
of that host then the bad guy has

309
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,810
control can potentially get control of
everything that the host can touch so if

310
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,960
you have bypasses on your land you're
probably gonna have a bad time so here's

311
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,150
a passer use let's let's let's beat a
dead horse let's let's beat a picture of

312
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:46,200
a dead horse to beat the guy beating the
pictures of dead horse pressure to use

313
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,590
is hilariously old topic that somehow
always keeps coming up with the

314
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,100
introduction of a tool like me gets past
three years really becomes a problem

315
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,800
because

316
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,909
instead of dealing with short password
you can have really complex passwords in

317
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,630
their 30 characters long before using
the same complex password on hosting a

318
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,620
as host B which is a different domain
but the passage of the same and I use

319
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,189
many cats to get pass for a I'm going to
use that password to try and get a nose

320
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,890
be so for those not familiar with me
that's basically what it does is it

321
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,930
explains a scenario within Windows that
causes windows to store the clear text

322
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:27,090
version of your password in in RAM and
it goes to ram and just so you don't

323
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,100
need to crack passwords really much
anymore if you have access to the domain

324
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,520
controller you can you can literally
talk from the domain controller to host

325
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,600
and say hey host this powershell script
and it says here passer and have fun

326
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:46,189
with him so it's really need it helps
considerably one yes I just mention 11

327
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,750
organization was able to jump from there
from their corporate to me into their

328
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:55,570
super secure production to Maine because
all of this means reuse the passwords so

329
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,970
I own several workstations in the
several relations got me multiple sets

330
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,340
of credentials to talk to a lesser
number nine don't use the same password

331
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,970
for Active Directory has your Cisco
equipment or other demands if your vote

332
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,060
for my assume that your login creds get
compromised as well and if your login

333
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,399
credentials are compromised you have to
assume that if they're being used

334
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,280
elsewhere in the attack was gonna figure
that out

335
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,290
abused it this is a fun one

336
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,340
I was actually I see this in back in my
system in days so it's really cool that

337
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,929
your boxers have five thousand days of
time and it's really awesome that like

338
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:34,530
yeah stability but you're running kernel
2442 to that means it's trivial for

339
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,250
people to break into it and I've seen a
lot mainly financial organizations that

340
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,720
they have this abject unwillingness to
reboot anything especially if it's for

341
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,930
the sake of security or patching they
appear to be like completely overtly

342
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,490
allergic to rebooting so while not
rebooting certainly have time it tells

343
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,280
the attackers how older infrastructure
is greatly aids into breaking into those

344
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,570
particular systems so a fifteen year old
operating system Java and Flash from

345
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,159
five years ago any virus hasn't been
updated since 2006 and this list is long

346
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,100
and hearing ridiculous the most recent
occurrence of which I saw was an

347
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,980
organization

348
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,610
15 or so founder switches as their core
switching fabric and they had to reboot

349
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,428
of them in three years so the last thing
they did them all at once and the reason

350
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:23,799
that I was able to sort of discern that
fact was that they they after after this

351
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,410
incident which happened they admitted
that they run this script every night at

352
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,850
midnight which connects to the switches
and pulls config off them with taxing to

353
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:38,240
strip at his age and showrunner never
put off to file at some point we got

354
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,110
called in to do instant response and
every single switch went down in a row

355
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:48,240
one by one until all fourteen or fifteen
soldiers were all down and as it turns

356
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,030
out that they there was a memory leak
that was released several years before

357
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,860
it had been so long since they had patch
this which is they don't they denial of

358
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,590
service themselves because of their
unwillingness to patch like critical

359
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:06,649
infrastructure within the organization
for something as simple as having it in

360
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,520
the ass and it cost him several million
dollars because they were hosting people

361
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,879
that do stock trading sadly the
engineering people on that organization

362
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,179
are still there and they weren't fired
on the spot so maybe there's another

363
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,650
opportunity for that particular monster
to show its head so less than 10

364
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,260
stability is more important than uptime
reboot his shit and patches or you're

365
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,860
gonna have a bad time so this is a good
one

366
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,260
organizations that spend all of their
man hours meticulously grooming Office

367
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,379
documents usually for compliance audit
reasons instead of actually conducting

368
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,809
any kind of security of any kind there
is no they're not actually doing

369
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:50,280
anything in the documents are claiming
to do and from what I can tell enough of

370
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,168
the auditors don't bother looking past
the documentation to validate that stuff

371
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:59,549
is actually happening that a lot of
places get away with this they spend all

372
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:03,820
their time to the security organizations
spend the time with their faces down an

373
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,850
Excel and MS Word and never in a shell
or you know writing code so when Oregon

374
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,649
I'm aware of would take pen test report
and create an action plan from them and

375
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,460
then when they realize how much for
remediation was going to cost they spent

376
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,230
a month

377
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,480
strategically changing the language of
the report and the language of the

378
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,870
policies to make it look like they
passed all the

379
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,429
auditing so like here's a hundred and
thirty page pen test report they

380
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,300
literally did next to nothing they
changed the policy and they changed the

381
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,940
audit requirements so that they just
barely passed by the skin of their chief

382
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,290
and somehow this is ok and the like
we're doing security no I need scotch

383
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:46,720
desperately so they just squeaked by
spent months changing these documents in

384
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,450
like shops like sry the security
reactions tumblr exist so lesson 11 if

385
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,270
you actually have to do stuff you
actually have to do stuff to make

386
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,879
security work none of that stuff that
happens in MS or none of that ever

387
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,490
happens in the MS sweet like she just
happened in office it didn't happen in

388
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,590
exchange doesn't happen in Excel happens
in shell prompt and happens in code and

389
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,290
happens in hardware no Microsoft Word
documents Excel spreadsheet has ever

390
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:18,770
fixed a security posture pro problem and
I never will so please take this into

391
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:24,690
account when you go back to work on
Tuesday and shake people shaky cam

392
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:30,559
anybody that's familiar with the term
defense tration it's also an option so

393
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,200
these aren't the droids you're looking
for a good sometimes the answer is

394
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,840
literally running Junos so from time to
time

395
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,889
security researchers will feel generous
and they will find something that they

396
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,700
decided significant and they will submit
your organization the good guy types

397
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,770
will contact the manufacturer of
hardware software and they will say that

398
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,080
there's some sort of critical
vulnerability just to help make life

399
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,428
more secure sometimes offender listens
and sometimes I don't raise so building

400
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,650
up the whole responsible disclosure
discussion this is an example of when

401
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,309
they don't listen to design manufacture
some of you may be aware of at this

402
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:07,750
point a small one of these massive LED
billboards their configuration is

403
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,620
basically a cradlepoint modem or some
other piece of consumer equipment as the

404
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:20,120
gateway to the systems are on the sign a
Windows XP box XP emphasize a can access

405
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,300
camera that are sitting behind this
piece of consumer year the company such

406
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,129
default passwords like a lot of them do
and in this case they have two options

407
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,670
one of them is we will take care of the
sign for you and we will be the

408
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,890
custodian of the things that go to it

409
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:39,100
has not publicly accessible and the
other is here's a sign have fun so

410
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,389
anybody here but that sign in georgia
recently being kinda yeah so there's

411
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,150
this giant like two hundred foot led
billboard sign in Georgia that somebody

412
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,200
found the credentials to which I want
you are really really bad I won't give

413
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,170
you guys the credentials but if you can
find the company name then you know the

414
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:07,290
credentials they put go to hop on the
sign in this really popular corner in a

415
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,200
suburb of Georgia and it made the news
and people are saying that the FBI and

416
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,860
DHS were involved and blah blah blah
blah so this screenshot here that I have

417
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,879
was an email response I got from the
company to whom I tried to disclose the

418
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:31,830
problem I think this came in two days
after the sign had happened and on April

419
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,300
8 originally was a month before anything
happened I wrote them as a long email

420
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,649
saying hey founder signs on the Internet

421
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:44,080
they're all default Reds like this the
pic the cameras that I had up before I

422
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,409
started speaking where several of those
signs the cameras are minimal if you

423
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,840
know the default credit to the camera to
know that if all threads to the sign and

424
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,350
the cameras and I can this is
interesting the cameras are running

425
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:05,939
embedded Linux over maps and Metasploit
has nips payloads the cameras if you

426
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,630
login as admin have an upload
functionality so if you do the math

427
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:18,530
MSF mixed a load upload run you have
root on a camera none none of these

428
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:23,379
things log there's no friends it's
happening here you have like the corner

429
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,530
botnet the corner but it was like tens
of thousands or hundreds of thousands of

430
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,240
compromise can I think there were
cameras on the internet that were doing

431
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,000
some bad guy and there was entirely
because you know cameras default

432
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,410
passwords no logging no security

433
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,630
fun times so this is this guy is

434
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,790
credit he actually called me like
several days ago and he says like I just

435
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,050
want to make sure you understand I'm in
the business networking site of the

436
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,500
organization I don't work on the signs
that the whole different apartment I'm

437
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,620
not sure why they don't want to talk to
you but I wanted to let you know that

438
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,179
there is at least some people in the
organization that care about this stuff

439
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,500
just sadly not the people that matter so
much so this guy went out of his way to

440
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,980
help so I have to give them credit for
that I wanted to assuage any internet

441
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,890
iron that might go his way for not
helping he's he's in the position of

442
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,910
there's another part of the company that
made a mistake and its hands are tied

443
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,480
all you can do is suggest stuff and they
just ignore him so like less than twelve

444
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,610
what a security researcher contacts your
company to tell you about a problem it

445
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,229
means not only does that person know
about it means many many many many other

446
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,560
people know about not saying anything in
in the deliberation that I've had with a

447
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,090
different people on the internet and
Twitter and this guy I'm like this 6

448
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,230
through the seventh person to have
reported this problem to them I just

449
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,390
happened to be the lucky lucky lucky
enough to be the last guy who reported

450
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,520
it to them before there was a big PR
thing like goats on a sign in downtown

451
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,900
so it's the only reason my name is
attached to this in any way it's a

452
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,370
really good idea to take these security
folks seriously if they contact

453
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,550
organization and try and tell you that
their stuff wrong they're trying to help

454
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,350
even if you don't intend to fix the
problem you might want to police take

455
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,189
them seriously because stuff like this
might happen where the researcher will

456
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,280
say hey there's a company that I tried
to help and they literally give no fucks

457
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,690
and that's a problem for a lot of people
expect people that spent maybe hundreds

458
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:22,190
of thousands of dollars on these mammoth
signs they sell their what they're

459
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,140
usually telling you is at your your
pants down and you should probably see

460
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,440
about pulling them back up so I know the
guy did was to help a company

461
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,160
establishes its stock they had a
moderately to develop security program

462
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,760
and they had a saying they had some
procedures in place and things like that

463
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,610
but during that game there was one guy
who would log into the same highlight

464
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:49,649
2,000 to 10,000 alert in the same and
just delete them like at a time like

465
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,670
control a boot so I thought was pretty
astonishing and I sort of one white in

466
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,980
the face when I found this out I watched
her do it over and over again every day

467
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,380
so I'm fairly certain the guys still
works there

468
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,980
astonishingly and this guy would just
leave thousands of alerts without any

469
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,980
review whatsoever of any kind of course
as incidents would happen there would be

470
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,179
nothing in the tool that we were using
to track networks forensic happening so

471
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,590
we'd find compromised hosts and then be
no evidence to speak of how they are

472
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,980
compromised hosts they were talking to
on the internet and we're pulling your

473
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,030
hair out trying to figure out where you
how many hundreds of thousands or

474
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,169
millions of dollars were spent on this
seemed to love how many people have

475
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:34,100
full-time jobs doing nothing but
maintaining this tool and here in 19 the

476
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,230
song just deleting all the evidence of
bad feeling in the entire organ some

477
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,520
people are scratching their heads the
bad guys get stuff how do they get past

478
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,550
our tools and it turns out when you
pointed a guy on staff and say maybe

479
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,129
this guy is actively helping the bad
guys don't like that so much against a

480
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:54,159
very colorful

481
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,550
lesson 13 make sure that your security
staff knows that there are consequences

482
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,770
to helping attackers especially if
they're doing it out of their own

483
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,150
laziness in situations like that it's a
good idea to make an example out of

484
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:08,730
these people I mean it's it's mean but
put yourself in the sea so position

485
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,460
yourself as the guy that needs to talk
to the board

486
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,960
you're gonna be sat in front of a board
of people that are conducting the

487
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,890
business and you know they have tens of
millions of dollars in budget and you

488
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,930
have to explain to this this board why
somebody on your staff was actively

489
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,810
deleting evidence that would normally be
used to find bad guys that committed

490
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:32,470
felonies so you're gonna have a bad time
and now the fun part the penitentiary

491
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:38,480
fails let me play you the song of my
people getting so we move on the part of

492
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,800
the talk here we're talking about
attackers failing really really hard

493
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,930
it's easy to talk smack as pensioners
really easy to talk smack about about

494
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,589
customers and clients that that fail
miserably and how they're doing security

495
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,830
wrong and things like that and huge
public engineering feels like I'm

496
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:54,369
described from the point of view
attacker but make no mistake the Act

497
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,470
hackers have derp to the have quite a
lot of derp let me sing you the song of

498
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:04,700
my people so as it turns out using mass
can on a client probably isn't a good

499
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,259
idea if you have a trench all the way up

500
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,230
firewalls I have deep packet inspection
turned on or next-generation firewalls I

501
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,150
have a bunch of bells and whistles
turned on

502
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,070
literally never take into account the
fact that firewall is going to get

503
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,510
scanned and not always by the good guys
so it's it's it's entertaining for the

504
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,950
folks in the room that remember when
sinn cookies started making it in kernel

505
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:27,759
like they were invented to fix this
problem and now the vendors have undone

506
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,780
that they've been trolled zine security
in the kernel for the sake of adding

507
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:41,960
line items to cheat for firewalls now
there are all vendors actually think

508
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,140
this is a security feature to like to
listen on all ports for example if

509
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,910
anyone has ever asked and I think
checkpoint is one of them and a couple

510
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,040
other ones that they think that confused
port scanners your porch and something

511
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,920
and I'll tell you that every single port
is open to that end map that fire was

512
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,860
gonna have a bad time so lesson 14
presume your plants have guys on their

513
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:08,180
team that run their gear at 90% presume
that nmap Dashti for will take it down

514
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:13,890
infrastructure also realize that some
genius firewall for world's firmwares

515
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,319
will create sessions for UDP traffic as
well so if you do a UDP scan that's

516
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,610
another sure-fire way of ending up
having a bad time so as a paid attacker

517
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,430
you also have to take into consideration
that not everyone is going to properly

518
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,509
configure web servers are logging
servers are things of that nature seems

519
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,730
database servers in almost every case
pointing a web app scanner at a site and

520
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,920
walking away is generally a bad idea
especially if the extent that's the

521
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,170
extent of the work that you put into the
test if let's see what's happening on

522
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:50,770
the back end is that every nearly every
40 for 500 200 and every little log

523
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:56,210
message that you're creating is landing
in a log somewhere and if the client is

524
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,600
following the frustratingly bizarre
school of thought where / var some for

525
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,049
some reason a two gig partition you're
going to fill up the partition with

526
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:09,060
Apache or nginx logs and it'll cause the
pasta tip over the same goes for iOS

527
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,060
hosts who make a 10 gig D Drive and for
some reason stick IIS logs on the D

528
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,549
Drive in addition to other things like C

529
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,420
so usually one of the boxes go down
during a penthouse clientele after the

530
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,200
bad taste in their mouths and you're
unlikely to see return business

531
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,710
especially if you cause a production
outage so less than 15 don't throw the

532
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,330
kitchen sink at your client unless you
know that they can take it make sure to

533
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,840
ask questions during the scoping call
about how they're logging is configured

534
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,020
where they store databases find the
system in the setup was to give our

535
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:48,540
petitions and shake them there's gonna
be a lot of shaking on rare conditions

536
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,250
when a customer has externally facing
assets configured to authenticate

537
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,150
against Active Directory you run the
risk of a locking users accounts if

538
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:00,420
you're if you're doing brute forcing of
any kind and causing outages you're

539
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,130
trying to boot forced some person in
finance and they're working on the

540
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,770
company's quarterly budget and their
machine locks up because their account

541
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,500
is locked

542
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,660
they're gonna get angry about it I'm
pretty sure it's rare to actually find a

543
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,910
shop that has this type of setup
forward-looking brute force exchange

544
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,750
then it will cause people to come to get
locked but they are out there and I've

545
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:26,120
heard about them you run the risk of
walking the count the risk of locking

546
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,049
the counters higher if you do brute
forcing from the inside

547
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,560
to be sure almost everything on the
inside is gonna have to authenticate

548
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,450
against Active Directory you lock
accounts very very quickly I found it

549
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,089
easier to use something like me catch on
a shared workstation and work your way

550
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,980
up to being a domain admin than it is to
try and brute force anything to begin

551
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,070
with what ya doing admin and all the
credentials you don't really need to

552
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,690
brute-force anymore as if you have to me
that mean you could just targeting

553
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:55,150
workstation users say I want that person
spreads and give them to you to listen

554
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,060
15 hit them where they're soft not where
they're expecting you should really be

555
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,220
kind of a last ditch effort to begin
with so occasionally mistakes were made

556
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:10,230
perhaps you're using a system that's
perhaps using a system that

557
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:17,770
configured using multiple identities
perhaps in on the system using to

558
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,930
conduct fishing expeditions campaigns
and perhaps the drop-down window that

559
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,470
you select Change Idec your identity is
directly above or below the one that

560
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:31,598
you're using normally day today so maybe
one client accidentally fishes and other

561
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,690
maybe you send the fish from your
personal email instead of the big 12

562
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,050
you've created these things tend to
happen the fun part about this is that

563
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,480
companies rarely actually follow up on
the phishing campaigns if you count the

564
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,170
fish came from looks legitimate they
will presume that account got hacked and

565
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,609
they will not think anything of it if
they even have a response it's usually

566
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:54,910
just adding a filter to the mail server
or whatever mail processing systems that

567
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,690
use to make sure that that center can
send to the company anymore and just

568
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,589
drop the mail although if you've been
hired to do the sneaky sneaky and you

569
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:04,779
out of health

570
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,410
you might see points against your the
report it's definitely not a big deal if

571
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:14,328
you get the access you need a way
meaning if you if you get access to an

572
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:17,480
organization and they catch you haven't
done the things you did you have a bunch

573
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,250
of shells and doesn't matter if you're
already all over their land to listen

574
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,470
over sixteen details matter when you're
pretending to be somebody else like this

575
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:31,720
all is said and done last year don't
fuck it up so this is the fun times with

576
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,290
physical assessments it's a good idea to
gauge if the tool that you're using is

577
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:39,800
the one you should be using to do the
job in this case if you used the wrong

578
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,050
tool on say it kensington laptop tether
the tubular kind and you destroy the

579
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:50,109
lock you've now basically permanently
tethered this laptop to a task or worse

580
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:53,109
if you destroy combination lock that
keeping shed shot or get shot or

581
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:56,359
anything like that you basically
permanently shut the lock until Apple

582
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:00,759
cutter gets involved so let another 17
don't actually turn to walk into an

583
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,700
insurmountable obstacle make sure that
you don't overdo it so many Web

584
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,480
applications have admin functionality
for GV management and other towards

585
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,680
functionality that will touch files
checked all the things on the back end a

586
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,348
lot of what a vacation scanners will
just blindly scan every single foreman

587
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,530
hid everything a button for the sake of
testing if you put those two together

588
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,220
get deleted database deleted databases
arbitrary files written to the disk

589
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:32,899
partitions mountain to mountain all
sorts of weird bizarre stuff that's not

590
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,220
supposed to happen

591
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,490
backups of nothing overwritten fields in
the lot of mayhem so this sort of stuff

592
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,040
is why people in the security industry
make fun of what we call scan shops

593
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,960
places that just pointed a scanner at a
website or or or piece of infrastructure

594
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,960
and walk away and you know the work
companies are just run at rule against

595
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,050
the site they call that a penchant for
those thoughts like those sorts of shops

596
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:00,740
tend not to get a lot of return business
number eighteen don't nuclear customers

597
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,029
web app because you see about
configuring your scanning tool ask these

598
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,490
sorts of questions during the scoping
call because this sort of gig this sort

599
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:13,819
of mistake could cost the company the
gig or cost you your job and it will

600
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,619
definitely cost you return business so
when communicating risk to stakeholders

601
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:23,980
or in plain English when telling people
who are responsible for things that

602
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,210
those things might have a problem that
could ruin their day or month or weaker

603
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:32,349
here it's important to be very selective
about your language I was told a story

604
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:35,810
once by someone that involved finding
one billion a school system the

605
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,040
realization that this could turn into a
gig then approaching the school and

606
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,490
saying something like and I quote I
found you guys have this huge problem by

607
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,720
how the solution but I'm not going to
give it to you unless you pay me I

608
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,279
forget the exact details since this was
several years ago but I think the words

609
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,810
blackmail or espionage reused and the
guy didn't have a good time no less than

610
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,520
eighteen words mean things they really
do no matter how much you flaunt your

611
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,869
disregarded the English language the
rest of us actually use it the precise

612
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:08,170
with your words otherwise you're gonna
have a bad time the fun part about doing

613
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,970
attack simulation is the part where you
get a letter absolving you have any

614
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,740
crimes you commit on behalf of your
company for conducting this assessment

615
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,529
it's kind of a get out of jail free card
there really handy to have on your

616
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,730
person if you're doing physical
assessments gives you legal permission

617
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,670
to attack the company like a real
adversary would you wait at least on the

618
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,960
go away in these types of scenarios you
have a physical letter to carry around

619
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,140
in case you get caught so you don't
actually go to jail and a smaller

620
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,520
engagements like extra

621
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,990
the customer typically asks for the
source IP address so that they can

622
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,790
whitelist did or put it in a separate
pile in their learning tools to make

623
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:46,490
sure that people don't actually conduct
incident response on it sometimes they

624
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:53,279
do depending on how black bag you this
engagement is renting engagements are

625
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,610
supposed to be healthy and when you're
doing any of this kind of work stay in

626
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,120
Scopus generally a really really good
idea so I heard a story about a guy who

627
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,259
decided to go away off restoration
during web application pentosin since he

628
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,490
wasn't getting his rocks off doing the
web at penthouse he decided he throw ins

629
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,220
and social engineering for free

630
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,149
the short version that went terribly
terribly wrong he got caught and was

631
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,500
basically fired on the spot leaving his
company to deal with the legal

632
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,770
repercussions in a very angry customer
because they thought they were being

633
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:24,730
attacked and this guy basically
conducted committing felonies because he

634
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:28,330
thought that it would make him look
better on Pinterest no less than 20

635
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,440
scope is very important especially on
engagements were few people know that

636
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,800
you're coming only give the customer
exactly what they want and what they

637
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,270
paid for anything extra in this case is
like your stylist giving you free extra

638
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,910
work during a haircut

639
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:46,259
just leave your really pissed off so
it's it's routine to see attorneys

640
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,400
getting involved with reviewing
statements of work in the legal

641
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,220
documentation pertaining pertaining to
Penn tests and especially the wording

642
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,649
and a lot of the details and talking
points the pitfall you can get into his

643
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,650
attorneys realize that they can wedge
themselves into the process and charged

644
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,230
extra hours by changing the wording of
documents in question to specifically

645
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,540
caused the documents to need further
attention by attorneys

646
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,110
specifically if you find that your
statement of work for penthouse

647
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:13,730
magically now includes instant response
or mediation after the attorney reviewed

648
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,940
it you should make it clear that those
are not typically part of a pen test the

649
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,490
typically separate engagements and they
cost extra if you may also like to

650
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,520
change the language in the contract
protecting you from those ninety percent

651
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,660
DCP section session network and herbs so
they'll try to make that your fault they

652
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,060
will try and put into the document that
if you tip over a firewall you cause

653
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,509
production outage that your company will
be held legally liable even though we

654
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:41,110
know full well that they're 9% TCP
session that worked for running the shop

655
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:45,040
so if you breathe on her own little over
then suddenly have a

656
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:52,920
legal so lesson 21 if the attorneys are
involved you gonna have to put on your

657
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,110
goggles when you're in the documentation
after you get back to the lawyers it's

658
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,440
not uncommon for them to slip something
in there and hope that you don't notice

659
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:07,290
and so now we have effectively 2021 land
mines let's talk about what happens if

660
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:12,009
you step on one so if your organization
has a huge failure and it's not on the

661
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:16,480
news yet there are several ways to keep
quiet or at least lessen the blow if

662
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,350
customer data was leaked then you're
legally obligated to disclose that there

663
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:22,420
was a breach if there was no customer
delete it then you're not legally

664
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,410
obligated to disclose so this can go go
two ways one you can try and hide it but

665
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,290
when the news finds out you're gonna
look really bad to you can cop to it and

666
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,000
don't lie about your capabilities the
public would rather hear yes we got

667
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,630
breached we know what we did wrong and
we're fixing it stay tuned for an update

668
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,000
on what we're trying to do to improve
our security posture but then you

669
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,870
actually have to deliver you can't make
a statement like that and not deliver

670
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:50,880
otherwise you'll likely become targets
again shown me if I had to guess I'd say

671
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,540
that Home Depot and target are also
being attacked because of their

672
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,410
lackluster public responses to breaches
don't make yourself the target by lying

673
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:58,089
to the press

674
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:02,660
don't talk to the press in the gym they
say something reassuring bland corporate

675
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,250
statement still the attackers that
you're only doing the bare minimum and

676
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,300
companies that do the bare minimum just
continued to get owned in large

677
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,100
organizations there's generally a PR
oppressed department that will do all of

678
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:17,049
the interfacing with the press for you
if you do your best to arm those people

679
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,670
or that person with the proper
nomenclature to sound to not sound like

680
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,700
an imbecile in-camera the better those
folks look the better your organization

681
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,689
looks and the better you look there the
public face of your response effectively

682
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:34,400
if you take the time are taken to
conferences teaching how to pick locks

683
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,420
make sure that they are aware that
hackers are actually scary and there

684
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,660
were friendly people they will have your
back and they will take the time to get

685
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:45,270
it right so attitude counts for a lot
more organizations appear person who

686
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:50,070
does all the Interfaith Council I if you
if you get on stage

687
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,230
and in front of the press and you angry
or you sound defensive sort of goes back

688
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:02,270
to the last talking point where you
sound like a lackluster landed public

689
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,580
response or if you don't own up to being
alone and releasing tens of thousands or

690
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,200
millions of pieces of customer records
you're going to make yourself targets

691
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,930
you're telling secondary attackers that
not only do not care about the first

692
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,310
attack but we we continue to get
attacked which basically means other

693
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:23,779
attackers can continue to harp on your
company and they don't have to fear

694
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,349
incarceration legal recourse timing
matters especially when you talk about

695
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:31,020
public beaches and talking to the press
if you know that you've been breached

696
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,580
and you have a company blog you wanna
issue periodic updates and how you're

697
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,970
doing in the remediation faces
especially if customer data has been

698
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,589
touched its pointless to try an issue
holler empty bland corporate statements

699
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:44,730
that mean nothing if you want to avert
the press digging into something that

700
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,760
you said vaguely to try to hide the
truth than you want to make sure that

701
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,950
you give the public what is reasonable
to believe that they want before they

702
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,330
actually have to ask for it

703
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:56,279
give them a reason to think wow these
guys are on top of this very likely come

704
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:56,869
out on top

705
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:00,950
have a plan for when something breaks
take the time to come up with scenarios

706
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,049
of what would happen if and play the
part of the bag I have a written plain

707
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:09,890
English and for operations team to
follow if anything happens if it doesn't

708
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:13,330
have to be formalized it doesn't have to
be stand for the company logos as you

709
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:16,790
can literally just be a turnover with a
bunch of talking like bullet points I

710
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,470
just have to be wordsmith for
consumption in literally just have to go

711
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:24,180
to the people that will be doing is
response bullet point list preparing

712
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,750
even a little bit goes a really really
long way during instant response so

713
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,109
during a breach nerves will be afraid
people will be stressed and they will be

714
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:35,420
shouting and likely panic people would
interrupt you with lots of questions and

715
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,869
demands for status updates and during
all of this will likely be pressured and

716
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:43,089
suffer some level of anxiety it will
help to have sources to look up findings

717
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:44,170
here is a great one

718
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,030
Intel . critical stack dot com I didn't
put on the slide if nothing else to

719
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:52,500
start with looking a firewall logs and
outbound traffic on port that your order

720
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,820
doesn't use our country that your or
countries or doesn't do business with if

721
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,170
neither of those pieces of data if you
have neither of those then you want to

722
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,440
get something like security onion

723
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,369
or on some box and you're gonna put it
in line with traffic as quickly as

724
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:10,290
possible and listen to a top so you can
see what's actually happening so here's

725
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:15,259
a total of all the lessons learned have
two minutes so please take a photo or

726
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:20,069
finally for the slide or something up
for a moment but this is effectively the

727
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:41,490
TLDR for the entire talk to Cassie says
they get jail card only protect you from

728
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:45,118
company claims and not state claims she
something that makes the state of the

729
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,119
federal government angry they get into
jail card doesn't really help

730
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:03,560
thank you very much for allowing me to
come here and you guys
