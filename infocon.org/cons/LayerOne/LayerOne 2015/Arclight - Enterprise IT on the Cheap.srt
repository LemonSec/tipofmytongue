1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,850
unification of CTF that ends at the end
of this talk if you are going to the 23

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:15,150
after party what time should I be there
are ok so the at the after parties at

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,230
the 23 be shop you could find the
address online or talk to this gentleman

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,920
after his talk he has lots of business
cards if you'd like to write it down it

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:31,140
is 418 East Commonwealth number one
bullet in California 92832 and its

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,579
shopped out 23 be dot org

7
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:37,180
coming up next is John Norman with
enterprise I T on the cheap

8
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:09,500
my day job I work for a company called
advances in your sponsors this year I do

9
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,030
a lot of work with her spend time going
all over Southern California and beyond

10
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:21,400
busy helping customers with enterprise
storage backup recovery Dr networking

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,950
solutions and one of the things that
comes up from time to time both in our

12
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,659
personal lives we wanted to loud we've
got you know

13
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,450
something we need to do we have a
brother-in-law that the news weddings

14
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,390
and hasn't returned my duty to protect
and we can't really offer them the kind

15
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,399
of solutions that we might want to
customers so I came up with the

16
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,959
presentation just going to give you an
overview of some of my tricks I picked

17
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:54,500
up along the way whether you're building
your testing lab or her space for your

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,439
father in law's business was 10.2 cells
on wheels

19
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,458
this is something I help you so little
about you know why are doing this this

20
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:10,079
is not a complete how do i Teor how to
internet I'm leaving a lot of holes and

21
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:14,099
I'm probably not going to cover your
favorite pet solution product open

22
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,569
source solution these are just some of
the ones that I know that it worked for

23
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:23,708
me that being said you know let's go
into this is the first few definitions

24
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:31,030
we talk about enterprise hardware and
software I put it in Riley County rise

25
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,319
solutions into two categories enterprise
which should be stuff intended for

26
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,510
large-scale deployment very robust and
consumer stuff mostly designed for a low

27
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:51,298
price point two hits what we call the
soho the market these products how specs

28
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:52,660
and times are very similar

29
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,660
they're sold by some of the same vendors
what we do

30
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,930
company or a few people have seen my
talk about reverse engineering we take

31
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,130
apart things will go what's inside

32
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,910
well most striking difference when you
start on something you know if you take

33
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,120
one of these units apart

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,419
you'll see the Bill Polian to play on
enterprise here

35
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,880
different you're gonna see counselors
and power supplies that are over-sized

36
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,880
to rate its work not die

37
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,569
found out to be designed for a hundred
percent duty cycle the rate of specs are

38
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,749
overrated specs are often very
conservative as far as power cooling the

39
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:35,959
number of packets per second is not
under ideal conditions sometimes it's

40
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,450
under a you know a typical sampling of
their customers conditions the pain the

41
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,129
vendor to see a lot of hardware and
software / firmware testing that's

42
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,018
happened a lot of these vendors make
stuff that's very large and

43
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,840
carrier-class everything done they've
been there many times mirror is really

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,069
well tested and impact you also see
interesting features like hardware

45
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,958
watchdog so how many of you have been in
a coffee shop in the internet doesn't

46
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,260
work for Bristol in da house to resent
it and that's within three or four times

47
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,090
a day and you get a Starbucks without
ever really happen to you unless the

48
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,810
whole place is down its that's kind of
the difference between you know how much

49
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,099
intervention is needed

50
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:24,229
did a min themselves as they're learning
that make something fixed quickly in

51
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:30,430
generally we have focus on ease of use
for consumer here you have no worries

52
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,830
and wizards enterprise near may have
them but they're simply also a fairly

53
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,710
robust command line interface you do
things when you need to go off the

54
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,729
reservation or outside of the Quick
Start and more things we have products

55
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,000
the very long product life cycle so if
you put in a solution now it's likely to

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,770
be simple with the same product or one
that's more or less dropping her place

57
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,940
in five years three or five years from
now with all this is broader sense it

58
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,349
some of our vendors this is a very small
handful of stuff you see it

59
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:10,219
companies right social networks are
about to make wireless gear we

60
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:15,409
considered it up in touching distance
cheer one storage vendors HP does

61
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:20,639
everything from most of its share one
since not quite sure one tell-all behind

62
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,949
some tier 1 and down the consumer as
well but more or less these are

63
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,770
companies that have

64
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:35,219
a long time that offer you a contractor
most important consumer products

65
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,690
sometimes they are very similar products
and even using the same chips and where

66
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,520
Linux kernel but typically they
intentionally lockout features they want

67
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,370
you to operate at some point in the
Enterprise version they may also just

68
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,940
locking out to keep you from hurting
yourself and there's often no CLI or you

69
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,669
know a limited feature set deliberately
these products are more subject to

70
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,299
mysteries crashes when I call sheet
deaths also plastic things you have a

71
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,580
switch or router or firewall stuff like
that in the closet that's closed and

72
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,440
some point they start dropping packets
you resented sometimes they work again

73
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,240
sometimes they don't

74
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,490
and eventually just gets cut you know
that doesn't happen

75
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,020
seem to happen so much more than just
design and around it

76
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,448
another thing about the product
lifecycle they may very well find a

77
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:30,870
cheaper mentor to supply and making
themselves so your favor a particular

78
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,530
brand you know so the router may be
discontinued and make it replaces

79
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,440
something that has a completely
different hardware and software stack

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,710
and all of your customization or scripts
imagine how to make work may never be

81
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,349
held again this is really important it's
one thing to have a simple network here

82
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,099
which is changeable this is really a
problem with storage the house all your

83
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:52,889
life on it

84
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,319
manage though it's cheap rate you can
buy the best wire fraud as or whatever

85
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,430
and you know it'll get you going I put
all of these centers in here

86
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,700
Belkin is now

87
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,180
Linksys or Linksys is left off they got
acquired by Belkin couple years ago

88
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,300
missus is moving into the cheap and
cheerful small office home office market

89
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,310
tp-link as a company on taiwan their
main advantage is that they have some

90
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,580
products that are really easy to break
into Andrea firmware is well documented

91
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,690
chipsets and then of course we had to do
list you know next year that's the

92
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,540
purple sweatshirts hiding in every
office and we're doing something

93
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,910
important I find it now functioning so
what are you trying to do when we talk

94
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,030
about wanting to have something that
looks like a robust enterprise network I

95
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,260
think what we have at work or work for
money you know how would they do that

96
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,590
what kind of services lil after you know
whether it's for yourself or allow maybe

97
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,549
it's for a hackerspace Nagar setting
something up for the Boys and Girls Club

98
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,480
whatever happens to me your university
first thing to do is like to get go down

99
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,890
the road this is called tac I want to
stack but we really have to stop and

100
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:15,280
think what are we trying to do yes you
know your goal is to make count drawings

101
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,000
and occasionally internet and write
letters your needs a lot different than

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,360
someone who needs to indicate it for que
me Dio and chances are the solutions

103
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,910
that you know are prepared for one or
overkill and not appropriate for another

104
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:35,020
bottom line though is needs should get
to find initiative drives offer choices

105
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,299
and software is what we are ultimately
the plane hardware and it works all that

106
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,589
stuff to support no need my as a drill
necessarily because I want to drill they

107
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:49,550
buy because they need so we should think
in terms of our instead what we want to

108
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,290
achieve were you know what kinds of
things we need to work really well what

109
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,339
kinds of things make us money for
consulting what kinds of things may turn

110
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:03,570
out of there down we just one in general
and women are still in school pre kills

111
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,110
every kind of project we doin time you
know there's a nice to have

112
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,729
their house and we should really start
with the frontier towns and finding out

113
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,700
what kind of software and what kind of
services we need to make that happen in

114
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,550
this building

115
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,810
first thing to look at this is something
that happens all the time you know you

116
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,609
have managers and people your work that
you know find the magazine unfortunately

117
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,270
in the men's room and start saying
things like cloud cloud cloud platform

118
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,829
really mindlessly without actually
having considered the implications of

119
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:43,230
this means doctors to be very
distrustful of things we don't know

120
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,100
in fundamentally the cloud is awesome
deals computer right now being said we

121
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,770
have to understand that there are things
I would call commodities or jelly beans

122
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,439
that everybody else has that problem

123
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,590
very few people have a problem in such a
way that that's the thing that they want

124
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,520
to do to make money it's a fine line
thing and something you have to do to

125
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,010
get arrested what you do and something
else is probably solve it better faster

126
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,470
and cheaper than you can were still the
two million people and my version of the

127
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,870
bugs worked out things at home that
kinda great when palestine an email

128
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:25,630
exchange on margin no system that sucks
right away too

129
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,780
to make a lot of those problems Nissan
else's problem would you be able to

130
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,140
spend more time doing whatever is your
company does to make money that's

131
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,080
possible especially if you're not so big
or have such a critical security means

132
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,920
you know it's absolutely painful to have
it done with somebody else if you need

133
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,520
to know something like WordPress well
there are plenty of companies millions

134
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,439
of WordPress sites and yet stinky and
broken and has engineering limitations

135
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,880
in many ways but someone who would press
sites it's almost guaranteed that the

136
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,430
latest will hit their first 20,000
customers and then get stopped by even

137
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,770
the least competent shop eventually in
trouble before it gets to you just buy

138
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:14,750
her community something else if you do
something that is very specific industry

139
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,030
you are doing stuff for a tax
preparation office or maybe

140
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:26,519
you know Medical Center where point of
sale system for outside you have and you

141
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:35,139
have the option of yourself off site it
may be that the time you taking all of

142
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:39,499
the backup recovery regulatory
requirements what have you done losses

143
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:44,179
get this listed for 250 a month and
doing a rate yourself would be twenty

144
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:49,819
hours overtime loss initial $25,000
investment or maybe something like adobe

145
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:54,368
creative suite where you have to you can
either buy an upfront or you can pay a

146
00:11:54,369 --> 00:12:01,519
subscription costs and that kind of cash
flow management were just the ability to

147
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,420
not have to think about upgrades
warehousing and manage crashes and

148
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,319
dependencies for you might be worth it
you know something that's very specific

149
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,618
industry there's me not be a good reason
to want to do it yourself something

150
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:19,269
about you know if you have a lot of
collaboration needs a lot of source code

151
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:25,129
yes you can send a VPN and security and
trust relationships with contractors and

152
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:29,660
developers and you can bring your own
original get system doesn't make sense

153
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,990
to just paying some money and how their
home go away so that you can go back to

154
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,040
writing code like if that's what you do
for a living in my right well you know

155
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,629
you have to tell your time as an hourly
rate and decide if it's worth it

156
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:48,240
and licensing models for a lot of these
places throughout up a number of months

157
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,290
you pay between upgrades versus the
number you know three months you get

158
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,540
before you have to pay for an upgrade
you need even money and you could have

159
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,420
just said something the work so

160
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:05,909
first off you know we have that
discussion and off site are hosted

161
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:10,439
outperformer we should realize that
something is just absolutely got a house

162
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:14,949
to live on-site local file storage I'm
of the opinion that you don't know

163
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:18,799
anything for your company's assets if
you don't have a copy of those

164
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,869
physically under your control maybe a
call or something like that

165
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:28,189
everything you own period and historians
trusted someone else you're also

166
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:32,189
trusting like your accounting person to
pay the bill to trusting them not to go

167
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:35,909
bankrupt and I'll tell you your trip a
lot of trust and other people you have

168
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,239
no visibility is less have no visibility
into so I'm of the opinion that you

169
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,899
should always have something whether
it's a primary copy that you working

170
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,859
locally in that maybe is locked up
somewhere else or you have a primary

171
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:52,059
copy all science that's backed up at
intervals locally that you should only

172
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:57,228
copy of everything that is important to
you in order to use just not anything

173
00:13:57,229 --> 00:14:01,949
these days get anything done we have to
have internets and we have to have no

174
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:07,628
network they can get us into off-site
resources were gonna send to our home

175
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:11,970
site when we're traveling to remote
obviously we have to have security baked

176
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,279
into all this we have to have the
ability to do you know get ourselves

177
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,229
securely and do some basic no firewall
into the water

178
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:25,879
malicious after protection you know
where we said our response down on out

179
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:31,649
is Justin debate and then you will have
to a very basic things it's even though

180
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:36,119
its 2015 we still have printing and
scanning and document

181
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:43,100
various kinds of multimedia up to trade
some riders and portable hard drives and

182
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,399
DVDs with you know clients to deliver
work and stuff like that so there's

183
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,970
stuff that just hasn't on-site I think
we all regret that we go back to that

184
00:14:53,970 --> 00:15:00,660
where do we put stuff do we do an onsite
or offsite do you know what are you

185
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,930
trying to do we start with software
obviously a lot of us are promoting for

186
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:11,660
software and I am too I have kind of a
sort of a checklist I go through to see

187
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,510
it doesn't make sense and the first
thing I start with if we look at things

188
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:20,850
like office applications stuff like that
there is a recognized standard like

189
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,360
microsoft office in something like
eighty percent off interoperability or

190
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,310
future complete its ok if I edit photos
occasionally to change my sandwich board

191
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:37,040
menu I'm certain it's fine if I they can
t shirts maybe in Scopus line or maybe I

192
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,500
really need a real licensed copy of
Adobe product or something like that the

193
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,430
key is how do I make money with this or
is this a sign distraction that I have

194
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,229
to deal with in order to do business and
I would argue with you know by the best

195
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,820
fastest sharpest tools for things and
making money and consider a little bit

196
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,360
more Jackie or less robust open source
solution if it's something that doesn't

197
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,630
also your time

198
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,820
write something that can save me time
was a something that's even money when I

199
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,449
look at free solutions I like to start
with you know count is their main stream

200
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:19,120
free solution so something like game or
you know or firewalls they have a good

201
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,760
user can be there to play by hundreds or
thousands of people with you know

202
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,160
probably throughout the whole future
stack if you're looking at three

203
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,230
different completely competing

204
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,590
Office Suite applications at all three I
would pick one that has the best

205
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,060
community support has the highest
adoption it's probably not the best one

206
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:44,560
you know where they're not the best
jurors probably but there is such a can

207
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,859
around them that finding help with
something that has no company can buy a

208
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,760
support contract less perhaps you know
that that may be more important than the

209
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,680
absolute engineering and teacher
completeness of it getting something of

210
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,280
a high adoption and lots of easy to
search archives and theorems and so

211
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,190
forth and that usually means there's
also a committee of people that you can

212
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:15,900
browse hire you need something done our
customers so commercial software this is

213
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,130
also something we've got to do with
anything we do that makes us money that

214
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,030
you know runs on ARM hardware someone
somewhere is probably not going to be

215
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,500
creative

216
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:33,590
no strings attached or you know GPO
we're going to play a little while the

217
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,350
source commercial software I'm not
opposed to using a blend of both of

218
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,469
those I think we have to remember that
we're building environment where I just

219
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,480
making a political statement we're just
trying to get the job done most of the

220
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,110
time we have a variety of things like
hypervisors I comes in we have virtual

221
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:58,229
box we have abs and we've got you know
probably five or six others I'm

222
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,810
forgetting about I like VMware myself
personally the reason I like that is

223
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,720
that everything can be managed from the
CLI it has its own OS I don't have to

224
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,070
perhaps burned myself you know any
Microsoft license to run hyper-v I don't

225
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,450
have to install Red House a and
separately patches and it has an upgrade

226
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,660
it has everything even in the free
version that can be managed

227
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,740
you know from the command line so I can
do most things I would need to do

228
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,540
everything went back into the very
limited management tools that come with

229
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,460
it because it has a sea lion and
scripting and association tools like

230
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,310
that we like also important if we think
this is something that will grow or

231
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,560
simply that made any money now but might
in the future

232
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:51,280
having a robust enterprise solution with
all the bells and whistles is there such

233
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,100
a path if there is a product that might
sway my decision a little bit another

234
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,189
thing to look at

235
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,170
we really hate doing things like
antivirus and security software and

236
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:08,140
stuff like that oftentimes it comes
bundled with PCs we get some runs out

237
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:14,730
that never gets updated or whatever I'm
a fan of looking to maybe the church you

238
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,790
and territory in those lesser-known
meanders along those companies have

239
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:27,730
stuff that the default 2005 user license
or $100 for one user into 5410 users

240
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,700
simply means you have to look at those
maybe lesser-known solutions for Mrs

241
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,730
just the licensing side in their
technical reasons any of these are

242
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,860
better or worse but I will give you
lessons for everybody on site or a

243
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,709
pretty reasonable price and they don't
require the same kind of burdens and

244
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,810
channel server and agreement and
whatever that may be some of the bigger

245
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:57,050
owners have to do this sort of thing to
stay competitive under the covers some

246
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,610
of our security solutions may be using
the same engine they're just working at

247
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,560
a different price points through
different companies so that's the kind

248
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,830
of thing the internets reading for

249
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,000
times

250
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,790
you know word of mouth you get to find
out you know that there may be three or

251
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:18,070
four nominally identical solutions you
can buy in a way that's more favorable

252
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,050
to you if you're not a big customer
purchasing power

253
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:28,110
the other thing a lot of our commercial
software vendors how free out on me if

254
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:36,219
you've already paid for the basis for
some product you have features that

255
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,450
aren't necessarily advertised but just
exist can do very very powerful things

256
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,140
image from Microsoft that's a great
response and mitigation tool that's

257
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:53,920
available and it's free just something
new and look for a noted so we can offer

258
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,870
you know again if we find particular you
know applications we need are just going

259
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,879
to be able we need to run our business
urged you are testing elaborate over you

260
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,900
know we don't want to buy the whole farm
application vendors to sell us stuff

261
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,960
they like to start with me

262
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,430
enterprise and the double clinton's lead
on the sidelines and the five years to

263
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,680
support unless you don't want you so
this kind of car is being educated

264
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,450
consumer you never had to deal with say
it can be like computer associates you

265
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,260
know when I say they like to sell you a
framework and then they'd like to see

266
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,360
you they don't want to tell you this one
thing you want to sell you their entire

267
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,199
moderate modular framework which then
when you get down to the corner as a

268
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,310
server and that server requires a data
base and mattress former licensure and

269
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:42,530
pretty soon it's really complex you may
find that there is a point solution that

270
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,720
will do what you want

271
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,370
Francis like HP rather than buying do if
you have a whole bunch networking is

272
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,379
used to manage the contigs they have
something called intelligent management

273
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,810
console starts at like 1500 bucks that
is just a one-trick pony that just now

274
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,379
is not working things but it does really
well or you know you can also look at a

275
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,720
free alternative like branson which is
PHP and Perl

276
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,520
database backup all your considerations
to get but she didn't know any better

277
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,340
you can easily be spinning you know tens
of thousands of dollars on something

278
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:20,080
that just much bigger and scarier and
designed for much larger customers then

279
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:28,789
also other stuff is licensed by the
processor core the user and it pays to

280
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:33,240
really interrogated those vendors or
read through their licensing stuff he's

281
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,830
doing to find out what the best way to
buy it for you backup software and

282
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,908
archiving software classic for this they
often have a by the agents meaning like

283
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:50,770
to host as well as you know things like
exchange or sequel or or coal price but

284
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,940
they also have a by the termite price
and if you have allowed with a hundred

285
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,419
complex machine configurations now would
be you know hundreds of thousands of

286
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,720
dollars in licensing costs but if you
want in terms of data that might only be

287
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,750
a couple thousand dollars in licensing
costs if you purchase it the other way

288
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:14,549
but the only talking to your girl them
the only thing if you are in any way

289
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,640
conceivably and academic or nonprofit
like Microsoft is very generous deals

290
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,169
where it becomes competitor on something
like Microsoft applications sequel

291
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:30,169
datacenter edition Windows without

292
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,310
when there's no way I would have been
feasible and I five-person shop for

293
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:40,040
profit they have lessened since no one
to ten percent of the cost of commercial

294
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,659
if you're the right kind of customer and
if you are your self esteem the

295
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,040
professor Department they may already
how they like the licensing gets you

296
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,409
like MSDN educational or free lance
officer in a parade for anyone working

297
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:00,610
from the University it's it's going to
find out about the stuff you think about

298
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,879
when everybody things like laptops you
simply get OEM licensing we're getting

299
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,660
the plans of some kind you know that's
simply a license or like an OS that

300
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,420
locks to that specific hardware the
first thing I can anyone do after they d

301
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,460
crime fighter PC is to get all their
lessons in docs and PDFs and images

302
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:25,950
everything you take a individual clones
of all those laptops and network servers

303
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,950
whenever you get that maybe has a
configuration Jeremiah vendor you can

304
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,410
always I don't know how many people in
applying for reminding like laptops

305
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:40,510
because they broke windows and now they
just made using hardware or just because

306
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,950
you couldn't figure out how do you get a
legitimate copy of Windows again they

307
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:49,260
didn't call centre in the heart area so
getting professional imaging tools that

308
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,910
something to you if you don't have a lot
of time in nineteen apartment you don't

309
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:58,770
fix things at Amazon you just remake
them and there's no reason we can't be

310
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,629
doing that in our homes or small office
environments allowance if something's

311
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,980
broken if we have to spend more than
about 30 mins fixing we should just be

312
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:14,450
redeploying it sounds like a cloning or
about you imogene not going to like

313
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:21,530
puzzles great using it from a thumb
drive or from

314
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:29,600
media on Iran it is everything else for
anyone found that no matches to deliver

315
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
functionality

316
00:25:44,909 --> 00:26:00,169
did you guys get some other guy Jakubec
ok very good and these are some locals

317
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:07,330
callously hardware so we decide on a
powerful hardware we decided that

318
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:12,109
perhaps more stuff can be done on Linux
requires a real legit bona fide

319
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:17,658
Microsoft OS I don't think piracy is a
very good long-term strategy although it

320
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:23,379
sounds like we've got our stuff we've
got our our Pathak doubt we know what

321
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:25,439
we're gonna have to do on-site

322
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,789
next question your hardware what do we
do if we have a big budget we just call

323
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,919
it partially inventor and we were to
receive brand new 3G nine server as we

324
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,239
get you a new top of the line risk their
Cisco switch wireless guy came out and

325
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:44,690
stream so it plays smoothly mounted you
rumors whatever we like Cisco's but

326
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,119
since we don't really have that and you
know we kinda have to be a lil Scrappy

327
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:55,799
so the first thing I would argue is we
need to spend money where it counts and

328
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:01,220
where we can go cheap because it doesn't
really affect our lives she charges for

329
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,989
that so for small things like a network
or probably are going to cause long-term

330
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:08,359
misery if you don't do them right the
first time that means may be getting a

331
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:12,158
managed layer 3 switch from a reputable
vendor even if it's a four year old one

332
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:19,099
or maybe an outlier solution couple of
terms like after that so buying one or

333
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:20,230
two down from

334
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:25,580
the top of the line there may be a
solution you want things like Intel CPU

335
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,540
is a dramatic price point reduction when
you go a couple down from the top things

336
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:37,190
like networks which is when you start to
get away from the I can do BGP and sulk

337
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,320
or rounding in mediating simple balloons
there might be a stripped-down model

338
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,059
still from reputable vendor or their
strategy and getting something that

339
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,590
didn't turn out as the most expensive
pick out something one piece of

340
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,220
equipment but now for five years old man
said gigabit networking hasn't changed

341
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:00,340
much and you know we might just be fine
do not carry out some enterprise

342
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,500
software that tightly coupled to
hardware things like load balancers

343
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,980
network here

344
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,870
storage devices the fine print of how
this result may dictate that if the

345
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,649
hardware changes hands the lesson seen
as a little boy i'd rather than affects

346
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:19,440
you if it's a close personal testing lab
that might not ever have to get a

347
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,110
supporter hardware firmware update

348
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:28,010
done on its definitely wanted by you
enterprise hardware is also simply meant

349
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,770
to limit data center and it requires
care and feeding you know it has things

350
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:36,379
like loud fans and expects there to be
proper power and cooling and Iraq

351
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,120
environment so that might make some of
those things less attractive choice you

352
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,620
may be better off looking at the bottom
line products in a timely manner that's

353
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:55,080
made for small offices here and I'm
fired up when you get home it sucks you

354
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:03,860
probably have some now say dat ass like
an iCal a crack at the inside rails are

355
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:09,439
also exactly 19 inches and all the IKEA
lack of ground beef products and horny

356
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:18,870
no 48 ports are switching to another
strategy on come up with outliers

357
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,989
solutions so lets you have things like
the Netgear terms of $40 or firewalls

358
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,419
and goes to about $300 from their
enterprise grade in there less grumpy

359
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:36,830
version maybe the the lowest you know
Cisco assay is gonna start at $100 so

360
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,389
what I do in the middle

361
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,950
well it often comes down to

362
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:46,100
in there are some vendors out there are
some solutions hardware software open

363
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,350
source free whenever they're kind of
outliers perform much much better than

364
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,668
comparable solutions that cost more
money this is a classic thing like your

365
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,730
bicycle watching on you look at the
reviews and there are a whole bunch of

366
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:04,399
watches are pretty good and $50 and some
450 and then there's a couple watches

367
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,549
that are $60 seven thousand five star
reviews and all seemed legit you know

368
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,690
including some guy from the Swiss watch
live that said this outperformed you

369
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,710
know if he watches that we're ten times
the price and this is what we get the

370
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,929
lower scuba divers and our diamond
company ok well you know there are

371
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:26,500
things like that for whatever reasons
may be the the use the same software

372
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,409
stack of the same motherboard has the
ground super expensive model they've

373
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:36,019
been scaled down for a similar problem
maybe the solace to be able for their

374
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:40,090
corner but they wanted something similar
for their house in the store so they had

375
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,529
to deliver that well you kind of get to
take imagine that couple solutions that

376
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:53,210
you know where to now works they were
known for really expensive really robust

377
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,769
point-to-point microwave links you'd put
on towers will then they started taking

378
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:01,990
it down into smaller solutions you can
use to buy buildings together maybe a

379
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,600
few hundred meters and now they have a
whole line access points which is like

380
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,110
that but still has hardware watchdog and
the same for more staff and management

381
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:16,580
software as a big stuff which is kinda
cool stuff seems to work

382
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,750
surprisingly well and being less than
half the price

383
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,370
solutions that are in the enterprise
space the other way to look for stuff

384
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,439
like that look around and find stuff
that's deployed in thousands of

385
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,510
locations at Starbucks what our wireless
ISP sticking on the pole tops

386
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,150
closets they make their customers
provide for them you know when the

387
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,890
signal comes to building a house to get
down to find other floors solution

388
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:47,850
called mikrotik they make a hardware and
software router that runs on x86

389
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:54,020
hardware and they also make an embedded
solutions that can run on Linksys like

390
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,970
hardware just slips processor is a
little box and they're deployed in the

391
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:04,520
tens of thousands by wifi providers in
the day you really robust thing they

392
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,450
have no 95% of features that have ever
period and you know Linux or FreeBSD for

393
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:15,090
networking stuff traffic shaping and the
PM's and they happen to be available

394
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,090
apparently one of the reasons are male
sheep is that there are large customers

395
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,139
sort of get their stuff beta tested by
the small plants customers and so they

396
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,720
have kind of incentive to keep reminding
good products to the consumer market

397
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:37,560
pretty affordably another thing that's
ever happened to me like you never set

398
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:43,669
out to the server in jumping helm
striving for simplicity of the plan I

399
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:49,140
want to have internet wireless access
storage and maybe sticking up plan is

400
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,360
good idea it's so easy to get derailed
by shiny include technology that

401
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,189
utilizes better to just get you know
small functional feature complete core

402
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,260
of stuff done

403
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,160
problem take a break and then come back
to that a week or month later and decide

404
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:08,250
if I want to add more features that's
important and even a small environment

405
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,520
even if you have a sec is

406
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,590
you know two point of sale terminals
were allowed document everything as if

407
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,659
you were deploying a network for $10 and
servers you have to do that you know you

408
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,180
can spend just as much time
troubleshooting wired internet isn't

409
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,430
working as you do

410
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:28,200
troubleshooting the problem is costing
thousands of dollars an hour to climb

411
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,960
something also notice if you take the
time to learn the products and software

412
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,240
solutions you're going to play and you
know how to pack it up properly and

413
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,730
shutting down the store not properly and
you know you have it you can document

414
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:47,340
added your uptime with a cheap
environment is better than some new

415
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,590
house fully redundant faults on an
extensive environments that does not

416
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,250
know how to use them properly in fact
I'll argue that went down that highly

417
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,640
available solutions are dangerous if not
handled very carefully because that

418
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,050
complexity and interact with itself and
caused lots of difficult mysteries

419
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:11,090
things that take someone smarter than
the person who built it fix brakes fixed

420
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,399
by the dumbest guy with a hangover
Monday morning which is probably me as I

421
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:18,399
got it that's mean

422
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:34,780
I believe that important feature rather
than say I want to how something that

423
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:40,870
will prevent mistakes failures as I
wanna drop box around it and I want to

424
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:56,540
be able to quickly when I make a mistake
so you aren't answering to a question

425
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:03,000
you want me by we know we're smart we
know we can put things together we can

426
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,180
strip we can write code whatever but
buying really it's a time machine do we

427
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,580
have the time to do this do we need
support to someone other than myself

428
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,380
need to be able to own this after a walk
away when I want to Sunday do something

429
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,850
else with my life support this crappy
internet on coffee shop that I agreed to

430
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,690
help two years ago when was broken and
interchangeability who is there someone

431
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:33,740
other than me if I pick the most obscure
open source package and customized

432
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,229
instruct the helmet probably nobody but
me will ever be able to maintain it and

433
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:48,580
that's a way to not seen for a long time
now that being said Nuclear self

434
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:55,160
obviously you can save a lot of money to
yourself you leave investor time you

435
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,410
consulting team which might be really
something that may be onto cookie cutter

436
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,759
maybe this is a product you're building
a kiosk for malls and once you get the

437
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,270
recipe known you want to be able to
without a license burns or overhead

438
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:15,150
or whatever replicate this over and over
or for other offices I want to know

439
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,220
these things about the reason for that I
can fix anything I can train someone

440
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:25,549
else and I cannot lie I wanna have a
deep understanding I want to use a

441
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:32,740
particular piece of software and
hardware that is not exactly three times

442
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,080
in the Windsor because I want to
understand it I don't want to be able to

443
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,740
extend its functionality later I don't
need it and other things sustainability

444
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,270
consumer here even if it does eventually
all of them out and become obsolete

445
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:52,710
something like my filesystem a date on
it it's very concerning to me let's say

446
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:58,790
I D consumer now the bias and I want I
expect to be able to keep maintaining

447
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:06,650
and forward for 25 years around they
might very well

448
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:12,670
vendors change file systems data
recovery for counselors they lost

449
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:17,400
Indians and turns out this consumer now
some ice they were packing up to have

450
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,030
been upgraded three or four times and
every time the release new firmware the

451
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,870
new volumes came with totally different
file system types and layouts and

452
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:32,640
permissions and not only do I want to
meeting him something on Linux

453
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,569
open-source platform a worst case I can
call this file and I can compile this an

454
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,230
18 year olds

455
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,600
key piece of software that knows how to
read and from the sex adult while back

456
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,339
and text file if I ever needed to
reproduce it maybe that's important to

457
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:53,540
me that was a solution that just would
not be obtainable without great great

458
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,410
expense later but when they hear from
line four times not free I recommend you

459
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:04,310
come up with an hourly rate for your
time and you weigh that against mine it

460
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,590
if I can buy this for three dollars and
it's going to take two hours on time is

461
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,470
it worth it

462
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:39,770
maybe not but no peace I T Y you depend
on should ever be plugged directly into

463
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,590
the wall

464
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:45,890
lots of reasons and in power surges you
have just the fact that a lot of things

465
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,629
are not very friendly to being list for
a millisecond were minute you have down

466
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,400
time and you know things that don't
necessarily come up cleanly or well when

467
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,230
they've been glitch ups are expensive to
buy brand new nice ones but it turns out

468
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,530
there are those all ecosystems around
refurbishing recently sold like there's

469
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,470
a place in Southern California called
ups protection they will get you nicely

470
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:18,439
reformist you know a PC and consoles
sell its brand new batteries and like a

471
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,349
service contract for about how to pay
for 12 and leaving deliberate if you

472
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:26,670
want to do it yourself you can often
call around your clients and colleagues

473
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,670
and finance and anger that they were
gonna have to pay the way you can go get

474
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,609
boundaries from

475
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:38,930
like power source in Ontario rebuilding
ourselves and be up and running for a

476
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:45,319
few hundred bucks vs $6,000 for you may
be able to kill yes it's going to get

477
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:49,989
familiar with how to use this device
called a kilowatt thats kil kilowatt

478
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:54,170
designed for people who want to go to
solar power to find out how much

479
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:59,130
equipment here much power needs and
inside something that has some growth in

480
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,160
the runtime it's worth just doing
herself for hiring a re-election to put

481
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,410
in a couple dedicated circuits where you
put your equipment you really don't want

482
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,950
that sharing service the air conditioner
of which is using 80% capacity you know

483
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:22,919
when it's on causing something shutdown
racks and rocky road yeah you can put in

484
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,789
a bright track that works

485
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:29,319
baker's racks and Costco a proper rack
really is a nice things that you

486
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:34,359
wouldn't just to keep it clean and
orderly and easy to maintain and those

487
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,009
are expensive new good ones but they
also come up all the time since righty

488
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:44,069
then used in telecommunications their
use in medical tourism power plans and

489
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:52,569
even places any restaurant that has a
nice sound system are any home that

490
00:40:52,569 --> 00:41:00,269
house maybe equipment that are nice
women just fine so it's worth just

491
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:04,339
trolling Craigslist for a couple weeks
to find something nice or maybe looking

492
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:05,900
in something

493
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,780
you know that you can do local pickup
long does not work shipping those things

494
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,970
he is also nice proper rack power strips
you know those are worth it they have

495
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:20,720
much better than just a creamy power
supply list you know if you look at even

496
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,350
long enough to see interesting things I
saw a rack that was a complete deal

497
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:33,970
decertified skip so it was a fault that
grow lights and power cooling and data

498
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:42,290
transfer passengers and Jesse container
electronic locks on going to like $11

499
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,550
which is basically like this crown
princes I think it probably cost

500
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:49,790
$100,000 new so if you can figure out a
way to move the thing from the pickup

501
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:56,130
truck you can also get something a lot
nicer than you by if you think about it

502
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:01,280
you have a sufficiently want her to last
weekend when their commissions and you

503
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,200
can safely get away with just passively
clean it went to house more than hearing

504
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,299
loss in one place you have to think
about having relations minimum and

505
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,570
probably real air conditioning system
that's a whole other thing but keeping

506
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,910
things out of just being in the hot
little drawer will make them last longer

507
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:20,009
you know just putting a passive fan and
drilling some holes in the making the

508
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:26,580
counted Ustream invented accessories
little things like a malls in

509
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:32,509
record roundup I reckon maybe not why
not simply a pension just ordering two

510
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,940
or three times as many cables and all
links you need a prize for getting

511
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,370
better start from radar whatever is not
that expensive when you're buying you

512
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,569
know safety cables and wife of 20
because it's worth having

513
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,930
camels the right link you can label and
make nice m6 hardware is kind of

514
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:59,029
standard Oracle in my tracks that have
square holes they can do that was also

515
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:05,070
good way to put awkwardly size things in
may be physically robust environment put

516
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:11,320
stuff in you know we have still won is a
reliable file servers have you guys done

517
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:20,670
four tries at home

518
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:32,680
running CFS drive but it continued to
come along so I was only present I think

519
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:43,359
that's gonna make it past this now you
can share them so concerning my says

520
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:51,410
oftentimes or they have a very basic
rate 50 anything based on ZFS is going

521
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:59,330
to be automatically out of the gate very
very robust rights and really advanced

522
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,819
checks on the information that assumes
the hardware itself underlying

523
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:09,310
filesystem is untrustworthy and will
data and that's why you're able to do

524
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:13,700
that it probably had in the past
corrected other errors and a train set

525
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:22,950
never knew it and when one finally die
hard so that's not consider something

526
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:30,609
here for another time generally isn't
something else may or may not be very

527
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,950
kind to be in power

528
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,189
unexpectedly

529
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:39,569
or a firmware upgrade the doesn't go so
great is probably my go-to for almost

530
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:47,290
any small medium deployment now that we
know how long the money you saved you

531
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:54,230
Solaris or do you do with all the
goodness you get with something like

532
00:44:54,230 --> 00:45:04,670
that out some awful in an open source
file systems are now putting in place I

533
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,710
have a couple strategy that again when
you servers are miserable down your home

534
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:15,359
or small office so I recommend doing
something like putting to server or

535
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,680
larger shouting into the larger like
nineteen leader fans it's been slower I

536
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,310
recommend checking hardware
compatibility list for things like

537
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:28,799
FreeBSD and sold it to the letter like
not trying to make some bizarre ranging

538
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,030
from learn that you like to resent this
as a just and launched a bombing raid

539
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,390
unless it's done with a special form
where you can download one place on the

540
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:44,970
fast-moving right stick to what they say
six of the boot drives they say it's

541
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:48,368
fine don't try to make it work just
getting on the motherboard get another

542
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:54,390
server is this work I recommend for
drive configuration is kinda sweet spot

543
00:45:54,390 --> 00:46:01,078
like 14 terabyte drives dual core
processor perhaps a small high right

544
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:09,430
around / for the times and the company's
reports anything about four sound across

545
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:18,960
tribes I recommend you go to parity
drives it looks like an apple or a nice

546
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:28,339
network file error that was the last
five years really 0:23 Brockers baseman

547
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:33,170
got one of the doubt chain systems for
drives and then we have a 16 big

548
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:38,520
expansions and its chassis for it
underneath a couple of VMware servers

549
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,050
and then one of the

550
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:44,690
UPS's from UPS protection and it seemed
like a plan around that was made for EV

551
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:52,430
in or straight if you are going to a
larger considered as getting a bigger

552
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,240
chance even hold it arrives internally
considered getting something you can add

553
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,700
around too often gets more interior and
systems get more space in front or just

554
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:09,460
dealing with the motherboard that takes
whenever I don't like a reverse now it's

555
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:14,490
expensive down and then systems get me
to 5 years old is really expensive again

556
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:20,259
you're always better off getting round
to filers until you max out around

557
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:27,180
another thing if you have implications
of all the things that the hypervisor

558
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:33,970
get around things like Prince services
you mean like any kind of security

559
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:35,549
network

560
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:41,340
logging lagos goings p.m. no problem
trying to pick stuff that runs on Linux

561
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,660
even how the licensing over and over
again and again

562
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,710
pick something like a desktop John C
Lincoln County Extension there was a

563
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:57,110
couple years old or newer bigger to
minimize the noise that course which by

564
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:01,690
a good managed layer 3 capable one or
two gigs which depend on your

565
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,850
preferences

566
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:09,170
Cisco stuff you know kind of house this
alert everybody still on one time or

567
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:14,330
another in their career in turns out
there are other top-shelf vendors like

568
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:19,870
arrested in extreme pain and when their
stuff it's oftentimes launching

569
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:25,930
Francisco respect for the same Aaron
vintage I would recommend getting there

570
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:30,520
383 VLANs by now and so forth

571
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:36,220
even if you don't think that'll help you
along with retaliation security stuff

572
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:42,509
when he later and there are some other
grounds that you're not buying me to the

573
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:47,840
top of the line of the lesser stuff
telepresence which is the only call I

574
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,770
can't believe it's not IRS

575
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,670
Housing Finance which is designed to put
out for their

576
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:02,490
and surprisingly good images and East
switches which come if it's one of the

577
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:08,049
smaller and switches with a lifetime
warranty no questions asked for 65 bucks

578
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,160
they were great

579
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:19,180
Wireless you can use your place in about
cetera but I think you're one of those

580
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,069
outliers especially cuz they come with a
really nice free management out the long

581
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:28,110
run in Windows or Linux p.m. just very
very good reliability and

582
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:32,420
price-performance they give you this
nice web based you either works under

583
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:38,850
Linux news etc for client sleepies all
the stuff you would do an enterprise

584
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,819
environment

585
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,110
lasting firewalls I know this is a very
personal topic to people here i think im

586
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:50,190
not a proxy or the Middle East consider
for home small office some strategies

587
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:57,380
you can have a look and only 90 likes it
or not BC you can put in something like

588
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:02,290
a mikrotik RouterBOARD its nice little
embedded hardware software solution is

589
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:08,750
there something like consumer with like
didi open wrt or to meet him to get you

590
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:14,970
command line and enterprise features a
lot like Halloween and stuff I think

591
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,959
you're best off picking something in
learning it really well and sticking to

592
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:26,750
replicate this mikrotik also has a nice
win during to you as long as the Sealion

593
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:33,820
web so that's one thing that i think is
probably most difficult thing to say

594
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:41,040
that she is back up is missing them back
up and the backstop to security storage

595
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,850
other problems in my house I think you
always need to have a company don't room

596
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:52,368
and some kind of her native thats
offline and not learning environment can

597
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:56,770
be backed into a cloud service like
crash-landed easily machine

598
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:06,450
well things like servers and server data
packets jewels are saying there are

599
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:10,480
services that will just give you a pain
or seeing account like are sometimes you

600
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,200
can are seeing right things with scripts
off site you can also hear something

601
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,439
locally to build a second free now I
mean solution if you how hundreds of

602
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,680
terabytes of data a wedding photos or
video or something you professionally

603
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,410
you're not gonna get down into a fully

604
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:31,509
Iron Mountain managed care plan but you
might be able to get that at least a

605
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,940
second one another room that would be a
big step up and take it off site and

606
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,830
leave it somewhere

607
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:44,069
the last thing the stuff that's a lot of
money on things like signage digital

608
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:50,320
security there are some nice embedded
solutions and other kinds were cheap

609
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:59,330
software hardware there's a digital
emotions of any dumb television with

610
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:04,319
HDMI port and raspberry pie duct taped
to the back into complete digital

611
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:10,450
signage solution and there's 45 other
ones the open source security solution

612
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,810
we built a 23 be

613
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:17,070
completes lady and learn system that's
all based on

614
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:23,050
of it that's something that if you're
running your hands dirty you can

615
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:28,420
customize something locally well for you
and the last thing you know what time

616
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,970
you can't afford for me and contracting
tha what you can do things like me be

617
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:37,680
purchased two of the thing you're using
eBay used one as a loud and Deb system

618
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,440
will make a change in either in
production typical spirit of anything

619
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,970
you're going to use even simple

620
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:50,120
reference concedes the normal don't plan
way that's shown in the forums and the

621
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:57,080
Orioles and you know take advantage of
all the rituals of interest house and

622
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,640
the key is to keep the box so I don't
wanna be down for three days down for

623
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,980
dinner if I standardizing keep it simple
I can find those up and when someone

624
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:13,660
dies I just thrown out and putting it on
in settings and everything backed up I

625
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:19,299
have my stuff and it's not a big deal I
just want to cry in a corner at work

626
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:28,090
constantly links up here and you can
download the presentation here for a

627
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:35,480
couple questions you missed the reaction
cover story

628
00:53:41,590 --> 00:54:45,510
any other questions you want clean and
sales solutions to live a destra that's

629
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:48,200
the only way to go I think we're out of
time

630
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:48,899
thank you very much
