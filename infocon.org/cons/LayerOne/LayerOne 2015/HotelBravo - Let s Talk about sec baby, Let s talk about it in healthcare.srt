years now and doing it a major health
care institutions obligatory disclaimer

16
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,020

you are lazy and the program then here's

21
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:58,490
what's going on but i wanna talk about
and high-tech how will screen Phai how

22
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,059
much does it cost for stolen record who
wants it

23
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,100
you know what's it worth everything
going out and about biotech devices

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,789
scary shit that we all see all the time
but don't pay attention to and at the

25
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,799
end we're gonna talk about little bit of
hope we can do in the future to maybe

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,160
fix a lot of the ship so high tech for
those who don't know if it was enacted

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,530
in August 21st 1996 to cut back on waste
and abuse and health care does not

28
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:45,590
really work very well yes it's also an
availability of medical records for

29
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,950
patients and provide privacy guidelines
for those records high-tech was an

30
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,959
amendment to the President Obama's
stimulus package is no 9 it was designed

31
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,010
to give him more teeth and it does give
it quite a bit of cheese because for the

32
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,590
most part

33
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:12,500
HIPAA Sox so how much more teeth this is
a news clip of a news article from it so

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:20,500
apparently in alaska mental health
facility facility got fine $156,000 for

35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,820
failing $150,000 for failing to
safeguard patient data that's what they

36
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,549
say and this is just for the settlement
this wasn't the initial fine this is

37
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,600
what they said aloud in court the reason
for this was because they were running

38
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:43,709
Windows XP so OCR came in and said hey
you have a bunch of unpatched systems

39
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,540
out there that don't receive patches
anymore you also didn't sign up for

40
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,540
Microsoft CEO extended service that's
fine

41
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,510
and a little bit about it so by law if
you know if you lose more than 500 or

42
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,989
more records for people you have to
report to the press you don't have an

43
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,920
option in it you have to report it and
the press doesn't really get anything

44
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,269
wrong i mean look at you know of
anything right now let's talk about that

45
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:21,000
as dirty sons of the Chequers Inn yeah
thank you for the picture so let's talk

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,050
about the big moneymaker pH I so for
those who don't know still in thi health

47
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,200
records can go from anywhere from $7 a
pop to about a hundred bucks can go even

48
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,889
more kids records you know kids don't
check their credit history or anything

49
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,490
like that but it all depends on the
record the source and information on it

50
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,350
so like is saying you know mental health
care facility you know the doctor's note

51
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,150
about pay my patient is clinically
depressed that doesn't really go for a

52
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,890
lot though if the patient high-profile
patient but it all depends on the source

53
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:07,729
you know what's on the record so why
does everybody knows you know tax fraud

54
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,140
everything you know because the health
record has your social security number

55
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,860
date of birth address height weight age
blood type anything part in your health

56
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,400
history that you gave to the doctor or
patient health record has that already

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,909
down and stored digitally health records
got it I mean and people are taking the

58
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,700
stuff we just had their first marriage
as happened what was it like to 3 days

59
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,940
ago its gold these guys are staking the
ship and they're doing all sorts of you

60
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,219
know tax fraud you know and I do that
it's it's great and the thing is we are

61
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,250
not like number of you try to change
that I'll take about a year two years to

62
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:57,400
fix so now let's talk about in the long
for a while now who's gonna cost you the

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,659
most money right now if you work in a
hospital who's gonna be the one that's

64
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,050
gonna screw you over the most

65
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:13,840
does your doctor is full of fail doctors
generally have this idea in their heads

66
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:22,810
that digital record is not equivalent to
a paper record so you will have cases of

67
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,840
doctors

68
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,258
downloading six seven thousand thousand
different patient health records all

69
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,270
their patients all legitimate access
they all have complete legitimate access

70
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,378
to the stuff downloaded to their laptop

71
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:41,900
walking outside of the hospital and then
the laptop got stolen or they so I mean

72
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,299
that's a big problem and you know if
it's unencrypted then you have to report

73
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,940
it as a breach and if you've reported as
a bridge and OCR comes in they're gonna

74
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,759
find the ship is going to cost you a lot
of money so your doctor you gotta watch

75
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,319
him and you know owner same thing goes
for nurses to nurses have access to

76
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,219
these patient health records they will
do the same thing they will download it

77
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:08,120
because I just want to help out the
doctor with his research in you know

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,400
obesity whatever they'll take it all
downloaded to lose it it's so noticed

79
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,068
you want to protect yourself at least
really just encrypt everything doesn't

80
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,169
matter what it is

81
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:25,740
encrypt it I'm not taking a shot

82
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:36,170
so the best is yet to come ok do anybody
know who these people are and you there

83
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:42,530
ok so some of you know those who don't
know these are the people who actually

84
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,340
store your health records for hospitals
don't really story there they go to

85
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,640
these information services providers or
whatever to start all there and you know

86
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:05,599
these guys are the ones who hold your
records and they suck they make money

87
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,890
not based on how good their software is
or how good they protect your data they

88
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,630
make their money based off of how much
it's going to cost you to get rid of

89
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,870
them they go through the mccarthy
approach to get themselves in the

90
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,710
attached themselves to your network and
then they say well you wanna get rid of

91
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,419
us well that's going to cost you you
know a million dollars to get rid of us

92
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,520
and you know that's not good at that and
you're like well it's gonna cost me

93
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,539
million get rid of them and I'm not
really gonna save all that money so I'll

94
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,510
just keep them around and their security
is absolutely terrible I've had people

95
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,620
you know from different companies have
done you know done engagements against

96
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,370
these guys in there say they're
absolutely horrible it's a mystery why

97
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:55,930
there hasn't been a bigger breach then
you know right so now we're gonna go

98
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,189
into

99
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,420
of the scary shit that happens out there
were gonna talk about some of the biomed

100
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,420
devices

101
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,400
biomed devices pretty much from
pacemakers to infusion pumps all this

102
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,240
stuff is network and it doesn't have any
type of real security standards on there

103
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,550
i mean we remember Barnaby Jack talk
about hacking wireless pacemaker and you

104
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,660
know that was a lot of fun but for the
most part stuff like that has really

105
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,640
changed you know nobody wants to change
it because there's no real benefit into

106
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:38,640
changing it really doesn't have any
rules when it comes to security in

107
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,180
BioMed devices they there's no
regulation there's no there's nothing

108
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,170
they should stay here a couple of
guidelines that we want you to follow

109
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:52,050
but that's not a deal breaker for us you
know well still you know sign off your

110
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,260
crappy infusion pump out there and let
you sell it to mom and pop you know

111
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:05,220
hospital or whatever who cares it's just
recommendations and the FDA really

112
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,110
doesn't say anything and this all these
recommendations and everything will only

113
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,860
apply to stuff that's about to come out
of the market or stuff that's already

114
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:23,180
going through FDA approval so you will
have and this is not uncommon biomed

115
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,120
devices that probably been sitting in
your hospital for ten fifteen years and

116
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,590
the hospital does not get rid of it
because it costs too much money or they

117
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,700
want to get rid of it but the clinician
is like hey I don't wanna get rid of it

118
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,490
I'm used to seeing this device or
sometimes even clinicians when they

119
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,280
change hospitals by the freakin device
themselves and take it with them to

120
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,100
another hospital simply because they're
used to it works on cutting out

121
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,260
but yeah they'll just keep it and take
it to other places and then they just

122
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,600
plugged into the network says you know I
want to be able to you know reached all

123
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,810
these patients and see how they're all
doing from the comfort of the golf

124
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:27,520
course you know and they security is
reckless and it was you I know is you so

125
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,120
I don't know if any of you see the
saudis TV they got published last week

126
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:44,460
so there was a device that had poor 2300
pin no authentication at all and you got

127
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:53,500
root shell yeah that's not uncommon and
also this fix they're not going to be

128
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:00,580
able to really fix this so you want to
kill somebody just look up the CD you

129
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,940
can probably find some of these devices
but yeah it's it's it's not good because

130
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,770
government sucks when it comes to
regulation when it comes to regulation

131
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:16,770
so for all the old devices out there any
major patches any major software changes

132
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:23,329
to any type of device has to go back
through full FDA approval you can you

133
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:29,140
know a cycle which will take about two
years just to get the room which is why

134
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,830
you have instances of hospital still
running XP because they have no choice

135
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,740
they have to wait for the manufacturer
to come out with something that can run

136
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,550
on a Windows 7 or Windows 8 device you
know they have to wait as these guys

137
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,359
have to wait for the FDA to say yes or
no and if the FDA says no and they have

138
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,240
to get you know recreate the software
again and then send it back to the FDA

139
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,960
and wait another two three years just to
get this proved it's a pain in the ass

140
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,700
minor hotfixes though I do some minor
bug changes and things like that that

141
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,670
stuff will get approved in a couple of
months

142
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,550
weeks maybe depending on you know what
you're changing what you're doing but

143
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:19,319
major stuff has to go through full FDA
approval and it's it's a nightmare

144
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,150
anybody who works in BioMed field knows
that getting stuff for the FDA is a pain

145
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:31,329
in the ass so let's think about the
scary future ahead of us because of all

146
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,820
these problems so we're gonna go a
little bit into the just a little bit

147
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,240
imaginate you know imaginations we're
not going to be too far off of what

148
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,850
could possibly happen but you know this
is kinda think about this so things are

149
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,650
pretty scary I don't know if anybody saw
that last year in a poll gave a talk at

150
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:56,260
some police security conference or
whatever and they say that the world's

151
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,189
first cyber murder

152
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,720
gonna happen in 2015 I'm honestly
surprised it hasn't happened yet it

153
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,020
probably has just nobody said anything
orders just probably no way to detect it

154
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,439
actually happened so when this happens
you're gonna have to call in these guys

155
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,300
CSI cyber yeah because they're gonna get
all the Sabres and solve all your cyber

156
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:28,199
crimes and don't cause for being so yeah
let's use our imagination

157
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:49,569
I love you to your my one and only one
alright so let's use our imagination

158
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:55,410
just for a little bit when it comes to
biomed devices so you know a lot of us

159
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,160
in this field we know like criminals
they're only gonna go after profit so

160
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,480
yeah we like to say about hey we can
kill people and that's awesome in all

161
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,779
but you know is the criminal really
gonna bother to actually do anything

162
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:12,810
about it so I just think about this
let's say you in fact 10 infusion pumps

163
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:19,819
30 40 maybe and you got you can do
anything you want with them right who

164
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,850
cares right you know I'm not get any
profit then let's just do this but if I

165
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:33,760
in fact forty fusion pumps to senior
hospital staff hey I've infected these

166
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,500
machines infected this number machines
to tell you which ones but I got them if

167
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,860
you don't pay me $1,000,000 gonna start
killing people one by one

168
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:53,200
crazy but that's kind of like a locker
right around somewhere you know it

169
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,150
exists and it's the same thing you know
we're just taking the whole concept of I

170
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,860
have all your very very valuable
information encrypted and I'm not gonna

171
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,220
give you the key you know X amount of
money we're just translating it to Milan

172
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,190
devices saying I've now infected all
your machines if you don't pay me I'm

173
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,400
gonna start killing people and then
you're gonna have to explain to the

174
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,620
press and to all of you know the
patients families hey I didn't want to

175
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,089
pay a million dollars so that's why your
pet you know your mother your husband

176
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:31,950
your wife your kids are dead thats yeah
crazy room right so there's kind of hope

177
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,950
for this whole thing so you guys

178
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:42,570
should come to the dark side I know
banks pay more money than anything

179
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:51,000
hospitals in a pay you just the way it
works is because for the most part they

180
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,820
don't need us

181
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,649
hospitals I've had clinton you know the
nation's come to me all the time and

182
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,680
they make it very clear to me we don't
need I T and you know I T makes things

183
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,790
easier for us and faster for us and
allows us to deal with more patients but

184
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,049
a lot you know when it comes down to it
we don't need I T

185
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,780
you know we can take care of the patient
with you know rubber tubing and syringes

186
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:25,350
we can go back down to that so you know
but you know I T and you know we help

187
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:31,719
them keep things running but the whole
concept of information security with

188
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:41,540
healthcare is very very new for the most
part most hospitals did not have InfoSec

189
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,530
department and if they did it was just
one guy who said no to everything and

190
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:54,360
got overruled all the time so he was
just kind of a figurehead to say yes we

191
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,360
have an infant department it's just this
day

192
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,610
but thank you anthem hospitals and
health care providers are running

193
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,300
crazily scared they are throwing money
at Investec it's amazing how much money

194
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,500
they're just here you go

195
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:20,560
just protect us tell us everything's
gonna be ok but they're looking for

196
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,139
answers but they don't know where to go
to and there are larger charlatans out

197
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,650
there you all know them that are going
to you know promise you this big magical

198
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,980
box that's going to solve all your
security problems and they will fall for

199
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:41,110
it a lot of these people they are in
that scared they will take anything but

200
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,439
you all can shape the competition to how
it goes in its infancy we can actually

201
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:55,090
set a lot of the rules and policies that
allow the rules and policies regarding

202
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,510
healthcare in InfoSec so I mean a lot of
people say you know dealing with

203
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:08,100
clinicians and doctors or whatever a
pain in the ass and yes it is but no

204
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,350
answers just got a you know shave shower
for a bit I know it's kind of hard for

205
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,879
some of you to even do some of those
things put on a clean bunch shirts made

206
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,820
yourself semi presentable actually make
yourself fully presentable for crying

207
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,320
out loud

208
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,860
not hard and leave that big giant ego at
the door because if you think you have a

209
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:36,300
big ego doctors got a mere one because
hey I save lives

210
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,740
you just type on a computer all day but
I save lives

211
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:48,780
I went to a doctor a friend deal with a
with a doctor who she wanted local

212
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:55,190
administrator privileges on her machine
so she full-on went if you don't give

213
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,600
this to me I'm gonna quit and if I quit
who's gonna take care of the patients

214
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:09,820
well she didn't get it and she also
didn't quit so but no doctors you know

215
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,460
they have to detach themselves from the
patient they can't cells they can't get

216
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,330
themselves emotionally involved with
patients because if you get it yourself

217
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,949
emotionally involved with patient you're
not going to survive so but some of them

218
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,220
take that to a very extreme where they
just think as patient as machines in

219
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,690
something to just be topless so don't
even bother trying to fight the doctor

220
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,690
just try to understand their position

221
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,580
give them data give them facts there are
more open to fax and data than anybody I

222
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:46,530
seen because in the end their their
scientists they get it but yeah you show

223
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:50,420
them evidence they'll change its gonna
take awhile it's going to be at a

224
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:57,930
snail's pace but things will change you
know we have a way to do this we just

225
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,460
gotta put the work into it so that's all
I got

226
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:11,660
thank you and enjoy the next talk unless
anybody anybody anything yes rack give

227
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,160
me a standing ovation ok well yeah enjoy
the next time

228
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:37,660
you have a question I'm not short I'm
vertically challenged I mean I only have

229
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:45,870
half an hour here i mean you have
anything to add Chris or or you know the

230
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:57,040
line somewhere else that's what I
thought anything else anybody have

231
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:10,750
anything constructive to say comment yes
my mommy says next year again anything

232
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,000
any constructive criticism or anything
that you want to add a not about how

233
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
young I look or how short I am I get it
I'm young I'm short let's move on

234
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:28,950
alright alright alright I'll drink to
that

235
00:22:31,720 --> 00:23:18,500
yes yes it this way if you have the
lawyers you can get away with anything

236
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:48,980
you just have to get the company's
liability but your name is still going

237
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,830
in the paper and that's gonna get going
to cost you the most money it's not the

238
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,870
fact that you have to pay all these
people for you know credit monitoring or

239
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,590
anything like that it's the fact that
your name is in the paper and if you are

240
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:17,850
a large hospital that relies heavily on
donations you're screwed so yes I do

241
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:31,780
your hand right here on capitol
Australia see how the individual you are

242
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:38,540
you were at the mercy of person who's
holding the knife and the place where

243
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,330
you're at so for the most part no can't
really anything you can protect yourself

244
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,929
because you can ask to have your patient
records removed and probably process

245
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:54,600
that in a year that anything else

246
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:06,510
it would all depend on the information
on there like a transcript or whatever

247
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:11,379
if it's you know if somebody really
wants it then you can be about 7 10

248
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,370
bucks or whatever that just a transcript
of some type of like procedure that's

249
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,408
usually chief

250
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:27,399
the stuff that gets you know 250 $20 is
the full patient record time thank you

251
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:27,719
very much
