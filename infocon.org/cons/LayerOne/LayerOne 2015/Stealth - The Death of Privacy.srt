1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,470
stuff yeah I know I want it sits right
next to you guys build more crappy

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,830
robots to be my crappy robots are crappy
are about to lose my crappy robot that's

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:18,109
fine with me to otherwise outside this
is the last call for tee shirts at the

4
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,000
registration table so if you want a
t-shirt head out there before we start

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,750
packing them up

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,250
same goes for the hacker stickers vendor
booths and the media archives video

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,070
cable so if you want any talk it's $5 if
you want the whole conference it's $40

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:40,540
and they have it all on DVD outside
after this talk we're gonna have closing

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,600
ceremonies in this room pretty much as
soon as he's done I'm gonna throw him

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,710
off stage following my laptop and then
we're gonna run through that real quick

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,070
they want to sell here by 5:30 at the
latest and then after that you are

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,949
welcome to join us at the 23 be after
party if you need the address go to shop

13
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:06,720
. 23 be dot org and and we'll see you
there until then we have stuck with the

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,789
death of privacy

15
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:17,600
just a moment to get the technical
aspects of the picture on the screen we

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
write with you

17
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:36,040
layer one this year hopefully is worth
the wait

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,010
so alright well see little bit about me
I'm spend most my life fiddling with

19
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,630
computers and taking she departs the
other worked and more recently I do

20
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:54,009
information security work I do a lot of
special investigations into financial

21
00:01:54,009 --> 00:02:00,340
crimes fraud just like school property
theft all that fun stuff and along the

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,369
way I've got a few ideas I want to do
this talk because privacy is really an

23
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:10,758
issue and I believe that was not get any
better and certainly a lot of the talks

24
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:17,190
we can have talked about that so how do
you get this bad and what can you do to

25
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,829
get some of your best some years back so
here we go

26
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:28,650
whatever the definition so down here for
the purpose of this talk privacy is the

27
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,420
personally identifiable information
private thoughts beliefs and intimate

28
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,280
details of our lives which we share
which we wish to control but how and

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,720
with whom they are shared so that should
set the tone for him where things are

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:49,010
going so in this country in in america
from even before the United States what

31
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,828
was it the pilgrims came here and it
wasn't just have turkey dinner with the

32
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:55,350
indians it was because they were
escaping religious persecution they

33
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,750
wanted their right to self-determination
ok yours went on we start to form a

34
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,820
country and write the Constitution
Declaration of Independence all that

35
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,970
stuff but most people don't realize the
privacy is not specifically guaranteed

36
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:16,209
by the Constitution shocked bill rights
however first ten amendments in the

37
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,370
Constitution the Bill are known as the
Bill of Rights collectively and that's

38
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,060
where we really get these rights for for
privacy the right to not know illegal

39
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,060
search and seizure right to arm bears

40
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,480
the important stuff okay so but
obviously things have happened in recent

41
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,209
years it's gone down in things have been
changed people react people get scared

42
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,840
they do things that maybe they wouldn't
otherwise do and that's changed the

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,310
whole landscape we're talking 911 and
forward in fact I remember a

44
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:56,260
conversation with a TSA agent who said
the expectations of privacy have changed

45
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,140
substantially since 911 think it will
not for me I still think we deserve

46
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,619
privacy but not everyone has the same
picture what that might be so you have

47
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,730
to kind of measure the needs and with
our rights so so we don't make too many

48
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,649
mistakes here let's talk about a lot of
the laws have been put into place

49
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:22,650
because of these events and that's part
of what we're dealing with ok so why

50
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,340
would I would call legal threats to
privacy Patriot Act and extensions the

51
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,719
act in fact that's up this weekend
they're trying to extend that without

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,090
reading it too quickly

53
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,219
National Security Letters you always see
you all know about those if you get one

54
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,120
you have to do it but you can't tell
anyone doesn't seem to write postal

55
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,400
covers here's a good one

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,849
you know the post office photographs
your mail and packages on the front and

57
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:50,250
the back and this was started because
the anthrax scare you know setting

58
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,320
powder poison through the mail and they
figured we need to be able to track this

59
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,000
they put this plan into place attracts
those kind of gone away but it's still

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,030
there so there's a lot of things that
seem to have a life beyond their need

61
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,340
for a and stingray Big Data these are
all things that can affect our privacy

62
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:15,219
and in different ways about the not so
legal threats that's out there to you

63
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,000
all heard about possibly the RSA deal
where they sold the back door to their

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,760
encryption priceless 10 million I'm sure
they've made their money back

65
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,109
you've got organizations that sell 0 day
to the highest bidder or anybody that's

66
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,229
got the money

67
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:36,110
fraud schemes nation state-funded just
cyber criminal organizations a lot of

68
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,780
bad things out there and we talked about
some of those here

69
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,340
you know during this week so what about
the legal issues training there's also

70
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,549
things going on trying to fight these
Microsoft is currently in a battle in

71
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,650
Ireland trying to get access to a server
there that has data on it that pertains

72
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,700
to a USA citizen in a fight is that if
they're allowed to go there and get that

73
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,479
from another country and what's inside
the other country from Sandwell we've

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,990
got some citizens that you've got their
data and we need to get access to that

75
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,990
as well so kind of a slippery slope on a
lot of these things

76
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:17,570
the UK just got granted immunity for
doing things that we would sign find

77
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,630
distasteful although Europe has
generally better privacy laws and we do

78
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,969
there are still things that are not
perfect and there certainly countries

79
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,110
requiring their vendors or you know
service providers to provide back doors

80
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,400
into things so that they can spy on
their citizens and do other things to

81
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,150
protect themselves from themselves or
something so heinous a math

82
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,289
data-gathering we've we've certainly
heard a lot about that Australia just

83
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,950
joined into the Patriot Act idea they
just passed recently the in the past

84
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,860
couple weeks our own version of that so
they'll be having their own set of

85
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,820
problems there as a result ok so what we
need to do here

86
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,580
well you need to know who your adversary
as you need to be able to determine your

87
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,280
valley to them what do you have that
they want ok how do you protect that

88
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,739
what's it cost what it costs if we don't
protect it

89
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,180
ok and so in thinking about this I got
here thinking about this I'm trying to

90
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,039
put together a plan now the idea behind
this talk is is not solve all the

91
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,630
problems of the world but to create a
plan of actionable items that you guys

92
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,940
can follow who are the people that
you're interested in protecting can

93
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,250
follow and be in a better position than
you were today

94
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,570
ok we can solve all the problems but
we're going to kind of go for the ones

95
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,849
that we can make a difference

96
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:44,580
ok so you want to have a have a list of
your assets you want to know what your

97
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,469
tangible assets are as well as your
intangible assets of these may include

98
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,220
things that you have more things that
you have control of or things that you

99
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,770
control

100
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,530
or have access for others like maybe
your job you have certain assets there

101
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,789
that you are responsible for and it may
be possible that someone trying to get

102
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:04,729
to those is gonna try to get through you
to get to that ok social engineering is

103
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,389
is the new attack I mean it's not really
new attack but it's become more and more

104
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,849
useful in the types of blended attacks
that we see today going after

105
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,599
corporations and individuals so what the
heck PC worth

106
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,470
there's so many things I can do with it
let me count the ways this is not an

107
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,169
exhaustive list but I think it
illustrates the idea that there are many

108
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:34,039
opportunities we have they control your
PC they can do many many bad things ok

109
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,319
and a lot of the talks here we talked
about how to protect that we talked

110
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,020
about here is a new zero day or what
have you but the point here is that you

111
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,970
have a lot of potential attack vectors
to take care of so how do you do that

112
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,060
this seems like an almost insurmountable
problem in some cases

113
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,060
well one thing you know where the
research coming from K

114
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,649
cameras cyber criminal gangs
professional fraudsters social network

115
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,560
system risk they're infected media we've
all heard the stories lately but some

116
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,329
drive out somewhere hoping some
employers take it and plugging into the

117
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:11,459
corporate network big data and course if
that's not enough we also have the new

118
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:18,699
threat the internet sim news and I know
things are things means security was an

119
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,670
afterthought basically if I can connect
to it I own it this is a lot of

120
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,699
implications they will have to ask Chris
Rogers about this particular slide

121
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:34,020
anyway so when these things happen
there's a cost to it so it's not just

122
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,960
the loss it's the how do I put myself
back and make myself whole again when I

123
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,750
started to look at

124
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,860
I'm trying to apply this to the
individual and my feeling is that maybe

125
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,520
there's some things in the assessment
work in the security work that we've

126
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,360
done with corporation that runs in
perilous here we can we get some lessons

127
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,640
from that we can bring this down to the
individual level and we can make

128
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,330
individuals and the people that we care
about protecting a hard target the

129
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:06,839
purpose of this is to make you harder
target hardening the individual so you

130
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,630
need to know what you have a value who
you are

131
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,939
match the assets massive protection of
the level of assets you have backup

132
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,800
plans and other methods to recovery they
should be verifiable that should be

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:30,319
tested you should know they're going to
work instead of gas so I just like this

134
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:38,390
idea so in looking at some commonalities
been corporations and individuals one of

135
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,459
the biggest fears corporations have his
workplace violence the thought that some

136
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,020
employer some individual will have a bad
day get fired go home come back with a

137
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,800
gun in go postal on the place where some
kid broke up with his girlfriend comes

138
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,349
back to school and wants to make revenge
individual said the same thing getting

139
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,410
mugged get beat up whatever we have
physical years of things that were

140
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,810
concerned about that kind of parallel
there

141
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:09,550
sincere financial loss account takeovers
as big damage the brand similar to

142
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,290
identity theft intellectual property
that should be our personal information

143
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,770
morale impacts on that internal bad guys
fraud losses are all things that are

144
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,589
parallels to what corporations worried
about what we also worried about now the

145
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,230
problem is with the corporation they
have kind of a let's say they've got a

146
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,360
building they've got security out front
reception so whatever they've got

147
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,980
somewhat controlled environment to deal
with whereas individuals we're we move

148
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,290
around a lot of places we do a lot of
different things we carry are you know

149
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,069
we carry our digital devices with us so
we have a lot of different things to

150
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:48,060
consider how do we manage to do this
well thinking about this I feel it's a

151
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,410
complex problem but as any complex
problem you want to try to break that

152
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,610
down into smaller pieces that are more
manageable and those in smaller pieces

153
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,770
that you can actually do something about
it so what I've done is that come up

154
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,350
with what I call framework for a
foundation for personal security and

155
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,990
risk management and really when you
think about security it's really all

156
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,280
about managing risk so he can cut that
back and do a better job that more

157
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,780
secure so that looks like this these are
the cornerstones for the personal risk

158
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:25,010
management they are data security
identity and reputation as soon include

159
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,270
identity fraud and things of that nature

160
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:34,930
your financial assets and of course
physical or later one so what we do here

161
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,630
ok let's take them one by one and kind
of drill down and what i'm what i'm

162
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,260
proposing is these are things that
anybody can do you may be doing a number

163
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,410
of them you may have I may have some
different views on a few of them but at

164
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,750
the time a process that security is not
a product into process and if you or

165
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,650
your loved ones are people you want to
protect go through this process you

166
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,030
should be better off than when you
started so I want to establish at least

167
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,339
a baseline and that's what this is about

168
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,270
so let's talk about data security you've
got a computer got stuff on it you don't

169
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,740
wanna lose what's the one thing what's
the most important thing you could do to

170
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,800
make sure that doesn't happen this is
the audience participation time raising

171
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,079
hand

172
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,510
backup dealing with an intelligent group
here

173
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,180
great that's right back up procedures
are very important even if not connected

174
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,489
the internet if it's in the closet
somewhere back it up you can see it

175
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,450
ok but there's other things we need to
be concerned about malware networks

176
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,940
browsers and other network aware
applications and I think I call the

177
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,780
password or account security audit and
we'll get into this and more details we

178
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,120
go on but let's just look at let's start
with each one and see if we've got a few

179
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,110
insights here ok backup to an external
hard drive this should be obvious ride

180
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,730
on a hard drive should not be kept next
to the computer it should be later

181
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,170
stored somewhere away because the two
biggest disasters are typically floods

182
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,240
and fire and if it if it burns up for
the firemen come in and they close the

183
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,080
place down and you waste your backup you
got a problem so that should be separate

184
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,240
most of us already know that there's
another thing that i think is important

185
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,160
in this is gonna come into play for the
recovery portion make a mirror image of

186
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,620
the system and by that I mean you want
the Virgin image of when the OS was put

187
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,800
together you put the applications on it
you know none of your personal user data

188
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,130
but a basic running system ready to go
with the things that you need and you

189
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,260
have a mirror image of that so that if
if you need to replace the one you have

190
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,390
you can pull this one out

191
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,540
plug that went in and you're gonna be
back up and running ok can restore those

192
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:44,510
documents and you can you can deal with
a catastrophic event to cloud or not to

193
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:49,130
cloud has a lot of debate about this is
public clouds as private clouds as

194
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:56,480
hybrid clouds clouds cloud thing but I
believe that the world is moving to a

195
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,100
cloud Windows 10 is the last windows
released after that it's going to be

196
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,150
windows cloud ok so we can avoid it and
certainly you can find a cloud that you

197
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,590
like a cloud that you can put some data
in my feeling is that from a day-to-day

198
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,060
standpoint people don't like to do
backups so aside from something that

199
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,390
might be super secret super critical
that you might have that I don't know

200
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,990
what that is

201
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,520
cloud would be a good way to do some
daily backup now also I would suggest

202
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,040
you have a secondary you do the full
backup onto that hard drive maybe once a

203
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,769
week

204
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,319
months whatever works for you but in
between you put some things in the

205
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:36,149
clouds so this kind of coverage in a
couple things remember security needs to

206
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,989
be done in layers so here we don't have
a single failure point we're trying to

207
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:45,029
establish some layers to help us recover
and protect our data archive pictures

208
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,579
and videos I want to say something about
that those usually take up a lot of

209
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:53,799
space and a lot of times you know maybe
it's stuff we're saving four years it's

210
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,410
the kids baby pictures or some such
thing and you don't need access to all

211
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,699
the time maybe cloud is not the right
thing maybe that you wanna put on

212
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:05,618
another hard drive and stashed away as
far as hard drive to stash away I like

213
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:09,209
Western Digital black drives I don't
like the Green drives fail we do a lot

214
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,549
of forensic work so we burn through a
lot of drives the black works with a

215
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:18,420
nice SSD drives are great for Speed not
great for backup and the reason is this

216
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,988
it will recover data from a mechanical
drive we can do that in a clean room

217
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:29,480
when St drive fails it's gone so those
pictures and things you want to keep for

218
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,660
ten years or whatever

219
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,379
put them on a good old mechanical drive
stashed away and that's a better

220
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:44,399
solution for that malware and virus
everybody's got on everybody needs one

221
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,850
is the free one is the one I pay for
what is it I don't know how do I choose

222
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,559
which one

223
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,589
well I can't test all the viruses I can
test a dozen different baby products but

224
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:59,240
there are people who do that so I like
PC world comes up with a study in

225
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,279
there's a few other people that do that
every year they list here is the top

226
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,659
guys I tried bunch of stuff against it

227
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:08,639
you know maybe once a winner one year
and other winner the other year but I

228
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:11,629
generally look at the top one two or
three people and for one reason or

229
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,480
another maybe somebody has better

230
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,020
mystic algorithms to detect things that
are not in the virus signatures but now

231
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,470
will be recognized by their behavior you
know and she can go with one of those

232
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:28,890
and be relatively safe that you're going
to sell a lot of those problems so we go

233
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,560
then there's rootkits and mostly people
have root get scanners you are familiar

234
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,690
with those can run a few refunds can as
those are typically free give you a

235
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,620
little extra level of security scanning
see that you've taken care of that as

236
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,239
well try to start with a clean system
going on you know you wanna do these

237
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,720
checks and drive-by downloads well this
is i mean these are the new attacks

238
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,590
right when you hear about the social
engineering all that it's typically see

239
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,850
to come in through an email sometimes
called upon the phone said oh yeah hey

240
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,770
I'm a nice guy and he did do something
for me and go to this page

241
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,030
drive-by download your own to click on
attachment you not to do any of that

242
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:15,670
stuff so you want to be a little bit of
where those things and there are some

243
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,790
tools that will talk about later that
you can actually test attachments or

244
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,909
other things other sites before you go
there to see if there's a problem

245
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,910
ok so we're going to create some layers
there as well

246
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,860
management this is a good how many of
you've done network administration

247
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,110
Johanns here quite a few ok well then
you know that patch management is the

248
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,969
blessing and the bane of network
administration because it's always

249
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,670
something new to patch and you gotta do
it before a good host ok as an

250
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,040
individual however what we do I don't
have i don't have a department of people

251
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,680
to managing patches for me unlike
Windows box or whatever I've got home a

252
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,480
Windows has Windows Update but they only
care about Windows so what about all the

253
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,520
other stuff I'm using alright well as a
couple tools that I found that you can

254
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,100
use one of my company called secure area
called personal software inspector been

255
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,070
using this for a while

256
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,750
pretty good stuff what they do is
installed on their it looks at all your

257
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,700
installed software goes against their
database finds out if you've got the

258
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,320
latest version and in the background it
will download and install the upgrade

259
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,179
for you

260
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,500
managing those patches if you have a
math there's a thing called app fresh

261
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,570
that does a similar thing as Kenya's
done some testing they found it in their

262
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:36,220
way of their management of these things
they've seen that about 87% of the

263
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,549
exploits that get become public have
patches available the day of the

264
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:46,179
release so if you're using that software
that takes care of a lot of that not a

265
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:50,409
hundred percent but most things get
passed relatively quickly even if

266
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:54,350
they're not available in the first day
and when that happens the software

267
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,549
programs will automatically update and
keep your system up-to-date so here is

268
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:02,820
kind of a mindless way that you can set
somebody that has some additional layers

269
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:09,059
of protection on their ok so the couple
could tools data security firewalls yes

270
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,720
you need one they're all built-in you
got a useful and even if you don't use a

271
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,609
third party one change the default
passwords obvious stuff right we've

272
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:21,820
we've we all know that use encryption on
wifi good idea but how about if you

273
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,899
really want to be paranoid you can turn
off the broadcast you can hide the fact

274
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:29,248
that you've got it there then you're if
they don't know you're there how can the

275
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:33,609
attack so it makes you a smaller target
makes you a hard target to get these

276
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:38,960
things are simple to do but not really
doesn so here are some ideas for you and

277
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,039
your loved ones

278
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,869
ok about browsers well I don't care what
browser you they've all got

279
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,439
vulnerabilities from time to time so
we'll want to do is keep those patches

280
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,539
up Java flash everybody knows those are
big big inroads into finding the day

281
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,220
finding the next explored there's some
browser help us called HTTPS Everywhere

282
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,049
which is that on the eff outta work site
and NoScript Security Suite these are

283
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:08,340
two good ones that will add another
level of protection to your online

284
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,918
browser ok now I mentioned that I had a
couple tools for these little gems here

285
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,070
kinda cool they do a variety of things
if you get an attachment from someone

286
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,519
you think you know who they are but
you're not sure where something that I

287
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,590
don't know if I want to open it right
away you can upload that two to one of

288
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,529
these sites and that will test it for
you if you have a link that they say go

289
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:34,629
here you can upload that link and it
will sandbox said run-through find out

290
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:37,480
how many people come back with a record
in a few minutes tell you how many

291
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,779
redirects Aurora what exploits were
there what else is happening if it's

292
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:45,559
good to go or no you don't go there so
couple handy little things here that you

293
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:50,109
know at your toolkit gives you that
extra layer of protection if you know if

294
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:53,580
it slips through these first layer so
defenses are still not sure

295
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,560
you run some other tests on it get a
second or third opinion and you have a

296
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,820
greater degree of safety and security
here

297
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,230
VMware everybody's talked about that
trade you really need to isolate

298
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,250
something not everyone needs it but it's
a great tool if you do if you are

299
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,610
traveling the dark Weber going to risky
places in doing certain things maybe 120

300
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:22,620
bpm machine just say bpm if you travel
you should obviously have one there's a

301
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,459
number out there that can be useful

302
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,970
let your Google down and cell phone
risks ok south on risk people talk about

303
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,010
them bring your own device and all those
things going on is being risked I think

304
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,190
the cell phone wrist the biggest risk of
cell phone is losing it because it can

305
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,250
it's it's much more than a dialing
machine now it's a computer in your

306
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,540
pocket it has access to all kinds of
things and if you don't put a password

307
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,159
on it and you leave yourself logged in
your email and I get a hold of that I

308
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,030
can reset all your other passwords on
your bank accounts and everything I mean

309
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,550
these are obvious things right and I
tell you anything new

310
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,860
know that people don't always think
about it so systematically these things

311
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,209
and we can go through and make sure that
at least we got all the boxes checked

312
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:13,250
let's talk about passwords now the my
idea for an account and password audit

313
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:13,820
is this

314
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:21,149
surveys have shown that the that most
people may have between 50 and 75

315
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,770
different accounts that they have
passwords for some have more some less

316
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,760
but you probably find yourself somewhere
in that room now it's obviously

317
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,480
difficult to remember seventy five
different password especially if they're

318
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,620
going to be any good so in this
self-assessment process just like we be

319
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,620
assessing the self-assessment process I
feel it's reluctant to go through and

320
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,909
make a list of all the accounts and you
have go through the old email you get

321
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,760
something

322
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,020
here for a while oh yeah maybe don't
need that anymore make a list right now

323
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,840
all the accounts that you have write
down all the passwords that you have and

324
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,290
see if some of those who still need you
want strong passwords and obviously on

325
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,200
the financial side she wanted better
press words then maybe on your LA times

326
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,620
are wired subscription which could be
something simpler to remember and

327
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,129
remembering stuff if you have that may
so a password management program can

328
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:25,240
help here one in particular comes to
mind it's called dash lane and the nice

329
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,910
thing about dashed lines it runs on both
platforms I think actually they may even

330
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,590
have a Linux version of it but it runs
on the PC and runs on the mac and the

331
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,790
other thing that it has it's interesting
is that if you have a breach and you

332
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:43,490
decide well I need to reset my password
to keep my account safe it has a bulk

333
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:49,800
has a box feature to allow it to go do
that that will simplify and speed that

334
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,830
process for you hopefully you'll never
need it but it's nice to know that

335
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,290
that's there when you're writing down
all those passwords are things you want

336
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,110
to store that a safe place to remember
that fireproof safe where you're putting

337
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,750
this extra backup down in the basement
in the garage somewhere where it's not

338
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,450
going to get you know messed up with
your computer

339
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,120
that's where you put those two zip lock
bags are nice because you know I think

340
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,580
it's hose down in tears I can't read it
whatever print that out

341
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,449
put a nice block sticking in there with
with your backups that's a good process

342
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,910
ok while you're in there looking around
checking account compromises have been

343
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,880
some of these accounts for a while and
you find there's a bunch of activity and

344
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,860
its not me that would be a red flag you
want to know about that and it counts as

345
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,209
you're not using other avenues for
people to impersonate your identity if

346
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,200
you don't need it you don't use it shut
it down to cancel it that's part of the

347
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,320
odds what are we keeping what we get rid
of all we have a strong enough passwords

348
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,149
on those and that's all part of the fun
at sea have recovery plan so we're

349
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,550
talking about different ways to recover
having those passwords either in a

350
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:59,070
management system or written down is
going to help you do that so

351
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:08,330
don't use your puppy's name as you're ok
now we all like sharing but certainly

352
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,710
some of us have some secrets of maybe we
don't want to get out ok so we need to

353
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,220
consider some of those things as well

354
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,769
ok and so that brings me into our second
second cornerstone here identity and

355
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:24,059
reputation and here we're gonna talk
about social networks the impact they

356
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:32,200
can have a number of things number of
things that impact your identity as well

357
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,720
as your reputation that's what people
think of you are offline as well as

358
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,200
online ok so let's talk a little bit
about that social networks we love them

359
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,139
ok there was a time there was a time
that they weren't here but many of us

360
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:50,350
can't remember that because they're so
ubiquitous and you know it's a selfie

361
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,779
generation I need to take a picture here
of all is that I'm going to use or

362
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,820
something but felt he sticks with the
hottest toy or gift this Christmas and

363
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,570
this thing is becoming ubiquitous
everywhere obviously we also tend to not

364
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,100
read euless we also tend to give up
other people's data to you know pay

365
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,918
flippy playfully birds or question candy
or other time killer that we need to

366
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,139
waste our time on yeah I care not that I
care about my privacy but not so much

367
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:22,168
about your exam willing to give all my
friends email addresses to the App

368
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:23,019
Inventor

369
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:29,299
just for a chance to level up tracking
in big data that's obviously a lot of

370
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:34,110
this stuff goes into those marketing
systems and inference attacks and other

371
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,799
types of things a marketing tool called
inference attacks hackers will call it

372
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,230
in for its attacks but they're just
collecting data to know more about you

373
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,840
k in the pentagon a number of
intelligence agency they are not talking

374
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,799
about open source intelligence open
source intelligence means I don't have

375
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:57,240
to have spies spies in the field
necessarily well I do but most of you

376
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,039
share so much that I can get it for free

377
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,620
ok so you need to be careful with a
little bit of that ok employers if

378
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,989
you're looking for a job there are I've
come across systems marketed to H are

379
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,520
people that do

380
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,310
massive investigations across all the
social network and they find out all

381
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,510
kinds of stuff about you so you know
maybe those maybe recent pictures of

382
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,190
that wild party in mexico last weekend
are good to put up right away just say

383
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,790
so what else we got multimedia well we
will have cameras or phones or cameras

384
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,700
and you see a separate device now it's
with everyone ok so Andy Warhol said

385
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,190
that everyone will have their 15 minutes
of fame yes you will maybe more than

386
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:46,530
that because as memories fade internet
posts live on forever so careful and and

387
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,270
you can't always be sure if you're the
one taking the picture of somebody else

388
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,370
is taking the picture of video of you in
this brings me to trial by social media

389
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:59,100
we've all seen recently a number of
examples in the press of individuals who

390
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,250
found themselves or their conversations
filmed and shared when they were

391
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,820
supposed to be private or they didn't
know it was happening and the problem

392
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,899
with that is not to say that individuals
didn't do bad things that should have

393
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,370
been disclosed but just as often
probably are people doing things that

394
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,159
maybe are being taken out of context but
once it goes viral everyone judges that

395
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,670
on the sound bite and you know it's it's
cost people their jobs it's also been

396
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,550
dangerous for people traveling if you're
in a country that's not as democratic as

397
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,250
ours people have been arrested for
tweeting the wrong thing at the wrong

398
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,140
time so we need to be aware and careful
those things as we're traveling as well

399
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:46,030
as just our day-to-day ok so in summary
be careful what you share and hear some

400
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,520
of the things you can do now

401
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,410
practice for the people investigating
you are for all paranoid we think

402
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,240
they're out to get us well you're
paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to

403
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,920
get you but one thing you should try to
do is find out what can they know about

404
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,520
you

405
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,389
well good way to do that is Google
yourself you can use that to find out

406
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,940
what other people do in fact Google's
got an interesting service that I use

407
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,640
where you can put a search term review
search firms in there and if those items

408
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,110
come up with some new information like I
use my name it emails me and says oh by

409
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,919
the way there's something new out there
about you as kind of a good way to keep

410
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,360
track of your own identity

411

identity fraud as well that's why you
need to check those things out this is

421
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,780
where the start to show you can contact
the you can contact TransUnion or any

422
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,470
other credit bureaus directly and have a
way to identify yourself and they may

423
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,559
have to go back and forth with you on
some on some other channel but you will

424
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:38,418
be able to do it in that fashion ok so I
can say that credit card fraud alerts if

425
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:41,900
you've heard about these there if you
have been victimized CreditWatch can

426
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,860
stop people from open up things to learn
is kind of a more severe one if you have

427
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,010
a fraud alert you can get another credit
card camera to house until you take it

428
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,070
off so if you really been under the gun
and they've been a scraping you with

429
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,049
identity fraud that's the only
protection left but it's a little bit

430
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,270
severe and have to renew at about every
six months

431
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:03,270
question the front

432
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,250
yeah credit for his if you use these
services like LifeLock they do similar

433
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:15,380
things like that yes you can do it
yourself also yeah but you know time is

434
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,670
money so depending on which one you may
want to spend the $10 a month with a

435
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:24,020
credit service that does that and you
want one that does it in real time not

436
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,430
the tells you a month later oh by the
way you got screwed ok so lifelike the

437
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,590
big name out there and I think the guy
was in it he's the one who's supposed to

438
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:37,439
social security number on billboards I'm
so safe and he was scam so many

439
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,170
different ways because that but despite
his ignorance the services rather decent

440
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,220
and its comprehensive so if you want
something to compare others with a look

441
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,220
at that and look at the others and
decide for yourself

442
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,500
anybody in here at independent
consultant work your hands ok any of you

443
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,750
use ein numbers for those of you that
don't know what it is I don't like

444
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,690
sharing my social with everybody or
anybody really employer identification

445
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,330
number you can get it's free you fill
out a form of the IRS to get the thing

446
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,030
and now on that W nine form that you
sent to the employer of who you are

447
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,790
use the N number because you know I
don't know why there's I don't know how

448
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:19,420
their story that information I'm not
about to give myself so that lowers your

449
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,140
exposure there and in all these things
you want to make copies of your stuff oh

450
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,290
I forgot to mention Facebook is
something you can download your entire

451
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,170
history from Facebook to see what you
really been doing

452
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,400
sometimes it's interesting in doing
yourself investigation and another site

453
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,940
here pipl.com is a popular one for doing
searches for you across social networks

454
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,970
and other media another placement so
here's a couple places in a very short

455
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:47,370
period time you can get a fairly decent
idea on what's out there on be ok are

456
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:51,300
the things out there that I don't want
to be or not that they're out there I

457
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,950
need to take some reaction to that so
couple things you can do there

458
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,879
well we've all become if you're if you
start a business or website we've all

459
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,680
become whores from Google it's all about
my balls and yet at the same time there

460
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,900
are some positive things there but we
don't always want to be sharing

461
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,168
everything

462
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:20,629
and sometimes there's a need to do
something more private so how to be seen

463
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:25,779
you can use anonymous search engine for
concern about tracking cookies and

464
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:31,879
things ok you can create alternate
identities this is not in a particular

465
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:36,989
order but I can tell you from doing a
lot of business employee investigative

466
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:46,348
type of things were bad shit going on in
the company if you look at it you're

467
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,079
going to catch them it's dumb don't do
it that's that's all I can say is that

468
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,329
ok temporary email account sometimes you
try to do something you want your email

469
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:59,049
to send you a link to a whatever
ten-minute email it's a great site you

470
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:03,910
get an email account was that you get
the link back its self destruct in 10

471
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:08,040
minutes ok nice simple nice simple
solution there's others out there that's

472
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,790
what I've used personally think it works
pretty well use encryption PDP is one

473
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:16,190
and now we're all worried about the NSA
be able break encryption have back doors

474
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,609
and on the same company and this and
that they're still having trouble with

475
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:26,160
so if you gotta pick something that's
that's a reasonable one in this popular

476
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,790
never been around a long time

477
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,920
wrote that a long time ago to deal with
to help countries and tell the

478
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,799
individual dissidents in different
countries and it's been a pretty solid

479
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:40,059
product ever since the Onion Router
there's a tax on the underground have

480
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:43,290
you guys heard about the timing attacks
were a few control certain number the in

481
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,680
the country knows and the exit nodes
which in the United States about 58% of

482
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,950
Commerce controlled potentially by
government entities or someone related

483
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:57,540
to that in China it's about 88 percent
depending on where you are neither

484
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,210
situation is very good there's a
re-creation of that project called

485
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,430
Astoria that's that's coming out now
that's the starting to gain some

486
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,328
traction and this is going to try to fix
that problem so something to keep

487
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:16,250
abreast of you are a tour type person
other tricks and techniques well if you

488
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:22,050
really get the black phone from silent
circle you can use wicker as a text

489
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,130
is a texting solution there are other
anonymous communication methods as well

490
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,940
and something I discovered recently that
I thought was kind of fun was an

491
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,180
application called flash chat now here's
the deal with flash chip was kind of fun

492
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:43,430
if you / Chat allows anybody that's
connected to the same wireless router to

493
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,600
be connected together and communicate so
let's say that you had some civil rights

494
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,460
issues that you were demonstrated a need
to coordinate with your people and what

495
00:36:52,460 --> 00:37:00,630
have you and you had a small portable
open source router like this is you

496
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:07,290
could set that up and be somewhere with
a backpack and communicate your other

497
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:13,930
team members to connect to this thing
you meeting at the park at noon and we

498
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:18,620
can all talk and you can preserve
anonymity and yet create communications

499
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,609
and coronations and also some other
interesting things so just kind of throw

500
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:29,770
that out there right so that brings us
to the end of our second phase which was

501
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,640
identifying reputation now what I want
to do is talk about its all about the

502
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:40,080
money that's what you have that they
want so whether it's phishing attacks or

503
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,549
some other attack going on you need to
be able to protect the money that you

504
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,670
have ok so we're gonna talk about a
couple things that you can do they're

505
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,360
simple straightforward and it'll
increase your hardness against that

506
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,740
attack right so where we exposed here

507
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,529
banking banking investments a 401k
whatever you've got online their online

508
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:04,360
shopping and my favorites camps windows
and cons ok we're going to cover these

509
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,740
banking you obviously want to protect
access your accounts Arby's got the

510
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,740
secret PIN number we've got this super
duper password for their online access

511
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,790
and you know now that there are skimmers
that in certain areas when you put that

512
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,920
card in the bad guy is getting its
impression a lot of these things are

513
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,720
made to well so what I always do is kind
of pull on the thing and see if it's a

514
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,879
good one or not

515
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,640
that works at an ATM machine sometimes
are fake sometimes in the card thing

516
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,390
there they got a camera that's looking
at you taking your PIN so what you wanna

517
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,308
do you want to put your hand or
something over European just to be sure

518
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:46,079
okay they have some algorithms that if
they see your knuckles and fingers

519
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,009
moving they can figure out which things
so so covered good enough and do your

520
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:58,769
PIN that way that a limit your exposure
just that much more than a credit card

521
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:06,960
gas pumps a lot of scams with the gas
pumps now stanley steamer so I never use

522
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,789
a credit card at a gas pump anymore

523
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:13,250
first ones were discovered a couple of
years ago in Malibu and there's a whole

524
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,720
organized crime road that runs around
stealing gas and stealing credit cards

525
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,730
they now have wireless units in those
things they just have to drive by and to

526
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,490
get the dumps down and continue on so
that would be bad so I can use cash

527
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,250
there that's my way of doing it you may
feel differently ATM cards I never use

528
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,960
an ATM card except that my bank and the
reason is this even though it says it's

529
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,769
a visa or mastercard or what have you

530
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:42,078
it doesn't have the same element of
protection as a credit card does if you

531
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,190
get a bad charging a credit card you
call them up and go hey that wasn't me

532
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,509
to go thank you very much

533
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:51,009
sure we'll take it off your bill and
investigate boom done somebody get your

534
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:53,589
tummy get your ATM goes to the bank

535
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:56,700
Grainger County call the bank will
hasten it took all my money and they go

536
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,509
wow I'm sorry to hear that but now
you're overdrawn you have any more money

537
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:05,890
so they don't have the same level
protection there I don't think you

538
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,038
should use ATM ATM cards for getting
anything except out of your ATM and you

539
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,359
know it secure and that's it i never use
it online

540
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,089
that would be bad my estimation so
things are an absolute but they will

541
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:23,069
each one will lower your risk disclosure
a little bit and then stolen checks you

542
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:26,970
know people still use checks in this
year of online payments and auto pace

543
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,709
and all that

544
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,920
yes there's still some old school checks
one round or you might receive some one

545
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,220
of the things that used to be an exploit
against Texas called check washing a bit

546
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,740
her that ok got a few people check
washington's basically if you haven't

547
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,379
heard they take your check which they
still are your mailbox

548
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,000
what have you and they use a solvent
they take the check with the signature

549
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,960
site up and they did that in there and
it dissolves the part that you wrote but

550
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,810
they keep your signature and then they
refill in their name any appropriate

551
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,509
amount of cash that chip ok so how do
you defend against that

552
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:08,620
well it costs $2 to defend against that
for $2 you go out to you by a pen

553
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,930
ballpoint pen just like any other but
it's cool but it's not it's the ink is

554
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,930
called the gel pen and a gel pen ink has
a different that's not a pigment ink but

555
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,190
it has particles in at embed themselves
in the paper so when they try to watch

556
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:27,300
it leaves artifacts it doesn't wash it
does not work that stops them from Czech

557
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,750
washing so I write all my checks with
gel pens now and so should you two bucks

558
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,390
veiled staples anyplace you can find
them everywhere just look for the one

559
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:41,450
that says gel pen on it and stuff online

560
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,419
well there's a lot of fraud online and
Amazon eBay and Craigslist am done does

561
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,180
a fairly decent job but they still have
a lot even a there's a lot of fraud on

562
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:55,940
eBay and Craigslist should anybody on
Craigslist so we've all seen ads where

563
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,860
they're going to send you a check for
greater than the amount and you send

564
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,120
them the car

565
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,310
stupid things like that nobody is gonna
fall during those but some people do

566
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,210
ugly enough and also your physical
security when your meeting somebody on

567
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,560
Craigslist you want to do it in the
daylight if there's money involved it's

568
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,540
of any substance bring a friend in the
daytime you in a public place a lot of

569
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,360
things you see on Craigslist on eBay and
Amazon they have ratings but you want to

570
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,640
look at the rain is to see if it's not
being pumped up by someone else you know

571
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,910
are these ratings in new and they've all
come into the same you know a few weeks

572
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:33,080
by people that sell this wonderful new
complaints ok so be careful about

573
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,540
trusting some of that cause there's no
real good verification system some those

574
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,040
who see the same thing on Yelp I'm
involving a couple cases recently that

575
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,170
have been identity damage kind of things
where businesses felt that someone or

576
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,900
some competitor was putting bad shit up
about a month

577
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:56,570
on Yelp and that can go both ways if you
putting stuff up on the abuse you go

578
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,870
into a store and like us on Yelp and get
10% off but i wanna buy this a 10% off

579
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:08,259
so they're great ok trust but verify
here ok be a little bit suspicious be a

580
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,530
little cautious transaction security
well we can use credit cards do that but

581
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,300
at the same time if we're dealing with
companies that were not so sure of then

582
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,330
you might want to put a buffer between
you and your credit card and one way to

583
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,220
do that is to use a service like PayPal
it does cost your percentage however

584
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,640
security costs something and there might
be opportunities are incidents where

585
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:36,299
that makes it good idea for you in
addition to that if you're buying things

586
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,120
from other risky sites shall we say you
might want to use prepaid credit cards

587
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,730
rather than your credit card credit
cards don't have your name on them but

588
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,830
they're good for a Visa MasterCard
American Express you usually get them up

589
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:56,920
to $500 so and they can come in handy in
certain situations silkroad bitcoins but

590
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,360
even the Bitcoin people nowadays because
the fluctuation of bitcoins has been so

591
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,350
radical we're finding that there quickly
converting their bitcoins into cash or

592
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:10,230
other currencies so it's really becoming
a transitory ease monetary medium rather

593
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:17,270
than something to hold for investment
purposes but I digress ok frauds and

594
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,020
scams

595
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,470
this is the fun stuff to markets can
still happen things happen in the mail I

596
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,689
got something in the mail the other day
that said here confirm your listing in

597
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:31,110
the in the National yellow pages or
something that looked like ok I get

598
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,100
these all the time from a business yes
yes yes that's me find Senate in about a

599
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:40,299
month later I got a bill that showed
that showed that on there and they were

600
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,450
expecting me to pay like $400 for the
listing and like weight as you know call

601
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,819
these people are they go it's not really
a bill of your stupid enough to not read

602
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,560
the fine print some of the money and a
lot of companies don't get these things

603
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,350
and it'll just go through the system so
I have to be careful there whenever

604
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,529
there's a disaster

605
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,310
fake charities and stuff get put up
there

606
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:05,610
for scams you need to have people watch
for that you know Red Cross there some

607
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:13,710
big names that you can trust that twenty
or thirty that is 10 okay so Spanish

608
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,150
prisoners a type of advanced fee fraud
you don't want to ask for money up front

609
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:21,190
before they deliver that would be bad
we're going home for shipments those are

610
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:25,100
all related to that and the grandmas

gotta think before you act that's the

613
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:41,560
main message here and there is ok just
quickly they want you to react quickly

614
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,860
they want to do not think they wanted to
keep it to yourself

615
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:50,230
the red flags are you get offered an
unusual high rate of return ok double

616
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:54,180
your money there's very few if any
legitimate investments we can do that

617
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,580
guarantee they won't guarantee it's hard
to find any information about this

618
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,890
opportunity company or individuals that

people are going

622
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,310
involved in the scam to fall for that
and the need to keep it a secret don't

623
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:22,360
tell anyone because it's a special thing
and you the special person you ok so be

624
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,020
prepared beforehand

in the room ok so be prepared beforehand

627
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,940
so on the physical side you've got some
risk their work work work here we go

00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:46,790
concerned with so what do we do

630
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,440
well here's an idea go outside look at

or something or what this curious like
your house tonight like around what can

632
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,660
you tell from across the street

633
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,350
what can you see inside what's the
exposure from you or your neighbors or

634
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,120
what have you

635
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,970
this may be enlightened if you've only
seen it from the inside never thought

636
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,810
about this different perspectives here
helpful because the guys go after your

637
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,279
gonna be outside what they can learn

638
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,070
is what they know they can plan on what
to do discuss it with your plan to

639
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,360
discuss with your friends and work that
out

640
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,800
ok think through the different scenarios
disasters that you might encounter

641
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,410
whether it's earthquakes or floods or
tornadoes or what have you and have a

642
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,899
plan beforehand what you want to do much
better than trying to come up with it at

643
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,940
the moment

644
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:40,250
jump bag escape plan patty talk a couple
years ago we had a lot of great ideas

645
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:44,760
about jump bag an escape plan in the
archived somewhere I would recommend you

646
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,720
check that out and here's the last thing
first n Red Cross ok when you're in a

647
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,319
disaster you might be the first one on
the scene there's a number of people in

648
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,070
in our group I know our client who was
just speaking in a number of people are

649
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:03,180
EMTs and done this training this is your
chance to really potentially save a life

650
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:09,750
and we're talking about mad skillz this
is kind of tax you can know so I suggest

651
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,770
you all take the class at six hours plus
about a hundred and ten bucks there

652
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:16,590
every week somewhere and you could be
here are some day you could you could

653
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:23,800
make a big difference so with that we've
got it covered the the physical the

654
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,630
state security the identity and
reputation financial and some things

655
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,810
about physical Siri and I think they're
breaking things down into these

656
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:37,080
different cornerstones allows you to put
some better management and better

657
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,250
security into place to do that so with
that I want to just touch on the

658
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,740
beginning which was the death of privacy
reasons it's hard to fight city hall and

659
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,850
as an individual it may be but there are
some organizations out there that are

660
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,759
gathering together their resources are
doing that and they're worthy of

661
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,690
checking out the eff is one of them for
the Electronic Frontier Foundation the

662
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,660
American Civil Liberties Association and
certainly conferences like the likelier

663
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,600
one and others allow you to keep up to
date and a breast at the latest things

664
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,270
of what's happening and what you need to
do for that so and don't forget to vote

665
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:15,250
cuz you get the government you deserve
with that some final thoughts you're

666
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,480
responsible you need to take this into
consideration need to take the bull by

667
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,380
the horns as they say you need to become
more aware of the world around you

668
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,490
which will make you better prepare

669
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:28,250
air to meet the challenge against your
data your identity or money yourself and
