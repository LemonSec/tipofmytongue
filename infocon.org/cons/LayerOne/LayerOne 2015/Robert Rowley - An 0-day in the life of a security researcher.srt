1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:11,330
did you guys have a good time at the
party last night good good

2
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:18,009
our next talk is by Robert rally call
dunno day in the life of a security

3
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,010
researcher

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:40,860
sounds good right after waking up and
being here

5
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,530
nursing your hangover is with croissants
in orange use to go ahead and do the

6
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,530
talk is that has a disease a day you
know the saudi life ski resorts can walk

7
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,879
through how I deal with were my work as
security researcher we're just leaving

8
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,940
the spider webs Department a lot of what
I do they do not have my thing done

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,210
right there we go a lot of what I do in
the stock is basically go through

10
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,809
popular vulnerabilities in the last year

11
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,600
talking about ghosts RPC like to call up
indication that is the end of

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,780
presentation go on getting lunch so he
said

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,509
rally work for Trustwave spider webs
department but around here for a long

14
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,770
time of unity talks here later won in
the past who here seen any of those wow

15
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,630
a lot of people to get like me that much
are you just like had nothing else to

16
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:47,530
help run aground I start up a camp she
hasn't talked about a few inches in

17
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,299
doing that already happen this year

18
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:53,740
spoken a lot of times good times here
hope that I'm at least entertaining

19
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,408
enough qualified BBC see a lot of fun
coming from my experience from a melting

20
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,470
by noon on Twitter only

21
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:07,869
harass the shit out of me I don't care
it's ok so what's this talk all about

22
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:13,720
I'm gonna be talking about how my day my
made it a goes to the east come down the

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,700
pipe I have to look at them reverse
engineer them who's done this is like

24
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,359
really look at a CD and try to figure
proof of concept from it

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
concept wasn't provided for a treat

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,579
coincidentally a news item PHP Apache
and everybody's favorite content

27
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:37,389
management system WordPress we're like
WordPress we like to request as you use

28
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,240
it who here likes to invest because you
hack it

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:49,720
basically get another WordPress can talk
that's cool utility but I'm not talking

30
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,870
about that is not how to hack your
wordpress.com trying to focus and

31
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,470
incidentally of all these things are on
Wordpress I'm talking about my life as a

32
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,630
security researcher kind of the process
that involved how to exploit

33
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,560
vulnerabilities at all you have a CBE
I'm just picking on Wordpress for about

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:15,440
the next hour as it is easy pickings in
a lot of people like to say that I wrote

35
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,910
this presentation about a month ago
which predated on the cross site

36
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,320
scripting persistent prosecuting stuff
they came out last month I'm sorry and

37
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,150
that's simply covering the sea bees
those are like quite nice shutdowns of

38
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,110
everything and I had to cover our people
and we're pressing security is a two

39
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,430
aspects were trusting you d like to see
the chorus secure

40
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,420
just the plugins just the themes not our
fault in the security community just

41
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,589
like to say everything is insecure and
never use it nobody ever upgrades had a

42
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,110
bad experience

43
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,430
oil and water these two groups so it's
kind of interesting like the describe

44
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,630
some of the year that commingling of
spoken word press conferences in fact

45
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm wearing a work camp t-shirt
underneath this is really interesting

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,980
how the hell that group benefits a room
about this site ABC had this one team

47
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,630
already up here like interspersed
throughout the entire crowd that's all

48
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,980
the people that would show up for a
security talking to work press

49
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,738
conference and then specifically at the
Phoenix when they were tearing down the

50
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,429
street around me because I'm trying to
finish the security talk as you're like

51
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,410
oh yeah nobody here to like this is my
fault

52
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,110
open wifi like unsecured wifi for
everybody their intellect as bad to try

53
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,430
to tell them is that they like

54
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,670
people will figure it out on their own
like no no no no they don't show this is

55
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:47,860
why security and I'm going to ghost who
knows ghost get hurt by a guy named

56
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,320
vulnerability came out in three months
ago so pretty big I wrote a song about

57
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,610
it is called I was hanging with the
girls who cover of Tegan and Sara you

58
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,680
know I said please please publish El
Paso CV's come in they may work I you

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,290
know I wake up and get coffee and you
know somebody somewhere who wakes up

60
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,970
earlier than me is already heard about
the vulnerability in their freaking out

61
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:17,070
knowing only I do have coverage like
what's going on with this TV is that's

62
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,260
where you know obviously in VD

63
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,370
get all the all the info be everything
that is what it looks like

64
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,650
based buffer overflow in underscore an
assassin named Richard Dutrow falling

65
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,229
asleep another cup of coffee by the time
you read this it is exactly no

66
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,030
information there is a proof of concept
of new information so well everybody's

67
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,250
freaking out and demanding that I rates
and sort of vulnerability detection for

68
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,990
this microphone over the detention I'm
just a seagoing I have no idea what I'm

69
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,190
doing I can I just went ahead and got a
Starbucks latte the rest of the day but

70
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:56,440
not happening to find some way to do
this and as I mentioned in WordPress so

71
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,850
vulnerability in WordPress that excluded
the ghost vulnerability which had lived

72
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,310
in GA Lipsy just really hard to detect
over the networks are yet to find a

73
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,340
service or process that was going to use
the Gypsy requested you again host baby

74
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:16,140
name lookup who can think about what
component workforce does this antenna

75
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,210
can do this at any point in time did you
read the blog post

76
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,380
shutout sheeting

77
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:34,679
so yeah basically BC you really liked
your post I posted about your post on my

78
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,060
site so you should I give me a plane
back is what it's called it's very

79
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,539
strange terminology so you may see tell
it I posted about you on my site and

80
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,360
what it does it actually doesn't look at
the request of your site information

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,389
just to verify the post there but by
doing so it'll look up of the domain

82
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:55,900
name that's where you can force the
couple that's where you see the disease

83
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,250
get hurt by editor function call and
everything goes downhill from there

84
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,680
this is the site you thought it this is
this is comments was thinks this ruin a

85
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:16,090
slide in question so far so this is
awesome a quick little foray into how to

86
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,869
get my display credentials without
trying so some people talk about a PC

87
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,410
and turns out I had pre-existing code
that attacked XML RPC are going to

88
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,479
ensure the CBC grab the a pre-existing
code already have the DS an attack

89
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,710
against a similar be seen just dumped in
the attack code I wrote it we published

90
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,388
it basically just basic at the URL to
attack the militias houses 0 times 2,500

91
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,470
times and that's all you need to do that

92
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,849
compromises he dumped into valid XML
that you sent to explore PCs is dumped

93
00:07:53,849 --> 00:08:00,840
into actually not correctly points cuz
they dont care and he just jumped up by

94
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,580
2500 characters of 0 RBC host name to it
and then you make the request of the

95
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,710
bottom where you do that at least be
start and all that stuff I just looks

96
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,380
for the response gave responded back to
the 500 that means you're vulnerable to

97
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,310
respond by five hundred different like
that you can pretty much assume it's

98
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,289
it's not more so as to ensure we
released that in this is what it looks

99
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,510
like and validated it in the post logs
so

100
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:36,409
PHP to crash out right and industrial
engineering get very far this hits you

101
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,470
hard actually get a

102
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,570
she'll return from this is mostly very
easy like 'cause processes in Apache

103
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,370
Junction right everything fails
catastrophic but from iris perspective

104
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,840
as the security researcher with the
tools that I work on the truth before

105
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,170
the first better lives and trust leave
is to detect it are you vulnerable did

106
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:01,160
you you failed to find a passion to find
out when they meet your PC processor

107
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,209
processes are injured next processes
crash is a really long hosting a

108
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,250
validation that I can send it to you
send it to the pen tester is going after

109
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,370
your network and you can keep going down
that route or not so that happened and

110
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:21,380
we go up and we we read a blog post
because we do security people we were

111
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,790
these loans obviously those qualities
they had to go pick the designer for the

112
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,459
logo and the custom domain name

113
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,670
well we have to do what I like to do is
just a blog post he wrote a blog post

114
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,089
about you could see why they are writing
a blog post I was busy learning the

115
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:42,830
chords to get answers I was walking with
a ghost so you can see it I was happy

116
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:49,340
with the ghost write it up and then this
happens somebody named she didn't have

117
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,810
his name is David somewhere on here it's
like 55 for something really

118
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,750
inappropriate moniker I really like the
fact that it's like somebody with the

119
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,660
name part in the moniker reference to me

120
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,370
Todd be here they're saving but so this
happened like you may display module

121
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,380
that they use are published POC I was in
the blog post

122
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,729
boom right there is my name first and
the author listed the cause I medically

123
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,500
credentials without even trying to
update my resume because I can see rules

124
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,770
already damn the code so what have you
learned in life is free ice cream

125
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,620
pumpkin spice lattes and puppies
everything is written security field

126
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,070
because everything into your always
critical validation other ships and

127
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:41,470
properly resourced back and forth rate
is what it is and groans so we're going

128
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:47,950
on there was like a day you know where
anything is so happy for lattes and

129
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,730
puppies up a collection of art pieces
see some more just as there are some

130
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,550
more vulnerabilities here and so this
this talk who knows about expansion

131
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:04,219
attacks may see you next values and and
and linkbacks 22 to another entity

132
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,590
within a within XML based on hearsay
laws is just the stream lolz involves

133
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,930
two references lols a bunch of times and
lost three levels involves two

134
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:20,370
exponential growth of your your memory
usage for anybody who's trying to read

135
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,490
in this data and you don't have to send
a pic you know 200 megs of memory XML

136
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,330
eased you refer back references a few
kilobytes of excellence like growing

137
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,470
with the big easy way to eat up a lot of
service resources again

138
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,280
reusing the XML XML code that I had
earlier basic same idea just dumped in

139
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,439
the attack payload lot of repetitive
rinse wash repeat get more coffee

140
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,440
service areas where they want to make me
write new films

141
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,230
another attack is the back attacks where
these are who's familiar with the back

142
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,500
denial of service attack the WordPress
that was fun meeting someone worth

143
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,560
recite obviously didn't they don't
validate who was saying that they posted

144
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,219
opposed to but they do make the request
to check that the person is there a

145
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,740
bunch of WordPress SETAC say yeah like I
have a list of a hundred increase in

146
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,190
trying two hundred WordPress sites on
the internet for a couple thousand

147
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,570
there's not ten thousand

148
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,820
address I tell ya we all you know
google.com just totally linked to you

149
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,640
and then the requesting google.com and
yahoo.com will get a flood of requests

150
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,630
from not who the attack original
originating attack source is another way

151
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,760
to do this is kind of fun you can use it
as a network scanner same

152
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,460
recycled exact same code that I was
using before as well and he's been back

153
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,380
attacks obviously detecting dunno source
it reopened it being in and out so it's

154
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,640
kind of funny ass but it to do that
turns into a network scanner is pretty

155
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,340
interesting you just seem to the host
and port for the

156
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,940
the domain name that you thinking back
to this and you wait for this to be the

157
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,490
timeout request to see if it's a really
quick response that means at ports

158
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,850
probably open on the internal service
does it require spending back with this

159
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,700
is an issue to be with you doing it's
really slow response then you can

160
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,110
download it at that point probably isn't
open because it's out there waiting for

161
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:17,970
the time out so again you just recycled
old code is pretty easy to like recycled

162
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,120
code dump it in making attacks
everything's peachy hunky dory get the

163
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,550
guy said puppies and pumpkin spice
lattes by the end of this topic on

164
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:35,540
public space loyalties but getting into
when I called snowy anybody know what I

165
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,730
mean by when he calls me something
smells funny so it's you know bathroom a

166
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,490
room this morning

167
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:48,160
know basically smelling something looks
off something that's weird like to call

168
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,819
it funky like something's fucked here
but I don't want to put up here so just

169
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,950
beyond those they remember to pay for
the record soundtrack is a fucking all

170
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,250
the time

171
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,770
authentication authentication is a CBE
they came out this actually came pretty

172
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:14,630
slow about a year after the CD came out
as WordPress he said I think

173
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,380
everything's verbiage of it should have
the slide of it but it was really

174
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,140
indirect was like yeah when the user
click logout they don't actually get

175
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:28,189
logged out you can tell it doesn't
delete the cookie in the browser and you

176
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,900
can just if you have had that he saved
you just regenerated or basic put it

177
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,110
back on the browser using the candy
cookie manager software and it still

178
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,640
works it could be always works no matter
how many times you click logout that

179
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,430
cookies always valid it was a big thing
they're like oh session replay or

180
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,449
something like that you know if the
deleted it still valid and somebody else

181
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,700
could log in but they didn't seem right
to me and it seemed like there was all

182
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:55,140
that was there to keep taxes low
Firesheep is part of the top 10 so

183
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,910
really if you really have no reason to
fuck that

184
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:06,630
but I can look into it just seemed like
that was all that was there because it's

185
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,350
been a year since the CD yet been
released before I came across my desk

186
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,890
and this is likely something that I know
nobody was freaking out about into Reno

187
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:20,449
logos and custom websites about it
sounds like harry let me look into this

188
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,760
and actually at the time to look into it
and waiting just like quickly make a

189
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,530
test in be done with it sorry digging
into a meeting in an enlightening

190
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,470
released yet the notes I could find was
facing the developers in the WordPress

191
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,580
theme that we're going this is more
complicated than you can do we can't

192
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,660
just thinks it like that like you
recommended patch they had a patch like

193
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,130
somebody committed to their svn repo
rate will just do it the way you don't

194
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,560
understand it and people would actually
I actually contacted him and said hey

195
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,880
this is still valid why is it so low is
pretty bad vulnerability you know we're

196
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,330
caesar's don't tend to think to use
secure wifi but that's not our faults

197
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,860
not real vulnerability they should be
using HTTPS instead they yeah all you

198
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,190
say is you can't figure out off or
session and everybody has to pay for

199
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:14,940
certain they were saying it wasn't there
follows users well so we can get to dig

200
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,630
into its only going you know walk to the
process but I found it they dug into it

201
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,550
and this is really really in-depth not
just replacing code but at rewriting my

202
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:30,650
own vulnerability and ending up the
attack surface against WordPress over

203
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:36,380
about a year's time is what this took so
I considered it came on they said they

204
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,020
just tell me if I come if I came to the
message of sessions are broken they like

205
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,150
this isn't sessions you don't know what
you're talking about these things like

206
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,920
you guys exact answers so this is this
is this is it I asked her basically

207
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,579
WordPress is the address something
underscore is the cooking in the past is

208
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,660
obvious and then there's this value down
here the admin and then what is if you

209
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,199
look at it right it's a day at a time
stamp sets the standard Unix epoch is

210
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,940
Magic Valley

211
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:13,829
so let's get cooking in his whose name
is off and we had to generate that this

212
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,230
is this is hardcore stuff you'll never
be able to get it so hold on to your

213
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:26,490
panties if often he's defined basis like
hard values it is not define define it

214
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,470
as WordPress underscore that cookie yes
what does this magic cookie right this

215
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:36,190
is a global PHD's cookie has 281
whatever it is never be able to figure

216
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,100
that out here it is

217
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,719
here's what here's where it gets out
options that you also get the site's URL

218
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,840
handy fight it hardcore stuff gas
everybody's understanding what's going

219
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,129
on here so that I could yesterday never
gonna be able to figure out because he

220
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,850
believes secures an indy five of the
site's name I don't even know what type

221
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:03,429
of security that is they get the
terminology again is something that has

222
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:09,160
an idea security I will be sure to sign
up as the first person in line for

223
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,290
WordPress security like WordPress
developers secure Developer

224
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,810
certification because of this is the bar
I'm good I'm defied that they'll never

225
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:25,200
notice a team has to Indy 500 I so that
was easy

226
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:32,130
back to the cookie path to talk about it
that was an attempted anything and it

227
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,000
was a bad attempt so I can make fun of
it should be but it's good to that value

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,810
so I told you the first first part means
obviously separated by pipes

229
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,600
first part of this meeting do like PHP
object like a serialization here so I

230
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,889
can pretty much breaking apart by
looking at it

231
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,830
username time since that's easy magic
value magic value that's that's that's

232
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,500
the key to get into magic valuing values
generated going to start seeing what was

233
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,210
going on and why why is that these
cookies are being able to be replayed

234
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,480
why is it so impossible for the
WordPress developers to go play a patch

235
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,890
which seemed like a reasonable patch and
why are they using sessions in a

236
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,550
database like every other sites on the
Internet

237
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,860
ABC manager sessions properly because
then you can destroy and create and

238
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:26,379
destroy sessions the logic for that
magic values and pluggable files and

239
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:32,000
WordPress include functions generally
generate off-key four lines of code

240
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,590
basically again

241
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:41,820
paintings House Flag is a substring of
the user's pass password so it's after

242
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,629
the 8th character four digits after the
8th character will come back to this at

243
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,690
the end this extra credit for those of
you in the audience that already knew

244
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:57,790
where the factory is the key is
generated by using this function and

245
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,250
sending us some information PC user
logon type the past flag which is an

246
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:08,080
unknown user logins noon as unknown the
pipe character exploration is known as

247
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,879
actually controlled in the cookies value
and then scheme so we don't know is so

248
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,940
far past bragging whatever this WP hash
function does so that's alright again

249
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,820
this is the leader in pluggable though
he had data that's what we know is being

250
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,240
passed we have almost all the data
except that pass frag scheme is awesome

251
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:36,120
thank you babe I defaulted on its
assault of DBP salt from the ski alright

252
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,929
and the returns in each Mac using every
five of the data using salts that's

253
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:48,830
that's awesome they're getting their
butts WP salt movie Salt

254
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,750
skipping ahead here is there could
result convoluted to validate if it

255
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,540
exists in the database that basically WP
salt for ninety percent or more of

256
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,990
WordPress sites out there is pulls the
strings from WP config file for various

257
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,030
keys so all the secrets all the keys are
located in ninety percent of WordPress

258
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:14,350
sites for performance purposes it's in a
file called the VP config file to be

259
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,699
configured anybody's worked with
WordPress website all the values in this

260
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,460
are you need to fucking change this if
you don't change them then there you

261
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,280
know what the value

262
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,920
and its you need to fucking change this
nevermind the fact that this is where it

263
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:34,310
gets kinda weird and there's a little
bit of fuckery missus is there the

264
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,010
values that they don't exist here
they'll generate them and put them if

265
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,700
they were blank they put them in the
database and they probably should

266
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,700
automatically generate them and dumped
them into the database for you for some

267
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,080
reason his room

268
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,929
perform its purposes they really
reliably really want people to dump them

269
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:54,200
into this work was complete file which
way that's a bit of the problem here

270
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:03,670
anyways we know that resulted in on
going back to that four lines understand

271
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:12,470
that I just walk to use all three in
four minutes past her track meet is an

272
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,850
unknown but we know it's part of the
user's password hashes just the secret

273
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:23,270
salt from the WP config file with the
Indy 500 that's how you get a mickey and

274
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:27,650
they just use hashish make all over
again another 85 using the user login

275
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:33,210
expiration the key the key was facing
the hash so they will we don't know

276
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,630
here's the key but we can get it if he
knew the password fragment and the

277
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,930
secret vault the timestamp is known as
it's part of the cookie

278
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,630
busy jam all that into a couple of
hashish maximally fives Pune generated

279
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:57,410
by the cookie is a value was generally
indicated you don't have to pass any

280
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,090
validation that you knew the password at
any point in time on this thing you

281
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,290
don't have to go through the user like
login process if you have this cookie

282
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:12,020
you are in so I talked about us four
characters the password using substring

283
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,650
there's a final is only four characters
that's really what the crepes is here

284
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,810
the secrets also absolutely unknown but
there's ways to forgive us if there's a

285
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,139
way cities those out of sight and the
timestamp is absolutely known and

286
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,550
controlled so what I did his name when I
first looked in this took me a couple

287
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,889
weeks in my free time and I just piece
together a post office post compromise

288
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,290
so if they get all of this data was
kinda weird compromise scenario is

289
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,830
already broken into the site and get all
the data we want but it's gonna need to

290
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,750
say I only got until the day I want but
I'm gonna do is run this code messages

291
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,160
dumps everything opposed in your config
files I know all your secrets and they

292
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:58,340
promptly set an expiration date myself
told by me and I all this does is run

293
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,830
through the user IDs foresight and
generates a valid off token that expires

294
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:09,310
in a hundred years from the time that I
wrote this code which is 2013 expires in

295
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,389
a hundred years and I say whatever like
I can walk away and as long as you

296
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,230
didn't like evidence of the compromise
you'll never know how I'm logging in as

297
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,980
I'm always getting back in cause I have
all your secrets we had a generative out

298
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:28,310
so it gets and you'll never see anything
in the attack logs that has a valid

299
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,159
attack that happened this is just like
the admin login in fact if you look at

300
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,820
the admin was already logged in you look
to the logs great features the admin

301
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,139
accessing the site

302
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,580
doing what are delicious delicious
activity so make it really difficult for

303
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,260
forensics to ever forget what the fuck
is going on because again said no auth

304
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,940
process was taking place it's just the
eighth somebody trying to access the

305
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,720
admin panel just did everything they
wanted to do these things and I did a

306
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:00,160
blog posts in 2013 and he noted the CD
was from 2012 so here after this he came

307
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,400
out and was immobile I released this and
they talked to them and I said I warned

308
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,620
him I was going to do anything they
honestly I didn't care

309
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,320
re you know all the puppies and pumpkin
spice lattes in the world they didn't

310
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,450
make up for it or they didn't come up
pouring into the office that david has

311
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:22,240
seemed like nobody cared so I like the
month madonna just decided I wanted to

312
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,490
the fuck some more around with this so
it will be 1222 show them that this

313
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,960
could be a potential attack because
there's there's some critical failures

314
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,350
here's all you needed was a secret salt
this result is that is the key that's

315
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,459
the big data but I'm never gonna be able
to really get approved force but that

316
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,960
four digits of a password and probably
brute force reasonably fast way to get

317
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,990
this would be a school I

318
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,240
database to get a higher level access
then but maybe only had a selector maybe

319
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,200
had access to the backup of the database
they rarely change the salt sea salt or

320
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,640
complicated thing for WordPress user to
change especially if they're but

321
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,059
especially in the WordPress config file
because then they have to open an editor

322
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,520
and their website

323
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,030
taking a bunch of characters that are
valid stream so file disclosure is also

324
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,070
right way to do this where that they had
a backup copy of it

325
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,639
backup copy of the website something
that didn't execute the PHP likely put

326
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,580
it back till day without swap file
anybody remembers the disconnect campus

327
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,850
ETF the debt swap file was the was the
crux many people didn't check for those

328
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,850
are even get repo asked in repose those
things those won't give you all the

329
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,510
files content and they will pursue the
PHP so boo me if you get that see result

330
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,820
he teased at that one little piece of
information then all that is relying on

331
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,350
these sites are not being generated
maliciously for care up to four

332
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,629
characters of these is password

333
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:58,100
up to four characters whose you're
familiar with upstream in PHP if you get

334
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,980
a string that say I did something of the
word password and it was an echo that

335
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,590
started after the ACE character password
is eight characters long and I want to

336
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,639
the next four characters with PHP
deterrence nothing if you did password

337
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,470
1234 and you did after everything after
the character returns the 1234

338
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,000
everything after the a character which
is really where the fault here was and I

339
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,860
think that was a huge site and the fact
that they made it completely forgot to

340
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,590
consider that most of the users probably
don't have any character password at

341
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:38,340
that so most of the users that secret
password part numbers of up to four

342
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,959
characters is probably nothing it's
probably an empty string so I know you

343
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,580
see your salt I'm just basically in so I
considered it mostly worthless who

344
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,879
considers that throng again if there is
a WordPress security cert like

345
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,360
developers like security by course I'd
be all over it

346
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,709
what does do random string you can
return 0 I don't care it's not try to

347
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,049
retrieve out over at the center to make
you more than 4 characters just four

348
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:13,309
characters not even the first four
characters so I concept on this again

349
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,059
it's really similar I said some basic
values exploration which I control the

350
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:21,670
entire time target domain some say
whatever user is admin so you have to

351
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,690
know the valid user which again

352
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,200
88% they always say don't use the admin
account eighty percent of them have an

353
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:35,220
admin account these statistics out of my
ass but they're pretty safe to say it's

354
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:41,910
eighty five percent off using another
vulnerability like

355
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,760
file inclusion fil disclosure so a file
disclosure can turn into force I

356
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,860
compromise in this scenario cooking game
again we need at indy five and 25

357
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:00,010
remember login just WordPress login
screen and give them the site name not

358
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:04,030
forget that I was that was the thing
that will never figure out the set the

359
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,668
target value is that this is the heart
of the code not really all that gets a

360
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:13,340
lot of code on the screen but mostly
because it's a bunch of nested for loops

361
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,760
as I start generating through every
potential character of those four

362
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,990
characters of these password

363
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:25,350
like I said the pool sizes pretty big
tits hurts like 64 goes up to 16 million

364
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:31,290
potential requests that are going to be
made and what it does ABC generators

365
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,730
cookie and it starts with an empty
string so chances are if they didn't

366
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,870
have a guarantee that their passwords
characters or less than first just work

367
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:46,290
think popped on that they are the first
it'll just work and the fragment was an

368
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:50,360
empty string and entering through the
Jets are all use a little more security

369
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,699
to all potential one character cases and
then to care but actually like the

370
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,270
Hollywood version of a password cracking
resource locking in characters not

371
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,150
really but should have done that in my
proof of concept of a concept is just a

372
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:09,380
pH restrain I forgot to mention the last
minute this it actually does the

373
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,070
the requests so sexy teen girl and then
makes the request to the website and it

374
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,790
respond and looks at the response to see
if there's evidence that that's a valid

375
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,740
login like you know the the Login link
at the bottom the WordPress a goes away

376
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,400
and becomes hello admin or something
like that on this basis but the actual

377
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,490
look like I should have been more
razzle-dazzle but into the razzle-dazzle

378
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,370
I just make the code that works there
should be a valid cookie this is

379
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,979
probably a valid key for one of my
websites want to get picture you find a

380
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:52,670
website that expires and they have the
Flash yeah it has been compromised

381
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,670
because I guess what the password is
password

382
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,270
you know how I got around that led to
factor on just by enabling two factor

383
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:06,240
auth all the all the tools they were
attempting to force password like they

384
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,290
actually drained the old school way by
admin and choosing passwords Raiders

385
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:15,530
China the old school way it was the
school news when they're trying to you

386
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,340
know VCC it and it hits the site to
punch like this is the normal before

387
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,179
suspect you'd see that all over the logs
as a bunch of post requests to the

388
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,310
WordPress admin page like login page the
WordPress login page bunch post requests

389
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:32,580
and this actually cause a huge problem
signaling because I get thirty about 30

390
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,699
minutes left and it's getting close to
the end so it's a standard before that

391
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,700
act against this happened about two
years ago

392
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:47,960
recalls that have a story about that
time so this you recall having its true

393
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:58,500
and this may or may not be true with his
lack of neurons drinking too much

394
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,290
kids don't drink so you wanna be waking
up the next day going to a talk and

395
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,700
having a straight talk

396
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:21,550
tell us what are the symptoms for
standard brute force attack against

397
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:26,300
WordPress sites is a huge thing that
happened a few years ago this has an

398
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,780
involvement on this because well I was a
one time somebody on Twitter added up to

399
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:39,310
something useful like wire by WordPress
login pages what is this guy seems

400
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,159
interesting so I actually wrote a
customized security rule that watched

401
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,360
for all these things like medicare my
WordPress sites into a little and it

402
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,889
would take the request and log all the
data so most sites in your ACP logs to

403
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:00,230
see post requests to WordPress login yet
another post back it's not like it

404
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,090
requests for its kind of part of the URI
string so you can use the values but

405
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,189
with my security and access to all the
data I cookie data post data all the

406
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,020
hidden data server response in Baba and
I wrote a tool my security that would

407
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,490
log all that to file so it would be your
request that were coming in he was

408
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,800
logging things will file so this is like
two and a half years ago just be given

409
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,190
some big time frame on it because he
didn't like what I wanna see what's

410
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:33,470
going on so long all the username and
password that they were attending

411
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,290
against my sites there's really
interesting information it was like ok

412
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,530
man was the password that they were
trying now to toe was a password that

413
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,480
they were trying to say I know who the
hell they think I M there is some BS

414
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,410
like to know security like that I just
found on all the time for like

415
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,010
validating Stephanie happen to have it
on the internet just a convenience

416
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,000
trying all these passwords and I'm
working at the time it was password but

417
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,950
I T better off in the other group forced
him to try that this culminated about

418
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:09,820
six months later from the little sweet
where I started collecting data like

419
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,349
this man

420
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:13,940
massive attack for some reason against
all WordPress sites and you wouldn't

421
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,418
notice like something called against
WordPress and it was it was funny

422
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:24,348
because any like boutique WordPress
hosts a large WordPress automatic

423
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:31,190
network thinks the really Pte hardware
was like fending off these attacks which

424
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,159
really just brute force it requests but
all the shared hosting providers it

425
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,210
turns out they they're they're hard was
probably a little less tuned properly in

426
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,809
a busy start going down there going down
hard

427
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:44,509
non work for sites are going down hard
because of WordPress site for getting

428
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:48,319
attacked it turns out the request that
WordPress was making to the database

429
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,699
query of the password was correct

430
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:54,049
was eating up so many resources that
just a standard brute force attack

431
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:59,210
turned into denial of service attack and
I'm sitting over here thanks to this and

432
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,470
I have the exact list of passwords that
they were trying cause I've been logging

433
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,759
in for like six months and then it just
simply ramped up its easy for me to make

434
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:10,289
a preventive measure for this cause I
could just black list of passwords

435
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:14,309
passwords most people have commented
something like that i three tries in

436
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:18,049
your how sort of scenario but they don't
like a firewall level where they saw the

437
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:22,390
same IP address key train hit a
wordpress site we kept failing the

438
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:27,739
ballot loggins they just block that IP
address for a little while to adjust all

439
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,249
right way to handle it but the
difference between that type of brute

440
00:35:31,249 --> 00:35:36,680
force attack in this type of brute force
attack is I had a cookie and your logs

441
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,190
are gonna look to see the cookie at all
all year long they gonna say is neat

442
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,599
looking at me and my script running into
a meeting request for your site's

443
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:49,749
path or your WordPress route and its
engineering work like this good morning

444
00:35:49,749 --> 00:35:54,019
just say never see it's a really slowly
as you go through each time though

445
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,769
however what I'm doing is I'm generating
about off cookie and I knew that off to

446
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:01,058
get my headers and I sent it to you and
i'm looking back to see if the response

447
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:06,809
has a little bottom says please login or
that please login says hello admin with

448
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:12,089
this he says hello admin don't stop the
cooking and come back later look at it

449
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:17,880
and there I got a valid off so i think
is pretty good me with a little bit of

450
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,400
sneaking some information I can generate
a

451
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,140
undertake

452
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:27,279
undetectable brute force tool that looks
like normal traffic breaking any

453
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:35,200
WordPress site anywhere in the world
right time to be the phrase that inhabit

454
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,410
I wrote a blog post on this I started
harassing the work force developers all

455
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,848
I got was a lot of my crash harassment I
think my boss is probably like are you

456
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:51,069
working on this thing really work Press
come on everybody knows I contacted

457
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:54,380
their security staff which is really
funny as I said I like paying attention

458
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,390
to this stuff and if they released two
security white paper for WordPress where

459
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,788
they say and I quote we have over 200
security developers that's a lot of

460
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:07,500
fucking developers we're gonna security
no fun they're doing but i guess its

461
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,490
developers man I was talking earlier
that course must be fucking hard did you

462
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,319
fill in your name rate maybe there's one
guy just confirming his name right now

463
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:19,319
he's accepted all of them is security
developer all 21

464
00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:26,400
implemented the detection for this this
vulnerability in our internal standard

465
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,730
AC effectively medically released the
code but we did release as proof of

466
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:35,450
concept nobody tremendously implemented
and there's it's PHP so I guess they

467
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:42,058
were kind of worried about it and
eventually he was 86 in 2014 when they

468
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,890
released version actually WordPress I
think four point to all I was left was

469
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,819
cold coffee and meat filling up my not
my now empty coffee cup of whiskey the

470
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:55,259
rest of the day to just go to sleep at
night knowing that this is how people

471
00:37:55,259 --> 00:38:00,269
sometimes take care of security really
care about security I got no praise and

472
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:06,160
we've done and that's just another day
in the life of security researcher but

473
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,328
everyone here thinks sometimes thankless
sometimes sometimes it's awesome in

474
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:17,660
great just bullshit but it's really fun
when he said around going I can break

475
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:24,848
into all of these sites but I cant cuz I
would be legal so many questions

476
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:28,329
thoughts and serves

477
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,690
watching the clock

478
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:45,369
he said i wonder the I get enough
caffeine I it's good 10 minutes twenty

479
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:50,800
but I was emailing the research I was
emailing the contacting the IRC like I

480
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,230
was sending US singles I know people in
the WordPress community lay ahead

481
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:01,750
friends yum I did Nick get email them
and they said I don't want to thats one

482
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,910
of the names of the people that
responded to me was like simpson's guy I

483
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:15,109
imagine I hope you made it he is the guy
and nobody gonna get stuck on this you

484
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,700
called it

485
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,609
sessions and it's not only shut me down
what's funny is I didn't actually

486
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:25,140
finally writing find the original CVE in
this at all before in me and I in the

487
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,000
blog post I write about it I do give
proper credit credit here just as I

488
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,260
forgot it but before me there is another
group of white oak security some sweet

489
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:42,859
renamed security they're the ones that
got the CBE validated by video DVDs I

490
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:47,720
would know it's exploding

491
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:54,560
derp coffees now functioning

492
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:03,930
cheers before me was them before then it
was this other guy who apparently his

493
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,990
brother is one of the WordPress
developers so like if through having a

494
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,919
CBE and having a security researcher at
Russell is right I was going to hell and

495
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,810
my contacts in like the VC get tired of
it

496
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:20,460
hearing of it by the time they got to me
there's a clock tracking go away

497
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,930
nobody's gonna actually compromises and
is mostly because the guys before me

498
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,270
gonna stop slow kinda stopped short and
I just kept ratcheting up every couple

499
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:34,770
of months I i release a little bit more
of a piece like a little bit of like the

500
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,650
seven-course dinner of me compromising
WordPress sites a little bit more of the

501
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,300
attackers a little bit more like
eventually go really bad until I see

502
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,040
that you actually fixing the eventually
fixed it by adding an ON switch is

503
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,660
stored in the database that's a value
that's a temporary value that's only

504
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,040
created in may involve to the time of
the cookies types of the time stamp

505
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,210
that's all he needed to do they really
need to do is have Valentines teams in

506
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,140
the database as well to generate nuances
just saying this is a valid I'm simple

507
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,100
one of the cookies for generating
everything's off the lake everything is

508
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,680
way off and one of the developers did
can get back to me and I remember his

509
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,279
argument that you mentioned earlier was
this just easy to BS not our fault that

510
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,940
they're not using HTTPS I'm like that's
a little later the other response was

511
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,880
you don't know how complex like how much
research overhead this is it would

512
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,890
destroy so many were no probably worse
that they're getting hacked that's using

513
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:36,319
a lot of resources and then the other
other one was that they did the resource

514
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:43,060
10 it was at this isn't an RFC just
follow the RFC RFC has its if it's wrong

515
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,790
it's wrong we're not run for following
the wrong RFC they'd like that who's the

516
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:55,110
bigger 44 following are the leading
leading care they just found ways to

517
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:59,850
divert it some of the people I talk to a
really useless some other people I talk

518
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,319
to your friends and going to work with
the community there were more

519
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,180
understanding of it all

520
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,669
aimed at giving talks about them I kinda
know how their chances they feel like

521
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,750
this can meet communities attacking them
to communicate security community feels

522
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,130
like they're ignoring them which creates
an animosity in soil water and they just

523
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,430
don't live together and I come as nice
as I can but this is what it is and look

524
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:27,779
what I had to do with proof of concepts
and I'm like I can break into sites all

525
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,790
day long as much as I want as long as I
can certainly they tease out this

526
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,509
information to give up parts are popping
sites and they won't carry tell what

527
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,520
basis they started doing that their
systems are winning because I to getting

528
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,160
popped and they don't know why that's
the fun and the question

529
00:42:51,120 --> 00:43:14,120
babies for their argument was that there
are other they're already in the

530
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,120
database is this argument

531
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:24,010
200 security developers man I argue
every one of them like like in this

532
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:28,030
battle of like an old seventies arcade
system gotta go to every fucking boss

533
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:32,960
gets you every level of the two hundred
security developers time at the like the

534
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,550
big boss and I compromise I'll share
what do you want me to do I based around

535
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,020
the corner he's its good knowledge I ran
out of quarters before I get through all

536
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,060
of them to really can make an impact in
my quarters I mean resources I don't

537
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,340
have the time to just keep operating in
to make it fixed all I can do is make

538
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:56,480
the blog post and hope that it catches
with somebody account shirt kinda like

539
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,450
back back room decisions and discussions
can clear my name is being jackasses

540
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:06,080
strategic talking about it called the
decision like the first title the first

541
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,480
blog post I did was call jamming with
WordPress sessions and they're like to

542
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,590
write like this guy doesn't know what
he's talking about we don't use such

543
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:18,050
terms of office sessions to get into
your site would you call it it's broken

544
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:25,210
so I see also be learned here just
another day enjoying life enjoying life

545
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:30,070
thank you all for waiters stakeholder
something because once talked to me also

546
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:35,720
end up in the plug on his own he say
that I guess your sleep is hiring so

547
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,430
nobody's here looking for work

548
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,569
hiring all sorts of stuff just how you
get the job site systems I don't even

549
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,700
know what everything we're hiring for
his it's also should not be a surprise

550
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,439
everybody insecurities hiring right now
everybody wants to be out of band about

551
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,160
more of this post these discussions I've
had with these pesky WordPress security

552
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,180
developers I can get quite animated

553
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,550
thank you
