1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,930
so we have two popular speakers coming
up next we have Matthew home a checks

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:13,419
and and Davao there have been talking
about smartphone security and privacy

3
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:18,190
for those of you in this room there's
also a lockpicking village presentation

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:25,000
and plenty of contests are going on
benders and sponsors on another deal now

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,230
ok good so please enjoy this song can
give you a big round of applause at me

6
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:47,909
I'm metrics on Twitter I have fancy
security alphabets for your t-shirts and

7
00:00:47,909 --> 00:01:11,270
I prefer a dozen fires 08 right now
among the japanese so it's going to be

8
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,130
about I'm gonna go ahead and just
preface it like this I'm not going to

9
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,579
talk about reversing hard we're not
going to be talking about playing with

10
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,119
the code I'm not gonna be talking about
anything that deep purpose of this talk

11
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,600
is actually to go ahead and look at
things that we're doing in our everyday

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,280
lives as far as not securing our devices
and this is here to go ahead and

13
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm gonna and this talk is here to go
ahead and help you take your privacy

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,429
back and secure devices

15
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:56,049
this is for the general public and this
is going to go ahead and cover couple of

16
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:02,159
the devices are major eyelash of course
Android and we're gonna talk about how

17
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,630
to go ahead and do things that might
inure previously as well as David will

18
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:18,340
be talking about the iOS Android privacy
granularity and I'll be covering that

19
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,420
it's important that you think about my
client are you using what carrier are

20
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:35,640
you on what you actually talk about the
advances in security devices and a lot

21
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:46,000
of the recent fails he thinks it's all
users trust your device would you

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,870
actually go ahead and do with it

23
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:57,389
yes we have the shrink wrap we go ahead
and the shrink wrap basically how do you

24
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,280
know that your device has not been
tampered with before you went ahead and

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,630
and cottage there's also a big issue
where we know that SIM cards have issues

26
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:14,609
with security so no matter what type of
device I guess I can't actually

27
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:20,459
guarantee the security due to the fact
that we have issues with the SIM cards

28
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,400
and of course David morning to take it
from here

29
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:33,020
just like take a moment to go over the
built-in granularity that the iOS has

30
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,820
built-in as of Iowa State and this
includes location services contacts

31
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,579
everything on that list it would take
too long to actually go through it all

32
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,720
but they've actually broken out the
privacy for what can access flood into

33
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:57,230
these categories and it only asks you if
if we can use this feature when the app

34
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,560
tries to use the feature so this isn't a
net install issue this is this is a ok

35
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,490
the app is now trying to access your
photos even know ask you can access your

36
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:13,480
photos and then you can always say no
and if the app just you know that just

37
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,149
has to deal with it for one because
Apple says it does and if you feel that

38
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,659
you need the functionality later you can
just easily go in and turn back on after

39
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,690
the fact and then they've gone one step
further for location settings and

40
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,550
they've actually giving you the option
you ever want this apt to ever know

41
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,460
where I am it's well using the app which
is only when the app is on the screen

42
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,820
and this is important and then there's
always which even if the app isn't

43
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,110
actively running again still no your
location for all the other settings is

44
00:04:47,110 --> 00:05:00,419
just on and off so easy mom can do it so
no matter what device using your device

45
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:06,080
has a potential to go ahead and spy on
you how do they do it there's a location

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:15,200
history and both eyelash as well as
Android devices for iOS you can go ahead

47
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:24,070
and turn off my cloud and of course uz
privacy and the haitian usage you can

48
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,240
also go ahead and

49
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,229
mass with them and reset your unique
identifier which is the advertising

50
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:39,719
ideas as far as the granularity and
privacy as far as Android device

51
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm actually not going to be able to
turn things on and off the only way that

52
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,240
I can go ahead and do this is to either
match with the Android code using

53
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,250
Android SDK and removing items out of
the mana fished which the stock is in

54
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,580
for people who probably would now have
to go ahead and do this who has time for

55
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,940
this problem is I have to sideload every
hour after rebuilding it and after

56
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,979
probably might not work

57
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:25,169
upgrades and can possibly not the
upgraded that's as far as Google spies

58
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:32,539
on you shame is sharing its voice and
audio so every time you do the OJ Google

59
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:39,310
or a sherry and actually sending it to
the cloud and they're trying to go ahead

60
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:47,349
and learn about your particular habits
have church history and web searches

61
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:52,400
YouTube and this applies on both devices
as long as you're using Google is a

62
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,909
cloud it doesn't matter for using an
iPad it doesn't matter if you're using

63
00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:02,009
Android and it doesn't matter if you're
using a Chrome browser all these things

64
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:07,159
are actually kinda turned on by default
and we all need to go ahead and make

65
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:11,770
sure that you look at it and actually
understand in turn off these settings

66
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,340
and this is more of the heart of the
talk as far as what we're talking about

67
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,830
on privacy inside of the end right out

68
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:27,650
you have an application is drawing will
get to that more eyes on you and it's

69
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,780
pretty pretty creepy because

70
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:37,469
it has a history of everything and minds
clean but if you actually don't bother

71
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,460
to go ahead and go into your history you
can actually go ahead and Google

72
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,799
location history and search history and
you'll see things as far as everything

73
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,490
about your account you need to go ahead
and grab that back because by default

74
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,820
everything is on sale I'm watching
YouTube videos

75
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,960
catch while its gonna remember every
damn I saw

76
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:13,219
ever since I switched to a fanboy
anything it's awesome

77
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,030
use Google Maps and because I actually
went ahead and limited Google Maps

78
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,059
you only want to use it forgot where I
am it doesn't know where I am when I was

79
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,720
using my android devices I thought it
was pretty cool because I travel often

80
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,349
work and I kinda liked to frequent
places and I could just go into this

81
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:42,430
history thing where was I last night I
wanna go back there now that I had

82
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:46,739
internal that stuff I don't need the
convenience of them remember it all

83
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:56,760
figured out where I was a recent article
came out in which you do not want to go

84
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:04,060
ahead and sell your Android device to
anyone because apparently Android device

85
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:11,160
it is not properly encrypted happens to
have a persistence to it you'll see at

86
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,490
the bottom there I actually had a
Motorola Xoom I gave that away but it's

87
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,570
always going to remain in my account is
a newt the encrypted device fortunately

88
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,240
you can't piece it back together because
it had asked to be in there that's

89
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,820
always going to sit there and my Google
account

90
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,680
charges decides to go away on its own
when you are selling a device

91
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,279
when you do go ahead and switch clouds
and everything else make sure you remove

92
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:48,370
your accounts from devices on the web
interface as well as encrypt your device

93
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:55,360
and then go ahead and run a new because
the difficulty is there's persistence

94
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,380
bits stick around and while the only way
you're going to go ahead and that

95
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,380
Android device is FDA then wipe

96
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:15,940
I'm gonna let David illustrate some of
the United settings and there's here but

97
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:24,580
so on iOS if you want to limit what
exactly what apps have access to you go

98
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,690
into the settings you click the little
market called privacy right there and

99
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:35,570
you figure out what exactly you want to
check on say location services and then

100
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,180
it gives you a nice list that shows you
every single app that has ever asked to

101
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,099
use locations and you can and this is
what I was talking about earlier where

102
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,000
you can tell it

103
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,620
example the up Sorkin never tell where I
am because why does the App Store need

104
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:01,800
to ever know we're in and singles for
AT&T scanner the camera I actually like

105
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,069
to know where I took the pictures but
then sending pictures to anyone so just

106
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,700
be aware that your camera does save your
location when you take a picture on an

107
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,230
iPhone unless you turn this off so if
you're trying to be sneaky just make

108
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:25,450
sure this is turned off before you take
the picture on Android on the other hand

109
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:31,329
well we went hunting for it and maybe it
was an abscess

110
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:38,769
and ok so list of apps and and you know
that that's great we got the store in

111
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,519
her ass profile manager and
authenticator that that's good ok so

112
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:52,160
does it have ok let's hear this may cost
you money this read my text messages and

113
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,049
this has been brought up in a lot of
talks before but Google doesn't seem to

114
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:05,999
really care about about granularity and
insecurity why does my photo app need to

115
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:11,829
be able to record audio you know I'm
sure it's only specific displaying

116
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:12,628
photos

117
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:17,999
this is a question for the app developer
which in the end has all of the

118
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:23,369
permission to busy request whatever
permissions it wants and you will only

119
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:29,350
be asked once about this and that is
when you install the application or

120
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,089
updated if the permissions have changed
often what they do is often what what

121
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:41,549
what has happened when you actually is
pretty innocuous when you get version 1

122
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:53,790
I end up getting its version 1 I work at
the manifested it's like okay i text

123
00:12:53,790 --> 00:13:00,219
messages cuz it's like a text message
message maybe I might wanted to go ahead

124
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,489
and access matters

125
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:08,470
initially agree because it's like it
saying I only want to access your photos

126
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:17,199
and the ability to send SMS MMS I'm
caught that all of a sudden two weeks

127
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,459
later

128
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:27,199
and that it has a hold a manifest in
there and trike what I was cool the

129
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:33,498
other time before is not necessarily the
case now because now I want access to my

130
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:47,540
GPS wants access to my contacts what
access to all that stuff and the other

131
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:53,379
thing is that like I was saying earlier
you can modify the manifest until it no

132
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:57,339
you don't have access to this and then
side of the act but now you're getting

133
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,600
to this whole thing we're gonna update
itself so you every time in new version

134
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,240
comes out you will have to go and make
that same change inside loaded again and

135
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,939
that time that where you're not up to
date as we all know can be a serious

136
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:22,368
security problem getting back to the
whole the whole issue earlier other

137
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:27,240
considerations have to go ahead and do
when you're selecting actual mobile

138
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,779
device just because I bought an iPhone
doesn't necessarily mean that I have to

139
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:38,429
use iCloud iCloud actually don't the
only thing that I have turned on on

140
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:44,899
there is fine my phone you don't have to
turn every damn thing on and you don't

141
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:51,509
have to go ahead and and give it all
those draft accesses I actually use

142
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:58,790
Google for most of my apps and most of
my cloud on the actual iPhone because I

143
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,829
was an Android user before the court
thing is I can actually tell the office

144
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:09,939
now no I don't want you to go ahead and
access because I can do it

145
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:19,040
checkbox checkbox the Android apps that
I used to have and i dont have the all

146
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:27,870
or nothing that unfortunately his head
and pushes on me shall I use our club

147
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:34,799
iCloud I don't use it at supper Find My
iPhone and Microsoft has actually been

148
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:41,629
doing pretty decent advances as far as
their cloud with the 365 drive as well

149
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:50,299
as the outlook and also like box because
actually gone ahead and integrated the

150
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:55,439
biometrics into my box account for my
fingerprint reader and I think that's

151
00:15:55,439 --> 00:16:05,009
pretty pretty cool she'll go ahead and
take into consideration because when you

152
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:14,819
look at specific clouds box actually a
serious type 2 which is equivalent to

153
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:20,919
banking cloud storage actually kinda
like you and it's pretty pretty decently

154
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:29,449
done so by time you go ahead and store
something into the crowd actually be

155
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:35,359
mindful which actually putting it on
because otherwise you got other things

156
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:47,209
happening as far as as far as coal
carrier are you what carrier are you on

157
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:56,740
recently Verizon people actually finally
caved in and allow you to opt out of the

158
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,769
shipper cookie because most of the
Privacy Act of this went ahead and

159
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:07,579
basically hammered the crap out of their
customer service I did too I'm actually

160
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,908
quite happy that I can opt-out now on
Rizon agency is still unknown as far as

161
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:19,189
these sugar cookie track team and
t-mobile unknown as well as friends if

162
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:25,329
anybody knows it be awesome but haven't
seen anything in their use or anything

163
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:32,210
to go ahead and allow you to go ahead
and opt out of that show even if they

164
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,480
are going to happen

165
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,039
looking at your traffic you don't have
to go ahead and play along and play

166
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:44,080
along willingly and nicely better things
for going ahead and using privacy is

167
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,939
make sure that you know I hadn't get
yourself a VPN how many people are

168
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:58,740
actually on the wifi at this hotel right
now how many people are actually tunnel

169
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,299
in there there traffic as are smart
people

170
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,480
you have to go ahead and think about
this as far as my mobile carrier why

171
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,100
should I go ahead and trust them there
are no better than anybody else and

172
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:18,770
encapsulating tunnel traffic it's much
better that way

173
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:27,180
tell my my choices are actually a few
favorite VPNs ACP on which is really

174
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,770
really journey and I can't actually use
it actually can complete consumer

175
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:37,990
transactions blacklisted everywhere but
it's awesome for fenders and recently

176
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,480
I've been using private Internet access
which is pretty cool you can go ahead

177
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,830
and take any gift card and pay these 49
bucks where annual fee and pretty

178
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:58,340
anonymously do things and david Choi
slow is Viper be bpm

179
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:06,139
it's not quite as I guess secure as
you're not trying to hide your personal

180
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,440
information with this that you have a
lead en or that you're paying for VPN

181
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:19,720
this is more for ease of use it is a
fast and really secure VPN that is busy

182
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,040
getting you through whatever your
network whatever network you're in and

183
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,760
two straight into you know the include
without having to worry about your

184
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:38,360
carrier or whatever wifi Iran and and
because it has happened it's very easy

185
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,649
to use you know Mom can use it and it's
very reliable and it's fast enough to

186
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:50,540
stream Netflix through it so it's
basically hey I just want to be safe in

187
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,190
my communications

188
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:03,760
so what should you be using so there are
a couple of apps that have been really

189
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,310
good with security lately and these are
ask that you should absolutely have or

190
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:23,030
at least check out signal is very good
at Moxie Marlins like what it is is it

191
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:31,030
uses open wish her and whisper system
that you actually have and an encryption

192
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:40,940
for each found if I call him or he calls
me actually has an occasion just like

193
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,540
the black phone does

194
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,530
words I say one uses one better match
have been meddled

195
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,100
signal is actually free for iOS it's
been around for the Android platform

196
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:01,629
under under reg phone and Sakura text
for quite a long time and it was funny

197
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,900
because I actually have the same number
reported over from my android found to

198
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:15,640
the to the Iowa actually I've seen this
phone number four was relatively

199
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,400
painless to go ahead

200
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:27,170
I've been playing with app called bureau
it is basically encryption method which

201
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:33,440
uses pgp which has a public and private
G but what they've done and done

202
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,800
actually made it's it's just as easy as
logging into Google it gives you a pass

203
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,700
phrase and it allows a factor
authentication I'm actually texting back

204
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,650
and forth I know that there's been both
a public key and a private I currently

205
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,220
don't have the app yet i've been waiting
for it but actually when I hadn't shot

206
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,240
on somebody else's device and it looks
very very promising for password

207
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,460
management I've evaluated trip it's a
simple tool to remember important

208
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:17,860
passwords and it syncs with box Dropbox
and one drive some of the clouds are

209
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:25,330
there I can go ahead and trust and my
passwords relatively secure generates

210
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:34,159
random passwords pretty good for Android
for my password management I still will

211
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:45,270
use open in 10 it's pretty good the wifi
password I would go ahead and use as far

212
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:52,980
as a nice new applique mout is a
brilliant idea called burner and what it

213
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,800
does is it's actually on steroids I can
go ahead and this is not for you to go

214
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:09,330
ahead and actually you to make illegal
things but it's nice when I want to go

215
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,449
ahead and like I want to sell something
on Craigslist I want to buy a car

216
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:23,810
house burner allows me to do is buy a
number that is burnable five minutes by

217
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,480
taxi

218
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,429
and it allows me to go ahead and virtual
number which I found sense tax my phones

219
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:36,580
but the number dies after 30 days if I'm
in the market to go by

220
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,809
usual am gonna buy the car and then all
these advertisers and marketers are

221
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:49,860
gonna get a hold of my phone number with
this as soon as i buy the car burned and

222
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,178
the number is gone forever and I don't
really have to deal with these people

223
00:23:53,179 --> 00:24:00,549
have been doing private you have to go
ahead and consider who you're giving

224
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:05,290
information to just as well as your
entrusting your data to you in the cloud

225
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:14,090
as far as if you are using iOS with
another person I messaged fishing off

226
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,809
the fed's recently if they're not happy
I think I'll continue to use of things

227
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:36,730
alright david talked about the well so
as far as advanced as in smartphone

228
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:43,340
security one really great thing about
recent iOS is that it is doing hardware

229
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:49,699
encryption whether you want it or not
it's built into the device itself and

230
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:57,860
its it works with as little as a four
pin he and well before panky itself is

231
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,320
what was that device

232
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,320
it kept cutting the power to keep trying
over and over again

233
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,179
yeah don't use a key but your data
itself is encrypted our box which is

234
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:21,980
fantastic and with the newer devices it
it is full device encryption device like

235
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,509
the sixes to not use a past Fraser
password you can actually use your

236
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:37,720
fingerprint and speaking like that
Android has attempted with their

237
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:45,320
lollipop relation to go ahead and
provide the device encryption one of the

238
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,980
things that drove me absolutely batshit
about dealing with Android and iPhone

239
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,429
device encryption is I turn on my phone
in a minute and a half later it finally

240
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:02,870
on school itself and encrypted itself
show its software based justly full

241
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:11,580
device encryption including an sdcard
but none of the coming within a few more

242
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:23,470
expensive phone exactly as far as
encryption

243
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,039
because once again its casino government

244
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:35,830
the other thing is they kinda lied and
the passion of the Android lollipop they

245
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,529
were going to say that when you got the
device out of the box it's going to be

246
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:46,230
encrypted you actually have to go into
your security settings and enable that

247
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:52,830
after you've heard after you should have
been so it's not exactly automatic you

248
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,850
actually have to be thoughtful about in
their show if we do have an Android

249
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,129
device please check your security set
because you don't have the voice

250
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:06,908
encryption turn on unless it's
specifically Android doing the

251
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:07,720
encryption

252
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:20,570
since I hadn't talked fails encryption
is not enabled out of the box I'll ask

253
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,799
encryption of the box but unfortunately
it gives you four digit span four digit

254
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,330
pens are not good

255
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,820
there's absolutely no reason to go ahead
and use one once again because of the

256
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:44,450
actual perpetrators in modern-day founds
another fail well if I'm in a 65

257
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:51,390
fingerprints actually were accessible
option unfortunately were not encrypted

258
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:58,020
I don't necessarily know I'm going to go
ahead and trust my fingerprints that

259
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:08,030
device looks like I'm picking on Android
they're actually 1228 vulnerable

260
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:15,399
applications in an Android as far as a
freak vulnerability yes that also is

261
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:25,490
about probably about 200 apps in the App
Store for iOS iOS does not actually it's

262
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:32,640
clean and security either had a failure
recently to you by firing denial of

263
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:40,110
service attack you get within range of
WiFi signal basically causes your

264
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:47,080
constant reboot tell you can actually
run away or drive away enough miles so

265
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,418
you can actually control your found you
make it stop arming itself

266
00:28:53,290 --> 00:29:00,899
and then the most biggest we were
talking about this as far as I get a

267
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,140
black found should I get a blackberry
should I get there should I get that

268
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:10,750
well it doesn't really matter because we
just found out that all the SIM cards

269
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:19,190
everybody has the encryption as far as
nation states and SIM cards by

270
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:24,940
themselves or compromise that's carrying
your data in motion and honestly when

271
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:35,850
you're gonna get pops it's all about the
data in motion the says where do I even

272
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:44,129
start you guys this is your fault and
and I think more any anybody that is

273
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,390
here at this conference it is completely
your fault that this is happening we are

274
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,450
not educating people about the security
we are letting them by phones and

275
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,980
devices in these things they put all of
their information in and it's not secure

276
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,090
and other information is being spread
everywhere and you know what they don't

277
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,129
care and they don't care because they
don't understand what they are what they

278
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,840
are losing what they are giving up so
how could you let this happen

279
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,240
professionals in the computer security
field and general public

280
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,250
how can you give them all of this
information and let them just do

281
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,620
whatever they want with it and just
throw it everywhere and put it on all

282
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,860
these clouds and in all these devices
that anybody can get to and be malicious

283
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:39,409
with so this is a false and yes oh
please oh please start talking to people

284
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,300
about their security I know you are but
we need to step it up a notch because it

285
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,270
is getting to the point where it is too
late

286
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:53,250
almost to step back and get our security
line then educate the general about

287
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,750
their privacy

288
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:08,830
I'm traveling all the time and market
their wallet but they leave their actual

289
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:20,750
phone unlocked at the bar watching my
stuff take everything else that could be

290
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:32,890
pretty cool as a chance to go and talk
to people sometimes I really shouldn't

291
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:44,190
you usually get and what happens when I
suggest something actually go why should

292
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:50,310
I do it because I have to do is look at
the sludge prints on your screen and a

293
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:56,600
better user four numbers and I guess how
did you know that like it's just obvious

294
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,669
you need to go ahead and it is a
teachable moment for folks actually

295
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:08,980
don't know any better as far as our
security and a security professionals we

296
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,100
should be teaching these people we
should be talking about this and I

297
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,330
thought that this was a good place to
actually go ahead and talk about this

298
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:24,100
week ahead and deal with it on a
consumer level instead of actually going

299
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:35,120
into the bitch the hardware or anything
else to the compromise solution it was

300
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,550
actually mentioned in the rising DVR
reports that to this state have detected

301
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:51,409
absolutely no breaches caused by any
mobile devices while least they haven't

302
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,670
seen him and then we have a conclusion

303
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,849
1 I'm protecting against and what this
whole talk about is is is grabbing back

304
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:11,599
your data as a consumer making sure that
you don't go ahead and and basically

305
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:17,718
throw everything ridiculously on the
cloud and everything else but if you're

306
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:21,249
super paranoid don't piss off the
nation's

307
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:31,258
don't want to use a smartphone but there
are things that can be done as far as

308
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:38,149
dealing with consumer thing you can
definitely go ahead and limit your

309
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:44,069
exposure Android one of the other ways
you can go ahead and bring back

310
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:52,589
granularity in a control X selloffs
hesitation that I have about using Excel

311
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:58,299
offices have to root the damn phone to
make it work and what happens if I

312
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:07,609
accidentally leave my wifi on and that
thing is really don't like the fact that

313
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:12,659
I have to go ahead and disable a
security thing just to go ahead and grab

314
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:19,089
action-packed security they need to go
ahead and fix that assures Android we

315
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:22,319
were going to go ahead and talk about
and evaluate others

316
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:28,399
Pacific phones like the windows and
other things that we just didn't have

317
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:37,949
alternate I'm powered through all the
slides and times BlackBerry still

318
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:47,949
affords you that ability as far as every
single lap down down

319
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,929
contacts can be locked down for one
problem

320
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,659
sure blackberry that I find useful

321
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:05,810
what's the point of actually having to
get anything done what's actually gonna

322
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:12,350
come up within the horizon and future
david's right it's our fault

323
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:21,100
purity practitioners these developers
actually other people some type of

324
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:28,799
accountability into how we develop the
action putting things together and David

325
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:38,330
comments thoughts right now so the the
tale of this talk with smartphone

326
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:44,670
security for the general public and so
right now as it stands if my mom comes

327
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,920
to ask me what phone should I get I'm
going to tell her to get an iPhone and

328
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,030
then I'm going to go over that iPhone
and and go through the security settings

329
00:35:53,030 --> 00:36:01,220
and turn everything off and show her how
to do it I just appalled at the toll

330
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:08,169
lack of care that Android has right now
44 these permissions and that's

331
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:13,170
basically something that Google has to
address and they've been told to address

332
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,780
this multiple times but I guess they
just really don't want to take a look at

333
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:22,520
it and do it and the weird thing is that
I do remember having an Android phone

334
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:31,080
and one time that had these permissions
but existence I'm not sure exactly what

335
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,330
happened there so

336
00:36:34,330 --> 00:37:08,270
you have any questions that we didn't we
didn't find any trace of that but again

337
00:37:08,270 --> 00:38:10,390
you're rooted congratulations to the top
11 plus when you said perfect actually I

338
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:16,100
think that it was breaking because it
was too difficult to implement

339
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,960
effectively with the android framework
or it was breaking news if you'd if you

340
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,700
go the routed past and you and you will
turn these permissions awful of him what

341
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,950
happens is the Apple launched a neatly
crash with the permission to Seattle

342
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:38,169
where with iOS in order to get into the
App Store you need to make sure that is

343
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,700
that something is turned off it doesn't
crash there is that

344
00:38:42,700 --> 00:39:29,259
at presentation but you're getting and
the answer in this case has no I mean

345
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,470
with with the Nexus devices you know you
can call an image directly from Google

346
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,689
and then you know if I trust what's
coming from Google that I'm good with

347
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:44,369
ones that come from your carrier I mean
they're so spotty with updates and you

348
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:49,609
don't know how the modified it and it's
just complete mess and even if you want

349
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:54,098
to if you want to reinstall the OS from
scratch

350
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:57,869
you know it's basically a crapshoot
whether you can even do that and then

351
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:00,869
your back to that I don't trust what I'm
being given

352
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:13,419
caches everything else do factory reset
maybe do it a few times and hope that

353
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:22,619
it's good actually another reason why I
actually have started to like more it's

354
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:30,490
called Jeff you may actually allows you
to see a signed version of the OS

355
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:39,200
essentially does is at the hardware
level i'm new juniors Jonathan just the

356
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:46,210
door she hadn't figured out every time I
do DFU and actually wipes clean

357
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:53,810
higher and higher device and rights over
it because it's basically operation it

358
00:40:53,810 --> 00:41:01,460
and trying the killing a key it's doing
all kinds of things basically if you go

359
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:08,030
ahead and do a few more times whatever
was on it if it was shrink Raptor

360
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:14,000
payload it's not there anymore I
recommend that you do that to your

361
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:35,440
device or the NFL out we all need the
NFL allowed access operations which is

362
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,480
basic revelation that people were
playing with things got into things

363
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:49,390
shrink-wrapped intercept the thing
before it goes to the store and then you

364
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:55,009
put it in the store and then your target
buys it so the other thing is if you are

365
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,980
buying consumer grade laptops and
everything else you should wipe those

366
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,510
things cuz Lenovo just proved that
anyways and the fact that they had I

367
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,770
were in their ass that's just awesome
that's what that is
