14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,790
growing trend of insurance companies

those of mine not my employer any
professional associates oh my company

18
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,479
doesn't really know I'm doing this so
let's try to keep it that way

19
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,929
thanks so what we will go over the
presentation

20
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,939
you know who I am overview of insurance
what the current offerings are for cyber

21
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,600
insurance but the current market is what
to beware of and also some advice on

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,600
whether to help decide whether cyber
insurance is right for your company so

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,408
Who Am I

24
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,940
professionally I'm in the information
security team for a financial services

25
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,890
insurance company so I actually work
with the business folks that create the

26
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,610
cyber insurance products so even though
I'm not necessary insurance background

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,090
person I do have I T and security
background so that's where we help them

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,500
understand the security problem

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,220
personally I'm originally from
Philadelphia anyone else in philadelphia

30
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,270
alright I guess I'm the owner up here
also a member of tools have you been to

31
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,750
the lockpick village I help you a lot of
these villages around the country that's

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:37,400
the kind of stuff I do find on the side
so what is the insurance in a nutshell

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,770
your insurance is the act of
transferring risk for distributing rest

34
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,730
across either group or to a company or
to another entity the earliest form of

35
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,450
insurance documented form of insurance
wasn't 3000 BC in China are and what

36
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,589
they did was it was very common for
people to transport goods through river

37
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,290
rapids on boats however with the choppy
water and the dangers of River river

38
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,049
rapids dare sometimes those boats make
it destroyed along with the cargo that

39
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,250
is on that boat so if a merchant where
the sent his goods down his but with

40
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,820
this boat across the river down the
river there's a risk that he may lose

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,260
his entire shipment so what merchants
started do was to distribute their goods

42
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,609
across each other's boats so if there
was ever one boat that was destroyed or

43
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,560
lost they would only use a portion of
their goods everyone would share in that

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,380
loss but it would not be detrimental so
that was the earliest form of recorded

45
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,540
insurance like activities now what
people generally think of insurance now

46
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,609
or insurance to each one of you

47
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,269
insurance is basically a promise to pay
when something bad happens you pay a

48
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,790
premium some amount of money to a
company there's a contract in place with

49
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,769
a policy where the promises you're
paying certain amount of money if you

50
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,170
were to suffer a loss that they are
promising to pay so this is an

51
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,149
interesting industry because you're not
paying for anything

52
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,110
product you're basically paying

53
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:15,820
three pumps and a claim is basically
just a request for a payout in the event

54
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,738
of a loss of course our processes to
prevent any fraud when their claims so

55
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,250
you know let's say you bought insurance
all the Sunnyside the smashes car into a

56
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,770
wall and try on purpose to get the money
there are other things that insurance

57
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:36,900
companies try to do to minimize fraud
any type of fraud insurance but now I'm

58
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,620
gonna go into a little bit the details
of how insurance works on the back and

59
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,550
one insurance company actually does to
write that policy for you so insurance

60
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,910
is based off of actuarial data and this
is you can think of this as a big

61
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,470
database it's a lot of data historical
data as well as any type of projections

62
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,730
they may have for things like auto
insurance life insurance insurance

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,820
companies have really really good
actually feels all you have to do is

64
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,840
answer maybe five questions and they
will be able to guess when you will die

65
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,770
with pretty accurate statistically
accurate estimation so it's it's kind of

66
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,120
scary and that's how they're able to
price their products so using that

67
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,070
actual data there's a process called
underwriting you can think of

68
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,950
underwriting as pricing a certain risk
if they want to offer product based on

69
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,300
that data how much is that risk worth so
they take that data and then to create a

70
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,000
policy out of that the terms conditions
how much it costs and there's a premium

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,190
supreme the money that you pay for that
transaction and the claims so you can

72
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,950
think of premiums as money going into a
comp insurance company and claims as

73
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,550
money going out of an insurance company
now it's about to get a little bit

74
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,640
businesses but there is a KPI are key
performance indicators for all insurance

75
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:08,599
companies called the combined ratio and
that's basically the the claims divided

76
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,310
by the premium so the idea is if it's if
it's over if the score is over 100 the

77
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,830
company is paying out more claims than
it is receiving premiums that makes

78
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,169
sense they're paying more

79
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:27,109
than the receiving so that's a KPI that
insurance companies have most insurance

80
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,819
companies actually pay out more claims
and they receive in premium pricing how

81
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:37,520
can how sustainable how are they able to
make money they they actually don't make

82
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,139
money off your premium the point of
insurance is not to make money off of

83
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:47,099
that because our pricing the risk and no
with a certain degree of based on their

84
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:51,330
actual day they know how long it will
take before a loss may occur

85
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,179
holding on to that money that entire
time and what do you do when you don't

86
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,240
have money just sitting around you
invested so insurance companies don't

87
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
make money off of premiums they make
money off of investments because they

88
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,990
know how long it takes for let's say if
you were to buy a auto policy for like a

89
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,150
Honda Civic they will say well
statistically based on our models you're

90
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,789
not gonna have an accident for six
months they can invest money for six

91
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:19,620
months and make a return on that and
it's ok if they lose a little bit more

92
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,800
money from claims that they're receiving
dreams that's perfectly OK and then of

93
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,399
course those claims data goes back into
that actual data for them to further

94
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:35,259
refine and make their models more
accurate the secret sauce to insurance

95
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:39,810
companies is the actual data and
underwriting there's a lot of common

96
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,960
kind of rule thousands of people may be
familiar with such as young males

97
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,239
between the age of 16 24 they're
invincible right or you know mary people

98
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,999
are born so they're less likely to do
risky activity there was a kind of

99
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:55,659
things that most insurance companies
know but there are other things that

100
00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:00,779
insurance companies may be able to dig
into actual data and figure out some

101
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:07,249
examples I have DUI insurance you know
if someone has had a DUI before some

102
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:11,860
insurance companies won't even ensure
them and if they do the prices and

103
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,949
astronomical however progressive was
able to figure something out they

104
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:22,009
realize that the people who have had one
dy there the safest drivers out there

105
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:27,360
cuz he will never do it again so they
can charge an astronomical amount of

106
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,589
money but protect themselves because
they know that this driver is going to

107
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:34,070
be well-behaved now if they get a sec

108
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,210
you I that's what they're saying hey
we're not gonna ensure you anymore but

109
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,950
they knew looking at the data that
people with 12 you I was going to be one

110
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,880
the safest drivers on the road and they
could make tons of money off that

111
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,710
another example that I think some people
may be aware of asbestos mining

112
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,590
insurance companies Action News that
asbestos was dangerous before there was

113
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,710
any scientific proof that they start to
notice that anyone working in a special

114
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:05,150
is mine was dying younger so they were
able to see that in the data some recent

115
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,880
things that insurance companies I
figured out some of this is really

116
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,000
obvious but they're able to verify with
data now the cost of hail damage for

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,600
certain zip codes were different even
though it's within the same state it

118
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,400
varied so what they did was day two
overlaid public meteorological data over

119
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,000
their claims data in the figure out that
based on where you are in meteorological

120
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,990
patterns that the hillsides varied and
hillsides over certain size cause

121
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,660
massive damage while health hides under
certain size did not cause damage so

122
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,180
they're able to price sale protection
much more accurately and also provide

123
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,280
our customers so the customer car
dealership buys insurance advice and say

124
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,250
hey you're in high risk is a coat you
may wanna put a roof over your your car

125
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,810
lot and then a recent one with David
piece of data that insurance companies

126
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,079
are some insurance comes to figure that
out of Hurricane sandy on the East Coast

127
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,870
storm damage was not dependent on the
size of building it didn't matter how

128
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,180
big the building was it it was
correlated to the frontage of the

129
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,939
building how much surface area was
exposed on the street because in New

130
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,050
York all the buildings are right up to
the next to each other so only the

131
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,130
surface area those exposed to street got
damaged so insurance companies

132
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,400
previously were pricing that risk based
on the size of the building how much

133
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,079
square feet

134
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,000
they were doing it wrong the whole time
so these little tricks that or things

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,930
that companies can look into the actual
data then create more accurate pricing

136
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,459
better risk advice to customers and also
protect themselves to

137
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:52,640
to make some money off of course I said
you success is minimizing exposure to

138
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,640
the risk paying out claims and also the
maximizing profit or the amount of time

139
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,680
they have the money to invest so that
cyber insurance not so with some of the

140
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,489
other insurances that you're you're
somewhat familiar with a lot of the

141
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,110
policies and terms are very similar

142
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,070
you know you you by an auto policy from
one company to another the terms are

143
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,410
very similar to what you can and can't
do

144
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:23,370
terminology is very similar with cyber
insurance company you go with every

145
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,710
company is going to offer different
types of coverage here are some examples

146
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,960
of some of the things they may cover
costs of regulatory proceedings you know

147
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,200
if you have to hire lawyers to defend
yourself against a regulator trying to

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,720
sync your business any disaster recovery
costs associated in the incident or

149
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,960
forensic response costs and you bring in
a mandiant or someone the policy will

150
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,720
pay for that pentagon policy credit
monitoring for customers if you have

151
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,560
some type of customer data breach and
even extortion some companies offer some

152
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,439
Russian hacker black males you the
company may pay pay for that extortion

153
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,170
the so they don't you are sure site or
something what's not covered course

154
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,810
negligence any non-compliance to
agreed-upon terms controls our

155
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,530
regulatory requirements and of course
any illegal activity

156
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,790
every insurance company terms and
exclusions will be different so it's not

157
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,740
like your auto policy where you go from
one company to another it's familiar

158
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,960
territory every companies can offer
something different so that's a little

159
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,500
scary

160
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,490
some of the key drivers of course for
the demand for this type of policy

161
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,020
lot of large purchase a republic now so
a lot of risk management teams the board

162
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,050
finance teams are kind of worried about
this too worried about you know their

163
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,819
company being on the front page of The
Wall Street Journal governments and

164
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,350
regulators are being more strict about
breach notifications and other types of

165
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,720
notification requirements and also this

166
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,980
obligations depending on what industry
you're in specific if you're working on

167
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,319
it if you are a subcontractor for
defense contractor and you do business

168
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,920
with that defense contractor they will
generally require you to have cyber

169
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,209
breach insurance contract the box say
hey you have this coverage or they will

170
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:22,209
not buy parts from you so there are some
industries where it's required I'm here

171
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:27,029
some data metrics showing you know the
number of reported breaches average cost

172
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,529
of a breach and also just how often
people googling cyber insurance vs

173
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:39,290
cybersecurity you can see there's a
major increase over last year's so

174
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,120
currently globally another metric
another business term gross written

175
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,459
premium is the number is the amount of
policy for pre-med as being collected by

176
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:54,489
an insurance company or in this case in
general the world are currently there

177
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:01,490
are there's two billion dollars being
paid in insurance insurance premiums as

178
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,649
compared to 2030 which is only one
billion so it is almost doubling year

179
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:12,040
after year to Lloyd's of London which is
one of the first insurance modern

180
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,029
Insurance Company does anyone know where
how when the boys was founded or kind of

181
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:22,660
the event that caused lloyd's we found
it you want the Great Fire of London

182
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,819
that burned down in half the city or so
that's when this company was formed to

183
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:29,819
start offering fire insurance four
buildings

184
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:37,059
maybe two three hundred years ago I say
maybe I'm wrong but it was during the

185
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:44,719
Great 560 ok sixteen hundred's they're
they're estimating that that cyber

186
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,069
insurance is potentially eighty-five
billion dollar market globally to put

187
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:55,529
that in perspective the entire USA auto
policy market is forty eight billion

188
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,480
dollars so all the money that everyone
in the USA is paying for auto insurance

189
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,050
adds up to forty eight billion dollars
and boys are estimating that it up

190
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,319
cyber insurance globally is a 85 billion
so that's a that's a mass

191
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,240
amount of money and PwC did recently did
a study and analysis and noted that

192
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,760
cyber insurance is growing specialty
lines of insurance ever in history no

193
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,069
other insurance products has grown at
the rate that cyber insurance has been

194
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:33,520
growing so the way that cyber insurance
is underwritten it's very very

195
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,470
rudimentary you basically get an
application you sell out here are some

196
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,410
simple questions are you PCI compliance
if you know if you process credit cards

197
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,240
do you have antivirus what kind did you
store do you analyze network traffic

198
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,480
these are literally questions from an
application any kind of based on those

199
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,740
responses you know if you don't answer
anything incredibly awful you know you

200
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,350
may be eligible customer they may decide
to do further analysis but not always

201
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,240
you may ask for a 10 test result hey
what's your most recent spent like to

202
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,810
review that they may want to review what
your disaster recovery plan is but not

203
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,969
always

204
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,810
and that's the extent of what they do to
understand how bad or how good your

205
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,989
company is with security and then of
course the result of all that they may

206
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:29,530
form the policy terms you know you must
do XYZ for us to cover you or yeah we'll

207
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,579
cover you but only for XYZ and only
under certain conditions so again the

208
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,120
policies can vary greatly from company
to company and even situation to

209
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,580
situation so some of you may be thinking
that sounds very crude how can you

210
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,200
understand whether security program is
gonna not based on do you have any fires

211
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,560
do you analyze network traffic

212
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,750
those are very binary yes-or-no
questions that don't provide a lot of

213
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,490
insight i mean there's really no no
insurance company has a really good

214
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,550
model on quantifying the cost of
security risk insurance companies are

215
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,040
actually working with tech companies to
do that AIG for example is actually

216
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,290
working with Mandy and to try to figure
this out there's very little actual data

217
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,699
available i mean there's some public
data such as you on the rise and I think

218
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,929
annual report semantics

219
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:26,879
his report but that data is not in a
very uniform format and it doesn't

220
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:33,559
really go into the level of detail that
you may need to quantify arrest you know

221
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:39,668
it's not a granular enough always the
question is also only provide insight

222
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:45,220
into how aids true program is designed
not nec- how it's actually being run a

223
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,789
penthouse me give you a little insight
into that but how exhaustive can append

224
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:54,669
SP I mean if you think about it we do
car crash analysis on cars medical

225
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:58,789
studies on illnesses and we do
environmental surveys for natural

226
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:03,299
disasters but we don't really do that
type of analysis for breaches and if we

227
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,080
do every company that doesn't announces
does it in a different way it's not

228
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:16,629
uniform so you're comparing apples and
oranges and as I mentioned social by

229
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:20,340
cyber insurance if you actually have a
say in in you know what your company

230
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,439
does in in the space to understand
what's being covered based on the

231
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,070
company you're you're talking and also
your company's really think about is it

232
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,549
really quite require what are you trying
to do I just trying to check a box again

233
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:37,519
do business with someone are you after
trying to transfer risks are you really

234
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,999
trying to protect yourself you can know
what you're trying to protect and you

235
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:45,590
don't want to go into this blindly
really understand what those exclusions

236
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,629
and conditions are I mean if you were to
get breached what are the things that

237
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:55,498
you may have to pay for what are the are
just a paper customer credit monitoring

238
00:18:55,499 --> 00:19:01,369
lawyer fees what is it you're trying to
get paid for also understand is there a

239
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:05,070
risk that based on the application
response is that you provide that you

240
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,820
there's a gap recently in the last two
weeks of his insurance company actually

241
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,408
sued their customer because in her
application he said yes we do this but

242
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,409
in the process of the insurance company
paying for the forensic

243
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,480
and post breach incident response they
realized they weren't doing any of this

244
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,370
breach of contract they sued the
customer and got them all of the money

245
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,780
back so you're very careful with those
exclusion clauses cuz they can really

246
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:37,010
screw you over and of course is a
decision that the risk management team

247
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,160
in your company's going to have the site
is the cost you know if the cost of the

248
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,920
premium worth it i mean is it really
going to protect you from being on the

249
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,840
front page of The Wall Street Journal is
it really going to help your business

250
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,919
from sinking its public that you were
breached so that's up to the risk

251
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,620
management team that the side that also
when you're working with an insurance

252
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,090
company it's always good to have someone
from added security team involved in

253
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,389
discussions because generally they will
be meeting with the risk management team

254
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:12,340
in the finance team not the security
team getting some attention company even

255
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,330
knows what they're talking about in
terms of security i mean i i when when

256
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,419
we helped our business team revamp their
application we just looked at the

257
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,350
options of what the hell were they think
this just makes us look like complete

258
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,389
idiots so we actually help them reform
elite application where we ask more

259
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,830
intelligent questions I would call to go
into a little bit about on how to

260
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:39,439
improve cyber insurance so the future
course objectives of the insurance

261
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,030
companies are more accurate pricing not
only so they can price for policies more

262
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,100
cheaply to sell more but also protect
themselves from from having to pay out

263
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,530
claims they want to really be able to
add value to their customers it

264
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,280
depending on their business model they
want more actual data is there really

265
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,260
isn't anything out there in uniform
matter governments and regulators also

266
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,930
have a stake Ennis they because
governments and regulators feel like

267
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,970
they want insurance companies to help
refine what the best practices and

268
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,840
security are and they figured hey from
historically insurance companies have

269
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,709
helped make cars safer have helped you
know people make healthier decisions

270
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,620
they know what's good and what's healthy
what's not healthy so their mindset is

271
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,800
maybe insurance companies can help
improve security through market forces

272
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,760
so some thoughts on that I have on how
to

273
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,290
to improve cyber insurance is to improve
how we look at our identify risks better

274
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:44,680
quantify we instead of questions like do
you have antivirus we should instead ask

275
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,870
questions like What is your incident
response process how long does it take

276
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,449
for you to identify something respond
and remediate

277
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,010
that's a lot more important whether you
have X Y and Z product in place it's

278
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,540
more important how you react to a
situation or a scenario that's more

279
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,310
important

280
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:08,050
better collection reach information
because there is no consistent way of

281
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,030
collecting this data right now it's
useful to understand what controls in an

282
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:17,320
environment or failing that allow
baghdad again in the record that based

283
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,120
on maybe you know who the bad guys were
what industry you're working in maybe

284
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,699
you meet with insurance company will see
patterns such as you know what I say we

285
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,350
see the cybercrime cybercrime ring in
russia specifically targeting say

286
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,770
retailers and they use these types of
attacks when that information that is

287
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,980
useful to help customers potentially
protect themselves and also protected

288
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,750
chance company so they don't have to pay
a claim and may be improving the

289
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,710
monitoring of risk to the invite
environment similar to how there's

290
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,610
telematics now it with some auto
insurance where you put some obd2 device

291
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,899
to monitor your driving behaviors

292
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,800
even some thoughts on partnering with
some tech companies or products where we

293
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,580
can help them keep an eye on things we
can kind of a raise our hands hey you

294
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,370
know we notice that this kind of weird
stuff is happening not so much as a

295
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,500
monitoring services that gets into a
whole grade legal space that we don't

296
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,550
want to get into but trying to figure
out that found a partner with Chuck up

297
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,930
tech companies and businesses to be able
to help better monitor the risks are

298
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,480
going on out there so those are kind of
some of my thoughts on on how to improve

299
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,450
cyber insurance but it in summary cyber
insurance is very immature but the

300
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,520
demand is continuing to grow as I said
that the potential market is lloyd says

301
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,190
85 billion dollars

302
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,159
only two billion dollars being paid in
premiums so there's a lot of opportunity

303
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,220
for companies to jump in and start
offering his services but the growth is

304
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,570
slow down because no one really knows
how to practice not yet do it right

305
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,139
insurance companies will need to build
better actuarial data whether its access

306
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:03,070
to information sharing through
government entities or industries some

307
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,320
industries are sharing information with
one another but very siloed is very

308
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,439
industry-specific there needs to be some
way of brain that data together or maybe

309
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,750
some company building their own
proprietary database that becomes a

310
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,360
defacto standard that everyone uses and
also finally the products at each

311
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,479
company will offer will vary greatly so
buyer beware

312
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,860
really know what you're getting
ourselves into and understand what these

313
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:33,250
exclusions are so that's kind of it so
that's my contact information I guess

314
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,250
there are some questions out there as
well

315
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:57,059
data-sharing for anyone who does
business with the government so yet that

316
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,678
can be a basis for a framework on how
the industry can adopt out maybe they're

317
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,830
not required to document account thought
that that is a framework however I think

318
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,090
the idea of information sharing is sexy
but a lot of companies are also

319
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,369
reluctant to share that information
because they don't want to provide too

320
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:20,779
much detail on you know how was I preach
what controls fail in my environment so

321
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,489
there's also reluctance and companies
doing that type of sharing from my

322
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,139
understanding the the organization
organization that do very good sharing

323
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:33,580
its very silent to a specific industry
but also the data that they're currently

324
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,119
sharing is not actionable they're gonna
provide very high-level information hey

325
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,340
look out for russian Prime rain with
this IP range that we have seen such a

326
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,649
good start but that's not that may not
be enough data to town of the Celtic

327
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:56,199
herd immunity yeah exactly it doesn't
tell you what failed at the cust at

328
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,759
someones environment to allow them in
and other questions

329
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:19,750
has had a hundred hundred years of
refining a figure what customers really

330
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,160
want where things are really care about
whether things we should protect

331
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:32,220
ourselves from while this is so new that
they're still offering and out every

332
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,080
company will try to have a competitive
edge by offering something a little bit

333
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,889
different but eventually it'll
normalizing to still down to the core

334
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,890
things that everyone cares about

335
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:07,330
they will trust from so if you already
got a pen test run them that's fine now

336
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,760
for some companies will any penthouse is
fine and they just review the results

337
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,700
make sure they're comfortable with it so
again it's very some cut the more mature

338
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,290
companies will have a list of approved
ones out they will accept a report from

339
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:41,040
think we offer anything here in the
states where i think is another question

340
00:27:41,040 --> 00:28:04,850
from yesterday i buy a policy tomorrow
if there's evidence that the breach

341
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,340
happens when a place that it doesn't
count just like if you tried to crash

342
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,879
your car and then buy insurance or late
will know why I crashed my car during

343
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:31,680
the policy and they figure that it
wasn't similar situation I believe so

344
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,900
yeah question

345
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:49,070
internet now I just like any other
questions

346
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:14,070
so that's the reason why those
questionnaires are so vague to allow

347
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:19,639
them to do that now I have heard
anecdotally you do not hear from me but

348
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,990
there are even instances where insurance
companies are paying even though they

349
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,940
don't have to the reason they're doing
that is to be almost a good gesture the

350
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,530
market to demonstrate hey this is a real
product you will actually get claims

351
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:38,370
paid if you have a breach so it's again
it's it really is a game in any new type

352
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,370
of market it's a game

353
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:31,580
the question answered yes we do
continuous monitoring of the network we

354
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,259
refresh this every so often and then
came that the reason why they got breach

355
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:39,360
was because they were not monitor
network traffic and something bad was

356
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,889
happy to know when to start spiraling
out of control and I think that was the

357
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:48,719
case so it was it was it was probably
misrepresentation but again you remember

358
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,549
that the people who are answering these
applications are not security people

359
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:56,320
their risk management finance folks so
that's why it's very important that if

360
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,809
your company is interested in engaging
in this type of policy and and

361
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:05,320
application they need to involve people
who actually understand the topic

362
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,200
because the the chief risk officer may
go to see some say hey yeah we kind of

363
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,700
do this and we do XYZ and technical
detail and was measuring guide may not

364
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,399
understand is that we do all that and
answer that way in the application

365
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:27,909
understand the environment than once
thought right now I think there is a new

366
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:32,090
cyber bill that is going through has to
do with supply chain understand supply

367
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:38,449
chain of a part of technology company
and see and if this gets passed any

368
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:44,070
company that does business with the
government has to be will provide a bill

369
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,539
of materials for all the software that
they bill you know what open source

370
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:55,280
software any open source components if
so what version numbers if this version

371
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,020
there are there any known
vulnerabilities at the time of when this

372
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,970
was being done other known
vulnerabilities so credibility and

373
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,340
transparency also helps understand that
risk right now comes on to that so this

374
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,120
cyber bill that they're pushing kind of
push through will require that for

375
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,408
companies that do business to government
but there's nothing to stop church

376
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:20,750
coming from adopting at same methodology
and understanding the bill of materials

377
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:27,010
that goes into their customer's
environment we are a long way from that

378
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,010
yes

379
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,270
questions

380
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,580
thank you very much and if anyone is
interested in the Scottish come see me I

381
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,580
can share some

382
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:13,100
there's a little bit of a break before
the next which starts read it too if

383
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,909
you're doing he spoke on the robot
battle you need to finish our robot by 2

384
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:25,850
p.m. over in the pool area if you have
not made a robot and you want to make a

385
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,449
last-minute robot like everybody else

386
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:33,210
trent from mag labs who's running the
contest as headed back from the $0.99

387
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,570
store with a whole bag of treats which
you can build a samurai robot we're so

388
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,060
if you're interested in going to the
pool area otherwise we're here for the

389
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,149
next
