1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
welcome to our next talk hopefully if
you're competing in the demo party

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:14,009
contests you submitted it otherwise you
have ninety seconds so by now I have

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,779
done the room so good luck to all of
them next up we have ghost doing yet

4
00:00:20,779 --> 00:01:03,510
another detail stock and on some of the
things I described in the previous text

5
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:12,360
self that's what it is about now before
I continue you have any problems in the

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,409
standing me just let me know and I'll
try to speak at a slower explain more

7
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:24,020
fortunate second degree of Jackson short
notice but so what

8
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,570
vendor

9
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:39,369
equipment in the past in that space for
Cisco as well as I kind of Brenda edge

10
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:45,100
infrastructure for Yahoo and get some
time before that in other words company

11
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:54,710
that does what services so acquainted
with the topic so let's see what are we

12
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,669
going to cover today so I'm going to go
over some of the general concepts of

13
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,549
what did offices and then I'll focus in
particular on what his being popular

14
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:12,120
over the last year now if we want to do
anything that would take a week

15
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,010
turning into one cover most of it so
I'll just focus on the future of

16
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,798
repeating that is the refering over the
last year and if you have any questions

17
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:27,190
regarding other types we can either
covered in the Q&A or if you have time

18
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,930
at the end of the session I have some
big cup sizes that can also use for that

19
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:38,180
so what is the date of this more
interactive I don't want everybody to

20
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:46,040
fall asleep on me right after lunch and
after talks so what is the US Germany ok

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,040
so what does that mean to you

22
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:19,510
you have a website based on a number of
connections without overwhelming the

23
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,340
pipe and this is very important to
notice because he's not only one type of

24
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,629
the US in general we didn't get a crease
focusing on exhausting a particularly

25
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,690
source in all the resources or change to
each other so in a chain or is the

26
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,650
weakest link was a week is a new week is
a chain which is a strong as its weakest

27
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,629
links with senior we did ask if you can
find a particular component that can be

28
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:52,358
exploited and overwhelmed and enter the
entire house of cards for was down so in

29
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:56,400
general this is a resource exaction
exhaustion and now I want you to

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,090
consider how is that different from
having your website featured on my watch

31
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:08,250
Mediasite incidentally drawing huge
amount of traffic exactly the antenna

32
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,449
technology point of view

33
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:14,799
no difference in some cases there may be
different depending on the approach that

34
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,719
used to create now service but in
particular you're just going to end up

35
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,710
not being able to provide service to
your users in this is what really is

36
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,770
important in this particular case now
from security point of view I did also

37
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:39,169
is a decreased availability of the three
teams in triangle there if your

38
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:43,840
operations guy this will be just an
outage was very important

39
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,508
couple things when you're trying to do
with the doors and prepare your

40
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,130
infrastructure for the doors you be
talking to see types and those people

41
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:59,110
don't understand same packets they don't
understand connections per second in

42
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,340
most cases what they understand his
money and the money that they're going

43
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,508
to lose so it's very important to be
able to frame what did offices for those

44
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,979
types so you know from security point of
you know availability an outage for the

45
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:18,460
operations people now the difference
between them and us that's kind of thing

46
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,630
that has been repeated over and over
again over the past it was implied that

47
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,270
if it is indeed also you know this is
the biggest the bigger thing than dost

48
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:34,530
thou wast your somebody came with it was
DDR those or something like this which

49
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,989
was reflected the ostrich name again
somebody trying to come up with more

50
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,479
terms but what does that mean to you it
means either more traffic or less

51
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:49,969
traffic in the past now they say not
quite that way and why let's look at the

52
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:55,750
next light on trying to explain that in
the past we had an attacker which was

53
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,710
controlling the CNC and issuing commands
to one army of boats or some basis

54
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,669
Jeremy called them then they would
deliver the attack traffic to the victim

55
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,440
over the past couple of years there has
been a proliferation of so-called

56
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,090
reflective attacks or reflected the tax
those attacks operate slightly

57
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,960
differently so you have a single attack
a diesel engine aiding get tacking

58
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,560
traffic but they are using a one juror
number of misconfigured systems that

59
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,729
they're in internal going to send
traffic to the victim directly so you

60
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,960
don't really need to have a CNC because
some of the ratios of amplification

61
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,520
amplification on the order of 50 so if
you have one gigabit connection to the

62
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,030
Internet

63
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,340
any consumer up that means that you can
produce 50 gigabytes of the traffic

64
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,969
towards your victim so does it really
matter refugees doors or windows or and

65
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:56,550
you call the second thing did also
really or is it you know just single

66
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,080
machine the disaffected sending traffic
to reflect the doesn't really matter the

67
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,229
defect is the amount of traffic you're
getting so looking at the end with

68
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:14,620
attack been doing over the past so 2010
London jeanne was a particular

69
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:22,000
government said that that was attacked
at the time than in 2011 traffic went

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,020
slightly higher and then went to three
hundred and then last year so sorry to

71
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,609
have a little before was 300 West Hills
400

72
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:41,589
does that really matter is dependent on
the Internet is increasing those numbers

73
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:49,800
don't really mean anything because you
know hundred gigs in 2010 was quite a

74
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,940
while now they having in mind that each
of the companies probably his squad

75
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,190
report their connectivity to the
Internet the transit providers has more

76
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,919
than ten twenty times will be had at the
time those numbers will continue growing

77
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:10,180
again does it really matter not quite
what really matters is the financial

78
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:16,089
damage to particular entity that they're
suffering through the now service now

79
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:22,620
who is suffering the damage curious if
you think about that so one of them is

80
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,310
obvious that would be the target site
let's say amazon.com goes down there's

81
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,310
the obvious who else is suffering

82
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,630
co-hosted systems ok so if you have a
system that is you know Caucasian or in

83
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:45,889
a datacenter or virtual hosting or
hosted services provider other instances

84
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:48,889
will suffer what else

85
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,060
customers trying to get the data but
technically they are derivative of the

86
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:03,529
side that is being a taxi yes the
margins ok providers the test two

87
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:12,760
tragedies bandwidth suffer what do they
make money out of it that's part of the

88
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,910
problem why why are some of the problems
not so here what for all those transit

89
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,680
providers this is just more traffic that
they're transporting the chair charging

90
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,250
nine-year 90% percent of the traffic the
more the more they charge I'm not saying

91
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,470
that they're intentionally sponsoring
did also I'm just saying is that they

92
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,970
have certain that he walked into or
looking at their economic model it is

93
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,510
not that expensive to have details for
as long as you can transported without

94
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,630
going down when you were on average when
you are on average provider in the USA

95
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,579
you have well over hundred G transit
well over that so you know most of the

96
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:51,239
diagnosis you can transport without a
problem so i think you know that's one

97
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,220
thing to kind of look at you see that
there is a very simple ways that you can

98
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:05,660
resolve some of the devices but you know
some of the world's providers are not

99
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,890
that willing to to to focus on that and
also you know from their point of view

100
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,449
there's also some legislation that
prevents them from inspecting the

101
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:20,620
traffic so it's it's a little bit more
complicated there so what are the

102
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,620
contributing factors this year

103
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,050
embedded devices are topping the chart
couple of years ago I mentioned those is

104
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,420
being on the rise

105
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,779
being a very interesting vectors to use
as reflectors for forgiveness reflected

106
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,449
in those attacks now they have become
too

107
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:48,439
issued a member of the attacks against
Xbox in Sony over the holidays now this

108
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:56,529
is a public information bankruptcy those
are all coming from devices that were

109
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:03,859
basically home gateways or more than
they were vendors that were quoted in

110
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:10,419
that article 602 more because to mention
other vendors screening up seriously but

111
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,569
I would encourage you to go and look at
those vendors are because then I

112
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:17,649
encourage you to look at some other
things lately my talk which will be

113
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:25,419
pointing to and then you can see some
questions that would arise from that so

114
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,449
as I said

115
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:37,410
embedded devices which are they were
selected for NTP in Jenison disappear

116
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,959
not only home devices then and passion
content management systems like dream

117
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,388
world worth press those are also a
contributing factor though they have

118
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,569
kind of fallen out of favor they don't
give you a water tank for the bug that

119
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:56,118
is a kind of more what do you need to do
actually have to expose you have to

120
00:11:56,119 --> 00:12:00,309
write scripts embed a PHP script or
prosecute or something else there with

121
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,299
the reflective she just send them
aquarian then they respond back with

122
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:10,209
amplification now going more details of
this thing work works another problem is

123
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:15,339
hosting providers that allow that the
law deflection so again going back to

124
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:16,259
the providers

125
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,799
skills in these providers transit
providers this is just more money

126
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,529
because they're transporting more
traffic for the ones that give you

127
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:30,779
hosting this is just more customers that
they're willing to pay $100 to $200

128
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:35,230
amount to have a machine that is
connected to the Internet over wi-fi

129
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,470
connection with no outbound filtering so
they can spoof anything they want

130
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,290
and otherwise imagine there's more
bandwidth available now who is the

131
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,899
adversary that kind of obvious the only
thing this kind of different is that

132
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,670
there is more and more games that
involved in that appears to be very

133
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:06,199
popular for people to other people that
may be performing better than them in a

134
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:12,099
particular game I personally don't quite
get that cause you know they're not

135
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:19,079
outside of it there's also a large
number of professional operators those

136
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,269
are the so-called birthers which provide
that service look a little bit more into

137
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:31,560
what they do there's also a number of
groups that one way or another are

138
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,849
backed by a particular states you can
think of some of the attacks that we

139
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:42,170
experienced that two years ago mostly
get the financial system and then she

140
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,360
look it may be a correlation with
particular country being kicked out of

141
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,010
Swift gonna give you a little bit more
answers to some nice pretty much

142
00:13:53,010 --> 00:14:01,649
everyone and their skill level so the
skill level has always been kind of law

143
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:08,639
over the past year there have been a
couple samples that must die and some of

144
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,970
the other side the divorcing looked at
which are becoming more and more complex

145
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,519
including you know called in languages
that they're not that popular amongst

146
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:30,410
the script script kiddies also advanced
CNC to some of those so it looks like

147
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,569
people are taking it seriously at least
on the offensive side so that's one of

148
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:41,329
the things that can change over the last
year year and a half and is always there

149
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:46,620
has been a fairly strong segmentation of
the market between the two states and

150
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,029
the people that actually using those
tools and the two Smith just make money

151
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:56,100
out of selling those kids they can vary
between your fifty sixty dollars to the

152
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,430
$400

153
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:05,300
and that somebody else goes and uses
them now motivation financial can also

154
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,550
be used to suppress each so in
particular there have been a number of

155
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:17,930
documented cases where the attacks have
been attributed to China and they have

156
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:26,640
been against Tibetan activists or other
groups trying to send a message out in

157
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,990
some cases it actually being used to
divert attention and this is no longer

158
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,490
the case but still some companies
suffered that in the past many

159
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,170
completion of their web presence on the
same internet connection is the company

160
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,260
or their corporate offices and they
would normally hosts a web service

161
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:50,990
inside the corporation this is not the
case for most companies nowadays but the

162
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,029
ones that you do when they have one
static situation event if you discovered

163
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,360
by the doors they cannot see the traffic
is really going out but again I'm kind

164
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,370
of calling this out because it was used
in the past it can be used nowadays but

165
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,310
I'm going down now what's new

166
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:18,979
mentioned voters stressors in the
embedded devices any questions so far so

167
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:26,170
fortunately I'm not very good in our
point so have to play those for you but

168
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,680
i think is worth a thousand words so
I'll try with this one

169
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:46,490
we are here to provide you the hackers I
drop it

170
00:16:46,490 --> 00:17:03,320
professional dear sir we get your
discount only be any more cheesy also

171
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,330
the person in particular doesn't
probably even have an idea what DDoS is

172
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:17,119
but you know people would not pass this
way but anyway you can see kind of what

173
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:32,330
this is about whether a strong first
then something that looks like a few end

174
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:40,909
so you get the point you get the point
of those ads are targeting you know

175
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,090
actually this guy stuff is with
something that they find much more hip

176
00:17:44,090 --> 00:18:00,399
the right place

177
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:14,320
so he starts with the more commercial
stuff and appears like somebody that has

178
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:23,450
a clue and then we under put the cheesy
marketing which for the clientele that

179
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,030
she seems to be attracting so anyway

180
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:36,480
laughing at that those services between
five to 10 gigs 220 250 gigs per second

181
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:46,290
it's not going to be defending against
now what's interesting is the normal

182
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:54,129
attacks within 357 usually they don't
get to 10 minutes can somebody just why

183
00:18:54,130 --> 00:19:08,130
so usually five minutes and they average
the results so if you want to be under

184
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:14,610
the Raider and not be shut down easily
in there has to reboot your server

185
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,020
somewhere else you have to stay below
that so that it doesn't look very very

186
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,850
big on the graph of your provider now
the other reason is that those mostly

187
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,209
cater to people that play games if I
want to take somebody off 11 playing

188
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:36,440
World of Warcraft or what was the other
one I don't need more than five minutes

189
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:45,470
of the US I want the game that's it so I
think you know that those of the tourism

190
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,910
but the thing is that they don't usually
less than five minutes should not be

191
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,360
underestimated because those are you
know kids that do that with those kids

192
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,360
usually run between

193
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:29,470
completely different story as I
mentioned their particular two or three

194
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:42,559
vendors Asia their specific default
password admin admin or admin password

195
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,870
or something like this those who those
lists can be found on the internet

196
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:52,408
some of them have open gayness
Denisovans that cannot even be disabled

197
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:59,470
and those on the internet interface not
on the home phone on the opposite side

198
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,929
and there was also another double-digit
game and you know that came out in the

199
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:11,850
net net USB module which allows you to
remotely general to the box in most of

200
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:18,379
those cases the mode of operation is
fairly simple they look into the device

201
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,980
install script in this script listens to
commands or post the CNC sometimes you

202
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,230
need to hit the device in execute the
script with certain parameters or in the

203
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,809
other cases clip would both the census
survey execute commands in the second

204
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:39,330
case in particular when their Xbox
attacks the description also deleted

205
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,779
after they were executed so it's very
difficult to the forensics and those

206
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:49,940
kaczynski did not exist on the phone
system anymore and pretty simple you

207
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,289
know doesn't seem like somebody put a
lot of effort into those but it's a

208
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:58,720
fairly powerful weapon so come to scan
speculating if I was to be a

209
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,059
state-backed manufacturer and if I
wanted to create a bunch of cheap you

210
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,049
know weaponry and distributed around the
world I would I do that I'm not saying

211
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:16,830
they're doing that I'm just saying if I
was to be you know what I would do so no

212
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,320
other question

213
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,909
and that's one thing how the money will
benefit from all those bills in exposing

214
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:30,240
kind of coming to those devices now
looking at the track surface or switch

215
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,320
to more technical now I'm sure your
general BS different network layers

216
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:45,720
attacks can be much happened in any of
those layers now 10 over time is that

217
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:56,560
the lower layer get a keys using the
more compute-intensive this so if we

218
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,720
have a sense that it would result in a
waterfall impact is going to from one

219
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,080
machine to another station and then in
order to mitigate this you have to

220
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,500
generate some cookies and so on song
which is deeply computing and network

221
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,470
intensive now the higher-level the
attacks are the less network bandwidth

222
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,220
you see so for example she have an XML
expansion attack you send these small

223
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,090
XML sleep which is the silver than the
Syrian the president's incidentally

224
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:31,959
blows with memory footprint so that's
kind of a general rule it's not always

225
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:39,150
the case but you know most cases it is
true also warrants for example so what

226
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:44,730
is you can send one packet every you
know fifty seconds is to keep him

227
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:50,840
occupied for a very very long time so
very low network resource utilization

228
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,879
you can't see that on the natural gas
but then the services rendered

229
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,380
inoperable in this case also the city on
the service will be law they were just

230
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:07,820
out of a descriptive or circuits ok so
reflection amplification there are two

231
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,240
different concept one of them is
reflection the other one is

232
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,890
simplification reflected types of the
popular one entity there's some SNMP

233
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:26,180
present for some reason didn't speak
much each other again maybe because

234
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,549
unisons it appears so sweet that there's
no point in doing it

235
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:34,369
you can read more on the implication
factors do yourself

236
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:38,519
publication that is quoted there it's at
the bottom of the screen right now is

237
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,950
where the link is so different

238
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:53,419
2254 I think actually can be covered in
that enabled I haven't played with

239
00:24:53,419 --> 00:25:02,379
myself but it can be hired to radically
NDP Asian

240
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,940
think about 1 gigabit if you can deliver
this computer to the target were looking

241
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,609
at 500 YouTube it's something to think
about

242
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:20,689
ok so what is reflected back reflection
and thank heaven and willing

243
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:25,570
intermediary in some way involved in it
and they will deliver the traffic for

244
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,970
the attacker so the attack will send the
packet usually happens over UDP

245
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,389
some cases where you can bring back
which is over to secure a little more

246
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:42,488
complicated does it's not worth putting
more effort when you can do it in a way

247
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:46,720
as simple as doing I'm sure you right
now so over UDP is your source IP

248
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,159
address with one of the victim send it
to machine it is pounds back and goes to

249
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,609
the victim to this is the reflection
part now let's look at how dennis is

250
00:25:56,609 --> 00:26:03,859
Russian works we had the so-called
authorities and Dennis and the problem

251
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:10,399
in particular open because its servers
so if we want to insult particularly

252
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:16,359
heinous name of the user send enquiry to
the result is over then retrieve Christi

253
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,330
police over goes on the cloud of the
other ones here is also called the

254
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:28,989
Internet five years ago and then we have
the route authority then we have the

255
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:37,139
dot-com authorities have the a10
authorities said so the question of

256
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:42,139
those once it has the answer is no
answer is going to response

257
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,370
the customer to the to the user if it
says no answer to just send an executive

258
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,040
if it is an answer is going to cash the
answer

259
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:59,930
instantly answered back to the user so
generous package level so the same thing

260
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:06,770
but now looking at how the package will
look serious cashed it immediately

261
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:14,360
respond so now it is not cached the
recursive resource and 12 the route 122

262
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,500
the Concord area to the eighth and
dinner service and then the result to go

263
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:26,840
back and actually infected cents to 44
redundancy but just what happens now if

264
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:33,379
I wanted to use the server for
reflection which mode of operation with

265
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:43,840
a choose to use if I wanted to spoof by
my question 23 treaty when I get a

266
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,840
higher rate response rate

267
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:57,850
it's all happening over you do people
from the looking at those two cases yes

268
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,370
exactly because it already has the
answer I sent him a question comes back

269
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:25,639
with an answer so reflection looks like
I'm sending Acquity then this answer my

270
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:40,650
question now I get answers no let's put
that on the table for second and look at

271
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:50,640
this query asking for any record for I C
dot org TTT well yes something like this

272
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,620
it intentionally is overflowing the skin
actually continues like 78 more screens

273
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:04,479
so if I was to ask this question I would
get big answer going to my victim and

274
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,680
forty just so is also amplifications I
have reflection and precipitation in

275
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,180
other words implication parties I sent a
small piece of information to somebody

276
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,030
and then I get much more in this is
where those implication that issues are

277
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,570
important in the table that I show you
from us-cert you know you can have

278
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:30,790
amplification up to 500 times which
protocols are susceptible to that Dennis

279
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:38,600
and I P P as an employee in other words
list now going back to the dynasties so

280
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:45,090
if I was to be a victim of a Dennis
attack what would I do not have a dinner

281
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,149
service somebody's

282
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:55,010
my Dennis what can I do I can first
validated the parties I can also

283
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:01,220
whitelist particular valid machines that
are going to be answering but that's a

284
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,909
little bit more complicated because

285
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:08,570
interest rates are not know what my
users will be asking against possible to

286
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:14,840
certain extent I can also do some kind
of validation and only validation passes

287
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:21,090
then I add them on to the white list and
then I service those queries we can do

288
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:27,519
you can issue challenges which is part
of the validation process and we can

289
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,859
also use some high performance equipment
that is going to do the job instead of

290
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:39,658
the DNS server and I was in here I can
also have a predefined list of known

291
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:45,179
Open DNS resolvers that are used for
reflection of the team be used for

292
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,519
reflection in the case of an attack I
can just start dropping all traffic from

293
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,259
those now here I am working with the
assumption that I have fairly large

294
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:59,269
amount of bandwidth going to my DNS
service because if i dont my bandwidth

295
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:03,479
will be over water to remember about the
bottleneck if you know if my bottom

296
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:07,099
exceeds the DNS server I can use all
those things to mitigate if my

297
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:10,789
bottleneck is the bandwidth going to
this DNS server and preschool that point

298
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:15,009
so I just have to wait for somebody
upstream like my providers to do the

299
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:21,679
mitigation for me now speaking of
challenges this topic and dennis is one

300
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,450
of those somewhat interesting because
she lets go over this and then we will

301
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,309
look at the conclusion so the DNS change
it looks like this

302
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:38,269
asks a question and we suspect that this
may not be a legitimate question then

303
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:42,119
we're going to respond with a CNAME
instead of providing the answer in the

304
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:49,658
same name has something which actually
is and then only if this machine on the

305
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:54,460
other end responds with a question
trying to resolve what its name is only

306
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,570
then I know that they're legit customer
or legit user so only then are providing

307
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,840
answers to this and potentially put them
on a waitlist now let's compare dismal

308
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,399
of operation to me immediately answering
the query even if this is a fake DNS

309
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,399
server what did just happen here

310
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:13,949
well unfortunately

311
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,620
me I have two times the amount of
traffic jams the packet rate

312
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,409
top of that I have to calculate some
precious and other stuff which is

313
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:28,809
traditional computer so unlike all the
other day doorsteps Dennis East has its

314
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:34,029
specifics and in particular it's much
more important much more expensive to

315
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:40,760
mitigate then to outperform the attacker
or to service the quickest so keep that

316
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:48,730
in mind dennis actually seems to be the
key issue in most cases so that was the

317
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:55,080
point about Dennis now another way to
mitigate infrastructure in your can look

318
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:01,820
at the service provider level we still
use any cast so any cast work you can

319
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:09,510
have you know unicast you have single IP
address or in the base case you can have

320
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,470
a load balancing and multiple service
but all those have to be in the exact

321
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,000
same physical locations with any case
this is not the case

322
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,950
what you have there is you can have
multiple occasions actually I have to

323
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,269
catch up with the sites we have one
location and all of the customers or

324
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:32,159
attackers will be attacking the occasion
with any cast you can have multiple

325
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,049
physical locations in each of them is
going to advertise this particular IP

326
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:41,720
space what will happen in this case is
that different attacks will be drawn to

327
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:50,750
the corset or routed to the courses
physical location is any sense this is

328
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,299
particularly to the Windy City stateless
even if routes are moving around there

329
00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:00,399
will be no outages some companies do
that with this appears well I personally

330
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,639
don't see a problem some of the kind of
all the Phils

331
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:10,029
disappear over any cast is a problem but
I don't think that this is an issue so

332
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:17,310
that's a way to to scare traffic now if
you were to be running a reflector issue

333
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:22,339
need for some reason to run a Open DNS
resolver it may be useful to rate

334
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:25,699
limited responses that you provide to
different customers would find this is

335
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,109
how the

336
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:30,418
generational look like now why would
somebody want to run a opened illnesses

337
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:42,089
over someone else okay so they may have
mobile workforce and for some reason

338
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:48,058
they move may want to give them static
DNS service it's possible or you can be

339
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:54,119
potentially Google DNS or openness which
are basing their more though this kind

340
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,819
of operation of course you could be you
know state-backed hardware manufacturer

341
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:07,589
ok and now from security point of view
you do not want to raise the issue

342
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:12,890
actually do not want to provide dinner
service to the internet you can just

343
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:19,680
create an access list in mind which will
look like this and this will limit IP

344
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:29,249
addresses disband civil response to
stuff their ok NTP my favorite

345
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:38,880
NDP is one of those protocols that can
definitely see was designed long long

346
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,089
time ago people were really good at
heart when they designed it it has the

347
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:53,869
concept of a statin away this is where
the heart of the number of the stratum

348
00:35:53,869 --> 00:36:02,920
is the further away this is from real
precise time and it allows you to get

349
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,680
the time from a centralized servers

350
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:11,669
didn't say but I think it's kind of
obvious Network Time Protocol so how

351
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:16,039
does that work we have a let's say
stratton wants a result on the internet

352
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,559
then head of corporate NTP server which
came created those in the end the users

353
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:26,480
who go included the core enterprise
servers in the get their time I think

354
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:34,920
Apple had seven minutes of but you know
the actual will be those boxes you

355
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,780
quitting the server which is quitting
the

356
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:47,370
other service so in one of the other
implementations I guess it was useful to

357
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,710
allow a systems administrator to
remotely quoted in tibet silver in see

358
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:59,810
what clients have ever asked to this
entry server for the time maybe hit some

359
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:05,509
application the past but right now it
doesn't have legitimate one in the

360
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,650
application uses so if you have the
system administrator

361
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,660
they made the question did they get a
copy of those two IP addresses the

362
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:22,839
server now what happened if it was a
spoof

363
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:31,170
from us both IP address well the answer
will go to the victim ok now here we

364
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,290
have only two IP addresses that you've
ever created the NTP server right so you

365
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,170
know the implication is not that big

366
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:44,870
now in the current implementation the
kids can be up to 600 entries received

367
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:52,330
some entries multiplied by four by 384
that will be the reflection that comes

368
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,120
back Jeremy that was the question

369
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:04,180
oh ok so think about their

370
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:17,290
so anyway and also you can limit access
least I don't want to come with all the

371
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:21,070
different configurations created like
blow through like four slides you can go

372
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:30,140
to website templates for juniper Cisco
and i cnt people whatever was the

373
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:40,190
opposite effect which is maintained by
the Open ATP project at the very bottom

374
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:54,220
ok go back to Janice again there's
nothing that's what kind of started

375
00:38:54,220 --> 00:39:00,169
surfacing again over the last 36 months
since the beginning of the year so let's

376
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:07,180
look at how DNA solution works again we
had the user asking the question the

377
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,060
reclusive is over goes on the internet
and asks question different story and

378
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,540
then comes back with the answer now
remember that the reclusive is over also

379
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,200
cases the queries that means that if we
have a network of hundred machines

380
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,370
working to one DNS resolver once this is
over decides to go once one of those

381
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,540
plans decides to go to google.com this
essay will be kissed let's say five

382
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,350
minutes and everybody else on the net
worth it wants to go to google.com is

383
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,069
going to use dancer from there is over
from the cache of the records is over so

384
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:45,030
looking at Dennis the book of the
queries are being asset in the very

385
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:50,950
bottom and by the recursive resolvers in
the answer out of their cassius so this

386
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,850
is how it's possible for a fairly small
numbers and number of service to be

387
00:39:54,850 --> 00:40:00,520
servicing the dot-com domains because
the dot-com answers will be cashed in

388
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:08,360
the lower layer or they'll be using
those cases now what if I decide to do

389
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,930
the following I asked for a random to me
it doesn't exist

390
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:28,349
then then I asked for another random
domain and so right now every single

391
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:33,960
question that I sent to the reclusive is
also related to do talkative now what if

392
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:43,619
I decide to use another because you
think is going to happen with utility

393
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:51,279
work is going to get lot more traffic
that it is designed to handle so that's

394
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:55,619
one of the attacks this has been
servicing later when people trying to

395
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:01,109
take down the authority service versus
taken down some companies Genesee River

396
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:08,200
those that can also be forwarded against
the company services for example you can

397
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,828
have random sting dog google.com randoms
to google.com and so on so this is going

398
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:23,269
to terminate attacking the Google's DNS
servers and so on so in all of those

399
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:27,569
attacks basically you can kind of look
at the medication so if you have to

400
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:31,880
defend yourself you can do any cast you
can deploy very expensive litigation

401
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:38,319
equipment in your picture now if you
have to defend other people you sure the

402
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,390
reflected in your offending other people
you can apply rate limiting

403
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:50,259
38 which is a policy that defines how to
configure outbound filtering so the

404
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:57,299
journal reflected in the two cannot
sponsor traffic and properly or dennis

405
00:41:57,299 --> 00:42:08,180
is in pieces and S&P service so between
those two the ones that they're required

406
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,930
to defend a company are fairly expensive
and on the other hand East you have to

407
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:19,078
protect the internet from yourself those
are first very cheap implement and

408
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,349
second

409
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:25,190
they're just a matter of best practices
if you do your job right you are not

410
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,049
going to be a reflector to the point I'm
trying to make it is that it's very

411
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:32,710
important for companies to look at their
own resources not only think what

412
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,749
they're going to do if they get attacked
but also make sure that they themselves

413
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:50,930
are not reflective sincere not being
used in attacks it I think questions

414
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:25,920
everything very very well in the
beginning of 2013

415
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:34,750
now why is that interesting well I see
is one of the companies that is running

416
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,579
one of the root DNS service so that was
one of the reasons they were also other

417
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:43,220
political reasons because I C was also
involved in some other initiatives

418
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,348
people against did not like they did not
like the people you know I see there

419
00:43:47,349 --> 00:44:04,490
were speculations there so so when you
ask any questions any indigenous you can

420
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,450
ask for a record or PTR record in one
case you get name to IP address

421
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:15,109
translation your case I P to name and
there's a bunch of other records and

422
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:20,319
when you request when you when you see
any quick you get all records for that

423
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:26,009
particular resource there's it's
questionable if there's any value to any

424
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:32,220
queries in many areas over snow this
configuration do not do not provide that

425
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,549
is the functionality but at the time
this was pretty much standard and also

426
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:43,329
note the fact that they were using I C
dot org isn't doesn't mean the jet

427
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:44,880
attack was directed at them

428
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,430
it meant that somebody was naming I C
dot org somebody was trying to send a

429
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,770
message Gazeta was actually against
somebody else they were just using GRC

430
00:44:52,770 --> 00:45:01,530
zone now these criminals what they would
do is they would create a specially

431
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:06,990
customized on with very large records so
when they send them any query they're

432
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:11,759
going to get the implication which I see
they were not getting that much

433
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,250
implication is if they have is they will
be getting if they created customs on

434
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:22,800
but it was a tribal war so somebody was
sending the message there cos I see did

435
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:36,339
something before ya questions does
services ok so the question is how

436
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:44,460
effective are some of the doors
screaming services so that's one of the

437
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,880
things I didn't cover today but there
are a couple ways you can do it did ask

438
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,190
me to get you one of the music in
expensive equipment embedded and defend

439
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,740
defend yourself the other one is you can
pay to somebody else to give your

440
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:00,029
traffic rerouted to them cleaned up and
then they send the clean truck back home

441
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:05,329
so those are fairly effective just
because those people do the daily and

442
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,849
they know what they're doing

443
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:12,280
however they're sitting down sides first
of them is cost it's not cheap in some

444
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:19,280
of those cases you know it can really go
fairly high and then you have to draw

445
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,560
your line is she say okay for an hour of
outage on my website I am losing let's

446
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:34,410
say twenty thousand dollars because of
lost economic and I'm paying $30,000 for

447
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,990
you know this mediation you made clear
that it's much cheaper to actually be

448
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:46,290
offline then pay for mediation some
companies pending so being down their

449
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,390
website being down is not good so how
you can forget it is very difficult it's

450
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,779
kind of difficult depends on the company
I have not been able to find a specific

451
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,349
number from any of the companies I have
worked with them from point of view of

452
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:04,890
reputation how much does an hour about
its cost you nobody has been able to

453
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:11,740
provide that answer so those those
services are effective but they did

454
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:16,240
costly some of them actually make you
pay based on clean traffic some of them

455
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,950
make you pay on the attack traffic and
again this depends how much traffic you

456
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:26,598
get normally now in some cases like
gaming providers that social not an

457
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:32,470
option because going to an intermediary
increase the latency for delivering this

458
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,939
content in this just doesn't work for
them so they have to do the mitigation

459
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:42,410
themselves if you do some online voice
service did East waste on broadcast but

460
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:47,069
its way or is interactive you have to do
the same thing again

461
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,690
other questions

462
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:09,630
because reflected in those are there any
providers that handled that well okay so

463
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:15,600
the receiving end doesn't matter if it's
affected areas direct you know cases

464
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,580
it's a matter of how much bandwidth you
have any of the provider can can

465
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:28,540
mitigate that so for example you know
does this job you know as your job now

466
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:34,590
this question reminding me another
question you know kind of brushed on but

467
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:41,330
their providers like secretary and stir
them don't provide you unfettered access

468
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:46,290
so if you want to speak against before
you want so there are certain providers

469
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:51,060
the favor of her favorites of the people
to do this type of abuse

470
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,060
other questions

471
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:15,229
yes that's actually a topical
intentionally or just covered in a few

472
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:20,089
words and then we can talk more of what
happened about four to six weeks ago

473
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:28,269
china or it is attributed to China and
intention was attributed to China

474
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:31,640
because it was obvious that the traffic
is coming from the great China firewall

475
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,729
so that was kind of difficult to not do
it properly

476
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:39,549
however the intention was also treated
to China was that they were injecting

477
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:47,749
pieces of called this is a javascript it
was exactly three packets are sent to

478
00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:50,779
customers that were visiting China

479
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:57,469
inject the JavaScript was injected and
then it would send a lot of traffic

480
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:02,640
towards get her so by injecting
JavaScript in the traffic they were

481
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:09,598
turning all those browsers into drawings
that were attacking get her so I think

482
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,369
this is the first time we're seeing some
active really active initially

483
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:22,449
attributable attack from their other
questions

484
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,440
okay thanks everyone
