1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,170
everybody you're liars I'm a member of
that's the open organization of luck

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:18,509
pickers and organizational operators
means we pick locks as a sport without

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:26,689
force without physical dynamics and
normally without peace that's fine as a

4
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:30,060
sports lock picker we have to live by

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,640
couple of very simple rules rule number
one do not pick locks that you do not

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,440
own or have explicit permission from the
actual owner and that you are allowed to

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,870
speak it and do not and if we can help
in any way shape or form we do not take

8
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,780
lockstep we will I was at some point you
will fail and a piece of metal door lock

9
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,570
will fail or your picture will break in
and you have a piece of metal in your

10
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,110
locker so then you can open or close
your front door is around so if we can

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,699
help it

12
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:10,689
we refrained from picking important loss
I'm also a member of 42 which is bigger

13
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:18,139
space in Arnhem the Netherlands that's
actually a space between europe once and

14
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,640
they simply describe this text raises
the most powerful space existence of

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,500
course I can only agree with it

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,070
clipper hope the audio picks it up

17
00:02:12,860 --> 00:03:01,610
who thinks this is a good idea correct
but I think it's a neat idea it's a good

18
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:08,770
idea well one point this is a commercial
by a Belgian insurance company so issue

19
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,770
house guests included afterwards at
least you know who's going to pay for it

20
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,239
and I only get this clip because I don't
know where you guys left but in my

21
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,060
neighborhood is way easier to find a
locksmith dan air 3d printing facility

22
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:30,590
but the concept is counter-coup you soon
as they did they put a key on it turning

23
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,200
pedestal and it basically made a 3d scan
of it for you guys who do the previous

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,890
talk it's it's not rocket science
anymore but they put it on attorney

25
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,339
thing to 3d data from a free site

26
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,920
well like I said this was from Belgium
insurance company in Belgium is in

27
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,630
Europe which is not America why do a
precise that in America if you're

28
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:04,120
looking at normal household locks
commercial big big numbers but on the

29
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,209
average front door you basically get a
shake or a quick set as a deficit so

30
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:17,440
basically you can choose between two
brands of loss so then you don't have to

31
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,230
three

32
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,060
escape your hope you only need to be
eating goat and of course you have to

33
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,350
figure out which of the two blocks that
is actually on the door and that will

34
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:34,030
get you could hit radio show in America
are you can do stuff like this there are

35
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:41,080
companies this is what they ask you to
do is take a picture one picture with

36
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,380
just my phone off your key forward Brett
Favre click did it make sure we will

37
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:58,510
mail you your key I probably would not
use my home address for that so far for

38
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:05,530
you get a duplication you get to do from
your locker for the actually wrote to

39
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,109
meet self-assured

40
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,130
they don't just copied 101 but they scan
your picture and figure out what the

41
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:21,230
actual code was was so if you have a
team that has some wear and tear so the

42
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,410
death would be awarded but it turned out
to be one and a half billion time then

43
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:33,710
the copy day said you will be
effectually card number so if you have

44
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,630
an old there isn't a book every chance
that the company you getting your mail

45
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:46,340
you physically will work better than
your original just kind of cool I think

46
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,619
it's kind of cool so that someone
picture alone are more companies

47
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,740
incorporated this same business case
with individuals

48
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:07,390
they work in Manhattan and what they do
they're basically a physical so they

49
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:13,640
show up at your house take away the
paper mail it take to the office

50
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,830
stationery and they mail it to you by
email so you can read your email

51
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,880
properly safeguard your spam mail but
I'm not sure about that and they said

52
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,790
well you can sign up to our 22222 are
serviced by sending us a picture of your

53
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,460
piece it depends on where your mail is
it is it in a mailbox that we need a

54
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,140
picture that mailbox key is your mailbox
in your character that we need your

55
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:50,310
guarantees and so they have all sides of
several scenarios so they need to do to

56
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,080
your gate or door but they stopped at
your front door and do not want to enter

57
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,020
your house in america guess they're
afraid of getting sued or dogs or

58
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,099
shuttle Endeavour so but so did your
privacy issue that that they don't want

59
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,100
to get into it just wanna have your mail
to serve us and like I said they only

60
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:19,180
need a picture of your peace or your key
or whatever how much the latest with one

61
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,070
pictured it can make a key is you know
it's definitely not this is a picture

62
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:30,310
from the year 2008 Universal California

63
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:37,620
a project called sneaky is a camera with
a kickass lands which you can do it

64
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,300
lands like that you can take pictures
from far away as a terrorist's the

65
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:49,400
terrorists as a table to table is a book
and the book there are some peace if we

66
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:56,739
look at this picture is kind of taken
straight on you can see the bidding of

67
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:06,450
the key candy-coated BC if we take a cut
out of that picture and if you look at

68
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:13,840
the stuff you know me with your fingers
on you see that that has a peculiar

69
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:22,070
shape with the triangles got out of it
and those locks and knowing it's a

70
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,050
Kwikset and so we can know we can figure
out what two dimensions of that hatch

71
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:33,000
should be so we can do is keep on
altering that picture dropping its shape

72
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,360
and moving at about until that had in
the picture is difficult to correct

73
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,539
dimensions if we figure that one out
that we know that the rest of the key

74
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,060
also has the correct dimensions and we
can just what those that song and then

75
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,910
we can run it on a copy machine and just
make a working key I just learned this

76
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,449
year I'm not from America on from the
Netherlands and we do things different

77
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,130
in Europe I learned but you probably
already know that that if you gettin you

78
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:14,780
home depot or whatever so many different
numbers and one lucky thats do direct

79
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,510
code

80
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,870
I don't think that's a good idea what I
mean with direct cody's if you want

81
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,430
their number into a key copying machine
or a key cutting machine it will reduce

82
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:35,969
that key so not showing your keys is
even more important and I'm telling here

83
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,740
is the code of your keys on the key
already years but it's kind of obligated

84
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,290
but now it's just printed on it that's
that's no security that's I don't think

85
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:57,280
that is okay so officially decoding aqui
coat from just a picture this is a

86
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,189
snapshot from a conference in the
Midlands and what you see is a 3d print

87
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:13,710
of Turkey dad used to be there all
German police office costs are normally

88
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:19,830
be like if you think for it for just a
second you might go like that's stupid

89
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,710
but actually it's not cuz if you get
arrested by Cup number 12 to put you in

90
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,500
this vehicle in east central station
daily hands you over to another officer

91
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,880
it's kind of neat that he's able to open
the locks as a device that's gonna hurt

92
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,189
in the end so it's quite normal for a
country to have told me they like maybe

93
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:48,810
44 per department it's different but
that happens this is so that's the

94
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,589
German he and a friend of Michaels rate
is a member of SSDs which is basically

95
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:59,720
to Germany he just laws he said he has a
good silly of a man of course he had

96
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,540
this key while also the middle he was
walking at the crown ground and he saw

97
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,870
police officers Dutch police officers
patrolling the grounds to see if we do

98
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,600
stuff and he showed me her house and he
was like that's his lips as he instantly

99
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:27,130
recognized brand and make of that it was
like that's the same brand and make the

100
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,930
gym across so he went off to disbelieve
even went on to the police officers like

101
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:41,410
this can I tried my keys in your hand
and foot lease officer said and turned

102
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,410
his victory

103
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:53,089
ok this is not the most clearest picture
and you'll probably get it probably will

104
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,460
not be that easy actually deep throat
the key because the codification this

105
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,780
picture but I don't know if it's deadly
but you can see it's a high low high in

106
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:14,339
a bit of work that's what if I compare
that with the original it's a safe yes

107
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,960
this is the correct he even former
sherry crappy picture you might not get

108
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,190
all the info you need but you still
leaking information even from this

109
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:34,500
crappy picture I can kind of assess that
this is too cranky and a bit later yes

110
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,270
another police officer tried that and
sure enough he suggested like for all

111
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,630
the German but also for the Dutch
leaders so yep so if you ever coming to

112
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:57,439
a page in the Netherlands here you can
download these so it's fun so only one

113
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,889
picture was enough to basically

114
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:08,170
okay what i'm looking at here is a
typical clean desk environment worker

115
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:16,790
workspace but I also see a key so what
we did for references we put a a corner

116
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:23,949
next to the key so if we print that
picture we know how big the key is cost

117
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:30,118
me know how big the corner and of course
this is flat on that it wouldn't be

118
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:36,209
route I also know how to crop due to
talk at picture to actually get a rod

119
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:42,349
porn and directs us if if that's on
correctly this one is also the correct

120
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,600
size and if we know it's a crappy log
and this is a cabinet lock so we kind of

121
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:56,600
if we take a piece of paper and put a
sheet of metal behind its and all go all

122
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,720
kindergarten on it and stay within the
boundaries of lines and cut it out with

123
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:10,249
some law that will open your locker so
what we have here is a piece of material

124
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:20,360
that's a fairly good shape what the key
should be and sure enough so crappy

125
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,879
locks to cripple your it gets easier
this is well like I said in the

126
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:34,389
beginning that in America are you a
quick sets and other stuff so other

127
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:40,919
stuff is a lot of other stuff is quite
good I mean in america you have family

128
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:49,569
gridlock's also have a very crappy laws
between as in the rest of the world

129
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:53,689
well at least in Europe that's what I
know if you can have it looks great

130
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:58,169
locks but you have a multitude of
choices between that so you can get in

131
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:03,730
OK long that's hard in america to get a
good look at is nothing in between

132
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,209
well guess what kind of TV and

133
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:17,649
good looks so normal all Loch Leven
above his chances that's actually

134
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,449
cracked and so I'm not saying this might
work but if you go to the lockpick

135
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,240
village you can try it out for yourself

136
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,589
those are normal and also blocks you can
just open it

137
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:37,189
ok that's without any prior knowledge of
course some larger more important and

138
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:45,309
needs to be kept a secret a bit more he
is basically the password to your front

139
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:45,959
door

140
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,959
it's just a coach you punching

141
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:56,879
roundabout way but it's a coke you give
to your door and then it opens in a

142
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:03,199
couple of years ago a story arose that
you were able to buy its Nikki two-day

143
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:13,540
New York subway system online 4-8 Vicky
I mean that's the most so you have a

144
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:20,160
system of peace and a key to open a door
but imagine he will open the doors

145
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:30,399
$27 get so initially people going to
subway system free writing services

146
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,079
yes you can do that can get everybody
industry actually you can make sure that

147
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,508
nobody's getting for free cuz you have
access to technical cabinets and stuff

148
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:47,790
like that so the story was the case
should not be any open especially being

149
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:56,660
New York so it's kind of true I mean you
don't want this key into wrong hands so

150
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,449
they made a story about it of course
they say he should not be open

151
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:08,539
this just in case that is not enough
interest for us

152
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:18,569
day showed that key on and no that's not
a clear picture but it's clear come on

153
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:27,260
guys should be the case is wrong so by
saying he shouldn't be out there they

154
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:36,330
put it out there keep on doing stuff
like that this is if you take a plastic

155
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,029
money credit cards are you done packing
machine and approaches numbers that's

156
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:50,889
money right so if I wanna sniff that a
non stop party in the old days which had

157
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:56,789
to do is more so plastic thingy and look
at convincing and put it over the the

158
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,610
credit card slip and make another deep
at that kind of looks like the original

159
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:10,799
enough to fool the normal user but was
that box and ATM or some some some some

160
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,779
money vending thing if I can get inside
that box so that I can put all my crap

161
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:22,320
we're inside the box and it will look
very closely and see it will look like

162
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,149
the real thing

163
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:28,989
guess what is the real thing human to
human interface machine interface is the

164
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,210
original think there's no way of telling
if that's if you get accepted that point

165
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:41,100
but with this story isn't investigated
casey's unbelievable that won gold in

166
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,209
case of a speaker unlike so many pops it
is a remedy from back in the day when

167
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,690
all gas station pumps were made with
this section

168
00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:08,050
he's providing high technology behind
here and able to rip off your credit or

169
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:29,490
debit in the nation universal gas that
easy to decode kinda 11 you would cost

170
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:49,820
about 50 cents one and if I buy them in
both the story another clip the New York

171
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:57,000
subway system that was the sales people
and those are the master key system

172
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,220
sometimes a master key system is heading
for example New York's big star

173
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:14,770
high-rise buildings if one of those
building is on fire when the fire

174
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,410
department can get it

175
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,730
of course they cannot read or down but I
don't want to do that on a regular basis

176
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:31,390
so city would be like a 60 perspective
perspective not so good cause everybody

177
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,730
who owns the building could get into any
sort of building so what they did they

178
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:43,420
started using boxes which is basically a
tiny says that is outside the actual

179
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:51,230
facility and it has the key to that
building inside that box has a lock on

180
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:58,659
it all those boxes are keyed alike and
sense and that he is

181
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:08,039
every fire station car fire truck that's
the terms are any fire truck will have

182
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:13,690
to a key so it's a good thing if if that
wouldn't be the case then they would

183
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,409
need to separate circuit for all the
keys that they need for the town of

184
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:29,609
course because that's done by lots miss
this particular locksmith did he was one

185
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:34,580
of the key cutting guys from the fire
department which part 11 they went to to

186
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,369
him among others to him that the
speakers at some point he went out of

187
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:46,999
business he was done working and he's
starting selling off some circles stuck

188
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:43,260
so a lot of newspaper start running this
story and nice wide backgrounds stretch

189
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,100
of pictures thank you very much

190
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:53,158
some even blew it up a bit more and
bigger also added exactly where that he

191
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,669
can be used red shoe to use and what you
can do without it

192
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:02,000
what you can do with it so this one
should be the last one should be what

193
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,149
you can do is shut off power to see the
whole or a police station that was a

194
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:12,699
strikeout of trading you could set all
the elevators in the Empire State

195
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,289
Building to the ground floor trippin
everybody in sight

196
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:22,850
fun stuff that's what is a traffic light
key so the life threat to the chaos

197
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:31,760
justify my 60 60 24 take over to Subway
or one World Trade Center this was some

198
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:39,360
time ago and actually seen that one
before the subway system so information

199
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,269
taking this is way more expensive than
if you just buy that before said guys

200
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:47,580
and the fire alarm box so you can

201
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,350
off

202
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:09,570
contacted just one movie but a question

203
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:23,429
story is it ok if we show these pictures
never duplicated he's a picture

204
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:38,330
to figure out who the actual dealer so
that's that's ok let's take it a bit

205
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:46,600
closer to home this is the logo for
taking place in Amsterdam Netherlands

206
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
sings my first race of course

207
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:58,529
basis to get himself rivals it it's more
like siblings and simply to do right now

208
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:08,610
and then and they got a new moves places
course that that also includes a new

209
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:14,668
front door and new keys and one of our
members would be a good age 22 told him

210
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:24,190
a bit so he contacted one of their
members just sent a picture of that we

211
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:40,200
have a guided that no sixties so we can
assess the security door to Europe again

212
00:25:40,200 --> 00:26:02,700
what you can do is just something like
this which was not a coffee maker and

213
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:23,200
later got so it puts on some plastic in
their lease on the label

214
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,049
good my dude is was a new machine
activation code word yet so you going

215
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:32,049
out

216
00:26:45,890 --> 00:27:48,300
which is due for a lot of a dog owner
tried it without breaking those laws of

217
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,610
course the next race which is open
source and share and share we put this

218
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,610
on a public wiki

219
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:13,779
and is nice but of course the day after
we came there with a way but along and

220
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:24,940
sixty spare keys installed it was good
and well but social engineering to get

221
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:43,690
all the details you need to open doors
again this is in charge and the story is

222
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:54,859
by speaker actually you could buy blocks
to the speaker has no idea how it works

223
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,859
but we were able to do so

224
00:29:39,710 --> 00:30:15,380
discussion on the need for coordinated
lift a leading up to these gusts

225
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,480
standing still

226
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:23,390
so locks like to get us just just
because because ok so from that tiny

227
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,390
video we listed a couple of steals

228
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:38,609
work better I think that's the money
shop its kinda straight on and if you

229
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:45,049
look at this he had Europe but if you
know your European case you go down

230
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:52,009
that's the BKS say Mr quick said we did
in the American story that's a big ass

231
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:59,389
and so the dimensions of the piano well
at least in this part we know what the

232
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:07,158
possible dimensions are from this this
is basically two BKS I'll see so these

233
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:14,259
are the position benefits can be a
possible death so we took this picture

234
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:21,549
and compare it with the Stars and did a
guesstimate and came up with it so we

235
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:31,149
thought that this would be the key to
all but again of course I'm sports

236
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:40,549
figure or have explicit permission from
actual owner to try this pretty sure

237
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:41,759
that's out the window

238
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:49,459
never gonna give permission for me to
try them so we bought this weekend sure

239
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:52,459
enough

240
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:08,669
showing he's wrong but actual as an
attacker having physical actually

241
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:19,640
possession of a key west of course some
key copying keys but but most of it is

242
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:29,789
done on profiles on blanks that we had
or could purchase but he also blocks

243
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:37,129
have a weird so the key always is also
reviewing stuff and some of those blanks

244
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,620
were not allowed to buy the nautilus
shell to you cause you don't have that

245
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,889
special permit or whatever

246
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:53,280
nobody else can make a piece of metal in
a certain shape of course we can use a

247
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,190
normal high risk pregnancy thing for
that but this is actually this is an

248
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:03,380
easy entry device that's the main it's a
box that basically does the same a shaky

249
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:11,320
copying machine just feel where the
regions are in drills that but this one

250
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,750
takes it from a different angle
literally it takes brass loves with my

251
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:24,810
smiley faces on it and basically does
normal copy machine would feel this site

252
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:34,609
that's what they told us is this site so
if Mills the groove on your key is more

253
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:42,149
close-up so it actually Mills those are
you end up with a blankie that you can

254
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:50,710
so it doesn't take that long but you
still have to have that machine to

255
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:57,839
decode if you want to do it on slot
machine is not she chief I mean for judy

256
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,020
has a couple of thousand dollars so for
a hobby store thats

257
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:11,800
its investment but series adversary NCR
care but just kind of high-tech ish not

258
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:26,970
high-tech with its tech you can get that
10 soldiers how are these made casting

259
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:34,770
casting is the magic word was going for
so you produce a more and cast metal in

260
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:40,580
there and and a vehicle off so it's not
like that anymore he come up with a

261
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:52,509
working key if he is not that high tech
so to tolerances are ok but quite normal

262
00:35:52,510 --> 00:36:00,000
you can take a piece of clay wk in there
makes you play nicely you need enough

263
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,240
and take it off slowly you will end up
with that you can actually use it we did

264
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:14,319
that indicate on the kitchen table when
do I care if you need if you have more

265
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:25,580
serious locks this is a low tolerance
for that you can use the normal clay and

266
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:33,650
we used to complement components and
actually to start at your dentist used

267
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,270
to make impressions from how you teach
law school

268
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:50,360
that stuff doesn't doesn't doesn't
shrink or expand when heated so much so

269
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:56,530
that's brilliant stuff they're actually
good for sales to say this to clamp the

270
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:02,270
said this is normal clay this is smokin
assessment not stupid versus these baby

271
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:07,250
powder actually cost what you do is if
you have a clay surface you put the baby

272
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,410
part of their actually put your key and
take it out on the clay will stick to

273
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:18,040
your sticky icky so to get rid of the
stickiness thats it is it is a low

274
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:27,340
melting metal and just a device to put
the claim it works it works so you've

275
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:32,390
seen this all doing in sixty James Bond
movies if this works as long as you

276
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:39,830
don't have to end up with the wheel
locks that the normal keeker consult

277
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:52,279
with adjustable states that this disc
locks but the important bits to work and

278
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:59,970
of course if you if you the casting bit
still have a more so if you're if you do

279
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,120
with me do you know you can try to over
and over again of course you can email

280
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:13,500
that will so losing sight of your key
for better part of 20 seconds so if you

281
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,680
lose sight of the key for the better
part of the settings you should consider

282
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:28,109
does peace if you find them afterwards
if you lose him in the wrong place and

283
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,490
the adversaries are watching us
sometimes you've known as the case it's

284
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:39,720
a goner she don't know whose owner of
those credentials cause that's what it

285
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,790
is he's our credentials

286
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:50,529
this is the idea of hope in the
Netherlands he's probably the most

287
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:57,430
famous hacker that we have we did stuff
with among others he's one of the guys

288
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,410
who make sure that we don't vote on
voting machines anymore so he had to

289
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:10,140
shit out of those guys who he's he's so
he's a hacker he said he's a good one so

290
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,140
he knows security let's see how he

291
00:40:42,030 --> 00:41:02,810
UF hackers in your nuclear bunker no way
in hell

292
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:14,860
definitely not an elevated which you
didn't know that you sharing this key

293
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:20,270
instead of the actual key took nothing
away from the story

294
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:26,120
tension was there the drama was there
and kept there you just show them a

295
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:33,270
problem anything so the story

296
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,300
keys

297
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:49,210
do not break so not showing he had to do
it well this is a key port labeled estan

298
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:55,480
they sell it also this is a basically a
box that you can slide your keys in

299
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:04,800
enough so she wanted you to use slide
out at least if if you have a lot of

300
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:15,430
peace dangling about what they do that
they produced he blames a head that shit

301
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:21,750
in here you can slide in and out of
course in order to know what key blanks

302
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:29,060
ship your actual keys to be caught by
your lovely but they do need to know

303
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:34,660
which place where they say the least

304
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:41,700
pictures of your he's to us and label
them correctly this is Dr Studio has my

305
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:52,169
front door and these defaults are at the
security conference you're selling a

306
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:58,030
security product to the group paranoid
that's what they are you telling to do

307
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,140
stuff like this

308
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:06,210
well actually drafted in the fine print
it does set security you can cover the

309
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:15,930
tip of your cuts it shouldn't be added
security it should be called that should

310
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:25,029
be in the fine print so well so we kind
of are catching on that this is a bad

311
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,380
idea

312
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:34,420
passport should not be on a post it on
your console is wrong and saying with

313
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,830
punching a credit card numbers I mean
couple years ago him especially in

314
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:45,350
Europe that I know we've got some
information clips that said if you

315
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:50,140
project your numbers don't let our
people know

316
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,390
facing you don't type in the past like
that if you know people watching me the

317
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:06,569
same goes with peace so you shouldn't
spreader and Yukihiro pictures of air so

318
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:13,390
this is wrong we all agree let so I
think this is wrong also this is pleased

319
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:26,859
break please break in his guy did make a
piece of software that that that looks

320
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:34,810
at the tree defeat and looks to
summarise a new key and has picture then

321
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:45,549
he put on this so right so we know that
these key these keys belong to a

322
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:53,240
location in our backlog of course these
are just things to the original

323
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,319
Twitter's so if you click on these links
you

324
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:03,020
and at the original twenty feet from the
actual owner figure out ways lease so

325
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:15,930
you can end up with stuff like this of
course if you click that link you get

326
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:24,140
him ready actually lives and I'm pretty
sure we can write some software that can

327
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:29,069
compare this to Google Maps Street View
I mean so

328
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:41,760
picture to actually opening so i think
is wrong so from a picture alone we can

329
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,970
decode enough information from a key to
actually open the lock so we kind of

330
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:53,089
want to know who's watching or if you
all watched well of course with Google

331
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:59,410
glass you can still love you could see
people wearing a stop on their head but

332
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:04,190
they're already working on Google
contact lenses and if you happen to live

333
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:11,200
in London says it closed circuit cameras
around and they they're getting better

334
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,310
and better I mean the picture quality is
better and better you don't see them all

335
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:24,590
you guys quite decent enough cash in
their pockets but those cameras and

336
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:33,460
tracking devices but who is watching so
you should be when you use your passport

337
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,210
to open your door

338
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:41,550
don't spread around anywhere I mean say
most people don't have opposed it fast

339
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,670
water before it gets what they suggest
what we're doing ok one more time story

340
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:51,269
this is a bad man

341
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:58,158
it was a bad man you got actually got
convicted for killing me to jail for a

342
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:09,890
master key was printed on the front of
the prisoners information handbook a

343
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:15,649
copy of that particular book was given
to all inmates upon arrival of passivity

344
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:30,729
showing information even if it's a tiny
bit as wrong as always security can be

345
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:40,669
hard to get easy but mostly it's quite
easy to follow and that's all I have any

346
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,670
questions

347
00:48:28,570 --> 00:49:46,700
concept that ok but yeah sure you're
right I mean if if you lose sight of

348
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:52,569
your piece of 22nd and then you find it
and it's all white and probably don't

349
00:49:52,570 --> 00:50:01,810
know what happened to make you question
so away keys fireman's keys were those

350
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:11,430
locks changed either too many of them to
change what what's the status that too I

351
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:16,899
don't knowingly so efficiently there's
no way for me to actually tell it first

352
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,540
I do not live in New York and I
allegedly do not have possession of

353
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,288
these keys

354
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:30,809
so i think is this vulnerability even
being reported is there anyone that

355
00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:36,309
cares about the reported in several
newspapers but it's a shit load of logs

356
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:46,609
and of course before their story ran
quite a lot of firemen in New York and

357
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:52,119
they don't all have their personal said
but it can get home and some of these

358
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,869
keys are even if the building is not a
fire are quite handy so you're sharing a

359
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:04,789
secret with a couple of thousand guys
share secrets with that amount of people

360
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:16,609
I mean if the group is big enough you
cannot share secrets so from a security

361
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:21,769
perspective like I said before former
security perspective having more sticky

362
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:30,109
distributed over a big group is a bad
idea from a safety perspective so it's

363
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:37,359
it's it's a ballast is just say we're
using usability and security i mean from

364
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:45,828
a security standpoint maybe pass what
this long would make sense so it's

365
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:52,219
always the balance in a choice you but
I'm pretty sure at least not all the

366
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:56,679
locks have been replaced pretty sure
both of them still I know for a fact

367
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:04,959
that the elevator key operational was
actually change out of los they're bound

368
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:07,049
by code

369
00:52:07,049 --> 00:52:12,299
the elevator code and I would determine
the actual writing however elevated key

370
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:13,409
should look like

371
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:18,890
clearly states this should be the key
this code should be the key so to change

372
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:26,230
all the paperwork that stuff I'm pretty
sure if not all I'm not sure

373
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:36,400
have you looked at ISO standards to see
if he information was revealed in there

374
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:48,680
so I saw standards I don't know what is
it subway systems or Gaza campaign but

375
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,669
those are standards yeah I mean you
guess cause I have no idea but for the

376
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:59,500
elevators in the standards it's it's
mandated that should be lucky if you

377
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:07,080
live in this area that sounds familiar I
just thank you very much

378
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,140
questions thank you very much
