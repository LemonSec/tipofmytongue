5
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,379
figured out something last night so I

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,430
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'd come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up here and present</font>

7
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:02,099
something real quick so yeah this is a

8
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:06,000
contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> info here I help run a torque on</font>

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,409
down to San Diego and I am part of like

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
the soap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ciphers project we're</font>

11
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,850
basically we're trying to get cool stuff

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,690
running on fpgas so mostly related to

13
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,038
crypto stuff but anything cool and here

14
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,220
Johnny Cash went you increase your job

15
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:21,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I'm a Johnny Cash I currently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hack</font>

16
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,700
on why are the stuff pretty extensively

17
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:26,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about most of my code</font>

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,679
a little bit later and I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Naval</font>

19
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:30,240
Postgraduate School and also i'll be

20
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:34,770
graduating September and looking for a

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,960
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> so uh hire me I guess people came</font>

22
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,789
true some self later when does a little

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing yeah you don't only doesn't need</font>

24
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to any injury</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction or anything</font>

25
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:48,540
so first thing I'm gonna go over cow

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,090
patty is anybody here that like heard of

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,960
cow patty at all yeah couple people

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">anybody heard of air crack yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font>

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,119
so yeah if you don't know what cow patty

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,089
is is basically a WPA cracker I just

31
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,960
stole a bunch of slides from

32
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,610
presentation that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> church</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Wi-Fi</font>

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,619
people gave and yeah I kind of signed up

34
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,110
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> church of Wi-Fi site like a few</font>

35
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">days ago and so I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT like officially</font>

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,489
a part of it but it's kind of pending I

37
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,299
guess they they weren't opposed to me

38
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:23,060
stealing their slides so then Johnny's

39
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:26,220
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about air base which is</font>

40
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,799
WEP cracking kind of framework that he

41
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,140
built he means 802 11 sleep by the way

42
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:36,810
it does there are children sweet yeah

43
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:39,279
sweet and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talk about like how</font>

44
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,069
everything ties together

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,750
so first I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal some slides</font>

46
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:51,850
here wow that works too<font color="#CCCCCC"> well it's</font>

47
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:54,209
twitching a lot in channel yeah so

48
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,440
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some like introduction stuff I</font>

49
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,050
haven't really read over these slides at

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,750
all so this is kind of a history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,040
church of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi if you think that you</font>

52
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,510
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on some cool Wi-Fi stuff</font>

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,220
just check out their website and sign up

54
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,780
and they got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:13,900
projects going this is just one of the

56
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:16,269
many of they presented on at<font color="#E5E5E5"> X mu con so</font>

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,480
they called this project basically

58
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:22,810
modifications to cow patty the<font color="#E5E5E5"> J dumbass</font>

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,010
project or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dumas if you're French or</font>

60
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,569
something like that and basically a cow

61
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,310
patty normally you'd kind of like

62
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,170
capture some data and then run it

63
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,790
through like a huge word list and see

64
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,399
which word list matches you know the

65
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,019
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you collected and they just</font>

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,459
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it so they could</font>

67
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:41,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">pre-compute all this stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

68
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:43,780
like really easy and dumb passwords that

69
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,190
people usually choose and so you can

70
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,260
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> precompute everything ahead of time</font>

71
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know like scan through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

72
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,040
list really quickly and and brute force

73
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything like while you're driving</font>

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,859
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a city and stuff so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee has</font>

75
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,959
access points come up he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just look</font>

76
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,000
through a file if it matches and you

77
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,280
know you have you've cracked the network

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,810
and you can just move on so yeah they

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just tried to speed everything up</font>

80
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,049
and catch the low-hanging fruit with

81
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,180
this so yeah they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they called the J</font>

82
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:14,799
dumbass project because as an user J

83
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:17,650
dumbass and yeah a dumbass<font color="#E5E5E5"> has his</font>

84
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,090
username as his password so yeah just

85
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:24,849
just basic passwords they wanted to

86
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:26,049
easily check for so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover</font>

87
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more in detail so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just</font>

88
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip over this right now</font>

89
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,520
essentially they they want to make it as

90
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,020
a standalone application and they ended

91
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,130
up just modifying cow patty they got

92
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,620
Josh<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to do all the modifications</font>

93
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,300
and so they built this new program jen p

94
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:46,270
MK has anybody mess around with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

95
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:47,650
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah butyl ok yeah yeah so it's</font>

96
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,210
basically cow patty but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it creates the</font>

97
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,710
hash file and then you can use cow patty

98
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,760
to look up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hash file instead of</font>

99
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually computing everything</font>

100
00:04:53,969 --> 00:05:04,539
so they basically took the top default

101
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:07,029
ssids and and ran it through jen p MK

102
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:08,979
because essentially with them when

103
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:11,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're computing your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p.m. k the set s</font>

104
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,909
society is kind of like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> salt and so</font>

105
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:14,529
you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just compute a hash table and</font>

106
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:15,938
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for any SSID it's for a</font>

107
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:18,399
particular a society that you compute it

108
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:21,489
for so they took the top thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSIDs</font>

109
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,249
and used a perl script to basically like

110
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:27,219
run a gem tmk on all these cells in s

111
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:28,659
societies for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a given word list and it</font>

112
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:30,998
essentially makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like rainbow</font>

113
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:36,369
tables for wpa but is dependent on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

114
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:39,429
SSID so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they did at</font>

115
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:44,909
shmoocon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to talk a little</font>

116
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:50,768
bit how we expanded<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole thing so</font>

117
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:54,789
yeah so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just go on to the meat</font>

118
00:05:50,769 --> 00:06:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and stuff so essentially how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wpa works</font>

119
00:05:54,789 --> 00:06:03,550
is you basically have your master key

120
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,259
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passphrase and that</font>

121
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,749
gets hashed and turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a pair wise</font>

122
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:10,749
master key which actually is used with

123
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:12,309
like your whole actual connection like

124
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:15,969
setting packets and authentication and

125
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:17,889
the less sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff and basically</font>

126
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:19,689
what's used to transform the master key

127
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,029
into the pairwise master master key is

128
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:27,159
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> pv kdf to function which is</font>

129
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:31,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually an RSA standard and essentially</font>

130
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:34,089
what what pbk df2 is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sha 1h</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac</font>

131
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,339
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> run like essentially about 32,000</font>

132
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:38,589
times total all<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shah ones run about</font>

133
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:40,329
three two thousand times Sean 1h mac is

134
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:43,539
ran about like eight thousand times and

135
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:45,519
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the basic algorithm it</font>

136
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:47,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically Shaolin H Mac like your master</font>

137
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,379
key which is your passphrase and your

138
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:53,438
SSID and just like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little counter</font>

139
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,999
identifier which is one up here and then

140
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,879
you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that output and loop it back</font>

141
00:06:54,999 --> 00:07:00,369
into into sha-1<font color="#CCCCCC"> H Mac is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the input and</font>

142
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,409
do that four thousand times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

143
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:04,179
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shaolin H Mac</font>

144
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,670
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the first 20 bytes of your</font>

145
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:08,000
hash

146
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:10,280
and then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it with a</font>

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,510
counter of one and do another<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4,000</font>

148
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,419
times so this is really time consuming

149
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,980
it takes forever on a PC and I'll get

150
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the performance stuff but it's</font>

151
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,590
extremely slow if you're trying to you

152
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:24,290
know go through tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass phrases so</font>

153
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,729
when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sha1 looked in depth</font>

154
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,920
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> sha-1 because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was implementing</font>

155
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,830
this on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGA and I wanted to optimize</font>

156
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,100
some of the stuff so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

157
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,960
sha-1<font color="#E5E5E5"> H Mac is you take your data and</font>

158
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,080
you XOR it with like a constant which is

159
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,880
5c<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have an inner shell one where</font>

160
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,280
you XOR your master key with a constant

161
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,750
over here and basically that whole

162
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,669
output of this whole function ends up

163
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,540
being you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the t value over here</font>

164
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,090
so one thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool with</font>

165
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is that inside the sha-1 functions</font>

166
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,320
the master key is never changing and

167
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,760
your ex soaring it with a constant<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font>

168
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,409
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> value right here it can be</font>

169
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,300
cached and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to compute</font>

170
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,650
that shot one every time so you

171
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,220
basically start out with that value and

172
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,960
just like it saves you let's see you

173
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,120
have a total of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like four shot ones here</font>

174
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">so it cuts that the mound in half and so</font>

175
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,410
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even do some cool optimizations</font>

176
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,750
like that see ya then essentially once

177
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,270
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that then you just analyze the</font>

178
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,010
network traffic and then try a certain a

179
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,240
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> master key certain passphrase</font>

180
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if it matches up then you know that</font>

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have the right key so it's kind of</font>

182
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know basic sort of password</font>

183
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,409
cracking you just brute force everything

184
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:41,110
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended up building the stuff on an</font>

185
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:44,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">FPGA that uses eight sha-1 cores and</font>

186
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,220
uses block Ram to buffer all the

187
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,630
different pass phrases or going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

188
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:52,580
sha-1 course and then I it's basically

189
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,170
set up kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a FIFO where as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

190
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,180
as machine is able to fill the buffer

191
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,550
then you can get full utilization on all

192
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,530
the cores and when you start like

193
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,880
running slow on filling it then it just

194
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,620
drops down the performance a little bit

195
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into how that works a little</font>

196
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:11,960
bit so essentially you have your

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer and your huge buffer where</font>

198
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,540
you're storing all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the all the</font>

199
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,170
different pass phrases that you're going

200
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:24,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try and so you fill</font>

201
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:25,370
like the slot 0 here<font color="#CCCCCC"> slot 1 2 and you</font>

202
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,540
fill it all the way down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like the</font>

203
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,420
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the buffer which in this case</font>

204
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,589
is 255 and so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> your whole buffer is</font>

205
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,589
filled with different passphrases you

206
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:36,139
want to feed into the Shaolin<font color="#E5E5E5"> course and</font>

207
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:37,880
then you basically have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGA code</font>

208
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:41,510
that takes out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those buffers feeds</font>

209
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,070
them over to the shot one<font color="#E5E5E5"> cores and then</font>

210
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer over here is just kind of</font>

211
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,180
waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this whole block to finish</font>

212
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,769
one step<font color="#E5E5E5"> block finishes and it moves on</font>

213
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,300
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next block here then it starts</font>

214
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:55,100
filling up here so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

215
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,479
you'd if you start running slow on

216
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,399
filling up the table then it can still

217
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,410
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these values down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to 255</font>

218
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,269
and still like fully utilize all the

219
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">cores and you don't end up with any sort</font>

220
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:07,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like performance loss and stuff so I</font>

221
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,680
don't know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really simple sort</font>

222
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,449
of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifo thing that I</font>

223
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,849
threw together and it works pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

224
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:16,219
for this so the end up kind of

225
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,709
developing custom sort of buffering

226
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,180
schemes to like get extra performance

227
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:22,339
out of things when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing is</font>

228
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,910
hardware so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one thing I three</font>

229
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,760
together so here here's some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

230
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:31,670
performance results with cow patty<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

231
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,040
pentium<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 I was getting about 25 per</font>

232
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,849
second like so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually only</font>

233
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,829
try 25 per second on 3.6 gigahertz<font color="#E5E5E5"> p4</font>

234
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,930
like my laptop I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting about 60</font>

235
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:45,229
per second a friend of mine tried on

236
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:48,859
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> highest end AMD system that he</font>

237
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,680
had he got about 70 beetle tried it on

238
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,010
his intel core duo and on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> macbook</font>

239
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he got about 70 with cow patty</font>

240
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,279
supposedly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get like a hundred</font>

241
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,589
hundred plus has anybody done any

242
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,399
performance like stuff with<font color="#E5E5E5"> air crack on</font>

243
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,839
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc no least try that okay well it's</font>

244
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:11,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">bilious a bit faster because they use</font>

245
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,769
MMX so on the fpga on one of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-end</font>

246
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,779
cards which is basically just this

247
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:19,040
little compact flash size card as

248
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,750
getting about 430 per second and in this

249
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,019
cluster this machine right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do</font>

250
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 6500 per second and on our</font>

251
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:27,440
higher-end cards that are about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the size</font>

252
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,990
of a pcmcia card i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get about a</font>

253
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
thousand per second per card

254
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:38,740
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 15,000 for a system like</font>

255
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:41,770
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so render man already</font>

256
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,680
computed like he did like the top

257
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:47,860
thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> passphrases for the top dolls</font>

258
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">in SSIDs and his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next goal was to do the</font>

259
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">top million passphrases for the top</font>

260
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,149
dolls in s societies and so he started

261
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,320
computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on his cluster and it</font>

262
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:59,500
took him<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a month</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font>

263
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,870
this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and then he found out</font>

264
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> returned characters at the</font>

265
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:08,410
end of every line and so I left you have

266
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:12,370
returned characters in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your society yeah</font>

267
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:15,040
he was kind of screwed so yeah after

268
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,660
computing for a month so he sent me<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

269
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,459
email and he sounded<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of pathetic</font>

270
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,800
he's like oh you know can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you help me</font>

271
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,540
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> please and so i coded this thing up</font>

272
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,910
i finally got it working and actually

273
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">started this cracking the same sort of</font>

274
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,529
job earlier this week like on tuesday

275
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,330
and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished it before I left for</font>

276
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:35,649
coming to the conference and basically

277
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:39,010
took two days like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 hours and actually</font>

278
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,750
I have DVDs it's 40 gigs worth of stuff

279
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have dvds here that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

280
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,709
give out at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the talk I've got</font>

281
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:52,930
four sets here so good questions will

282
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:57,209
get DVDs later and thanks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot to a guy</font>

283
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,209
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there selling the dvds what's that</font>

284
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,240
let me use the use the burner last night

285
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,709
so it saved a lot of time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

286
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a demonstration it's basically cow</font>

287
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:13,750
patty running on fpgas with some perl

288
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:16,350
scripts involved so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just run</font>

289
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">through this real quick</font>

290
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,050
here

291
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:50,139
ah so i'm using<font color="#CCCCCC"> rendell man's account</font>

292
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:55,170
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so yeah he he basically just</font>

293
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:58,420
hooked together some perl scripts run

294
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,250
yeah this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just as perl script</font>

295
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,229
is using for for computing the tables

296
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's really simple just like reads</font>

297
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,180
in a file of s ascites and then just

298
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:09,130
spits off jen p MK for everything so

299
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:16,180
it's a total<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hackford just computing</font>

300
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:18,519
stuff and building all these tables so

301
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:23,529
first I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you how fast this runs</font>

302
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:29,949
on on the pc here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a full</font>

303
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:31,569
dictionary file which is see 10,000

304
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,219
lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's only like four</font>

305
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:35,709
thousand that actually are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

306
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,470
eight characters yeah and if you

307
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,180
actually look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I put the actual</font>

308
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:44,110
passphrase for this test is family movie

309
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,699
night at the very bottom so that's what

310
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,519
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGA basically four</font>

311
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:49,930
thousand i created one for this demo

312
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,079
because it would take way too long doing

313
00:14:49,930 --> 00:15:00,310
it on the real computer here let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

314
00:14:53,079 --> 00:15:02,019
small one so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small one is like less</font>

315
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,529
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> three hundred and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it should be</font>

316
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:06,819
pretty fast so I i just might play these

317
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,810
little scripts so I didn't screw up the

318
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:15,029
demo here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this basically just runs</font>

319
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:19,479
cow patty with the test dump file with

320
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:21,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">dictionary oh yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> faster with addiction</font>

321
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,300
to the small dictionary and ness<font color="#CCCCCC"> society</font>

322
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">of something clever so</font>

323
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,480
so took<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds it did about 44</font>

324
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,270
passphrases per seconds that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

325
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:44,320
bad now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to run it on one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

326
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:46,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGAs in this cluster here and i</font>

327
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,640
just added the cat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dash capital F</font>

328
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,860
option on to here and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do</font>

329
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,750
dash capital F and the index<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the FPGA</font>

330
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,880
you want to talk to and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

331
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:59,050
offloads everything to that so its exact

332
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,460
same cow patty syntax for everything so

333
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:05,199
right now it's going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

334
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:11,380
pass phrases yeah yeah yeah it's just

335
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:13,570
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them so did 434 passphrase per</font>

336
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,790
second and found<font color="#E5E5E5"> family movie night as a</font>

337
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:21,820
as a pre-shared key went through four

338
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:23,650
thousand and 9.4 seconds and if you've

339
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,040
looked at jen p MK it's it's kind of the

340
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:34,540
same signet syntax is cow patty so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

341
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:37,719
just run that real quick so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just run</font>

342
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,380
jen p MK with a hash file dictionary

343
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,380
SSID

344
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,980
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for the same really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

345
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:58,250
word list with something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 past or</font>

346
00:16:48,980 --> 00:17:00,860
89<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass phrases in it and then then you</font>

347
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,870
just run cow patty with the dash kappa d

348
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,540
option you specify the hash file that

349
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,880
you generated and it just goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

350
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:12,709
and uses the hash file instead of

351
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,959
computing so 16 2000 per second you can

352
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,339
look up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hash flow so it's quite a</font>

353
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:23,600
quite a bit faster once you actually

354
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:27,250
compute everything and see so here's

355
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">here is it on the FPGA for the big one</font>

356
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,490
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll take the same amount of time as</font>

357
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,490
the cow patty<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

358
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:50,168
so there's the hash file and I just

359
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,168
looks it up and it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast right</font>

360
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:56,330
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

361
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,860
one of these dvds or you bit too are

362
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,668
numb or download them off a website or

363
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">something all you have to do is I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

364
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:06,710
this test file that render man sent me

365
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,990
and like if I'm trying to crack a

366
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:13,580
linksys access point he's got this

367
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:17,210
capture file linksys 01 cap so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

368
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,699
do is specify your hash file I've got

369
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:23,799
like a linksys hash pilot here that's

370
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:29,659
each one of these is about 40 Meg's and

371
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:34,960
see specify your capture file and a

372
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:34,960
society which is linksys of course I

373
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:44,590
think it's towards the end I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

374
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:44,590
yeah

375
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,270
there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are yeah so yeah that's</font>

376
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,550
basically it if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get one of</font>

377
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,139
these one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these dvds here try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

378
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:10,790
and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can crack some cool stuff</font>

379
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it yeah yeah yeah we'll probably</font>

380
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">put them up on a website where you can</font>

381
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,980
just download the<font color="#E5E5E5"> links this one and so</font>

382
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,090
yeah once you stumble on something you

383
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,550
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just download the file for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

384
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,040
particular one or if you want you can

385
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,080
email me and I'll like compute like a

386
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,690
few billion word word lists or whatever

387
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,689
for her like that particular SSID

388
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:49,100
probably faster to compute him so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

389
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,510
last night<font color="#CCCCCC"> beetle tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking</font>

390
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,790
around at some of the stuff with<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS X</font>

391
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,100
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PMK stuff and he found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

392
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,210
cool stuff so I I just wanted to have

393
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,980
him explain something that seemed pretty

394
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:02,720
cool yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> real quick um you know I</font>

395
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,760
like there's IW config for linux and

396
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,350
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and OS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x is pretty n</font>

397
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">scott it's got nice little stuff for you</font>

398
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">to point and click and i think it was</font>

399
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">like two years ago or so that I figured</font>

400
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to write IW config for like</font>

401
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,640
windows XP because I couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand like</font>

402
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,070
you know having to change as this idea a

403
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,450
GUI so look for wireless weapons of mass

404
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,100
destruction for windows and you'll find

405
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">out how to write IW config for windows</font>

406
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,439
XP so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was thinking well just do the</font>

407
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">same thing for OS X right and lo and</font>

408
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,460
behold they've already done it I'm like

409
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,200
yay because they were smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough right</font>

410
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,080
there working off a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bsd subsystem so I</font>

411
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,940
mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great this happens to hide in</font>

412
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,889
system library private frameworks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple</font>

413
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,360
802 dot11 dot framework virgins current

414
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,340
resources and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> command called</font>

415
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,870
airport and you can do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of</font>

416
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">command-line stuff just like I did we</font>

417
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,590
config with the airport command so if

418
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,090
you type<font color="#CCCCCC"> airport desk h you'll get like</font>

419
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,459
all sorts of crazy stuff so you can do

420
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,629
manual scanning you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> join</font>

421
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,770
the different network you can change

422
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,150
your preferences you could look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

423
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,560
actual depreciate keys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you already</font>

424
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,990
have stored for your current networks

425
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,330
that sort of thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking I</font>

426
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,700
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's great but</font>

427
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I saw wait a second there's just a</font>

428
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,440
regular flag that lets you just generate

429
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,690
a pre-shared key or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pmk for a</font>

430
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:15,970
particular SSID which is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

431
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:17,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">gen p.m. k is for cow patty so as long</font>

432
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate a whole</font>

bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p.m. case for a particular SSID</font>

434
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,060
you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a shell script</font>

435
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,680
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS X by default you don't have to</font>

436
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,159
download anything else but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

437
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">performance is not great I don't be</font>

438
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:38,140
silly sure go back yeah system library

439
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:40,540
private frameworks then Apple 802<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot11</font>

440
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,510
dot framework from from from ford /

441
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,100
versions fork / current /resources and

442
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,180
then there's a command<font color="#E5E5E5"> called airport</font>

443
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,709
that sits there yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i MA and the first</font>

444
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,030
half the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was like you</font>

445
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,510
know create a symbolic link and use your

446
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:59,530
husband right see it's nicer to have it

447
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the path right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a performance wise</font>

448
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,160
here's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the show street or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

449
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,510
a little bit pearl that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote and okay</font>

450
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,110
this is all it does it just basically

451
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,610
takes a dictionary file and then runs

452
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,139
runs the airport command with those

453
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,399
flags on that particular society and

454
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,530
then creates like your<font color="#CCCCCC"> PM case for you</font>

455
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,300
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is that this format and</font>

456
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,670
what it's creating here isn't an actual

457
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,770
hash isn't an actual hash table it's

458
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,150
readable by cow patty but I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

459
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,410
to figure that out right then I didn't

460
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,790
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly how he was storing like the</font>

461
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">header on his hash file to determine</font>

462
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,060
what the SSID was so I was going to do

463
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for later so later on it'll it'll</font>

464
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,600
actually do this I'll maybe I'll throw

465
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,520
an update on like my website or

466
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,550
something like that anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you run it</font>

467
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,050
you get about 10 10 10 and a half

468
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,659
passphrases per second that you're

469
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,340
actually generating which is decent in

470
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,870
comparison to like pentium tues or

471
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,980
whatever but what's nice is that you've

472
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you're doing this on</font>

473
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,100
you know a macbook then you've got you

474
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,510
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to processor so you can run</font>

475
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,520
it twice and you actually get better

476
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:54,910
utilization you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 passwords per</font>

477
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:59,290
second if you guys single core you're

478
00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:00,430
sucking now what's interesting is that I

479
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,690
thought this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of cool and I</font>

480
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,270
thought well I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I'll do this in</font>

481
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,620
comparison to you know Jen p.m. case and

482
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,210
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to compile jen p MK and of</font>

483
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,669
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't compile cleanly on OSX</font>

484
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,190
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i commented out a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

485
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,570
includes and then jen p MK does run OSX

486
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">i have gotten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ID running on there</font>

487
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:20,559
but what's nice is that you can act

488
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:22,179
to get about 35 36 / poor and so you end

489
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,639
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing about 70 passphrase per second</font>

490
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,380
with jen p MK so josh is still got the

491
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,730
cool shit with jen p MK don't think

492
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this shell script replaces that</font>

493
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,309
name any way shape or form but it's just

494
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,659
kind of cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can actually just</font>

495
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this on the fly with the shell script</font>

496
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool thanks a lot no there isn't WK</font>

497
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,880
to support yet I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

498
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,210
difference is that wpa2 uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES instead</font>

499
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,500
of shot one and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

500
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,080
actually end up being faster to do on

501
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:03,279
fpgas but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't really looked at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

502
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:06,189
much so oh go ahead oh ok yeah so that

503
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,960
yeah it's just I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the job right is</font>

504
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,770
going to be doing some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of support</font>

505
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,789
for wpa2 in dekalb addy and if somebody

506
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,500
else comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out with something</font>

507
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:18,600
before then I'll probably do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGA</font>

508
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,600
support for it okay go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

509
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:34,250
uh yeah sure um yeah yeah the this

510
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,160
company that I helped start we

511
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:41,870
manufacture see I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cards in</font>

512
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:44,180
my bag over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there he's alone okay so</font>

513
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:47,840
this is actually a compact flash card

514
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:50,770
like inside a pcmcia adapter and it's

515
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty small but basically this thing</font>

516
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,030
plugs into a pcmcia adapter and then it

517
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,179
plugs into a pcmcia<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pci adapter and</font>

518
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:02,000
this motherboard kind of a backplane

519
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,940
things supports up to 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI cards and</font>

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,920
this actually has two motherboard blades

521
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,520
in it so there's two motherboards in

522
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,170
here and one can do like eight PCI cards

523
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:19,910
another one can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do seven so it's a total</font>

524
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:21,830
of fifteen yeah yeah they're they're

525
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:25,970
these little tiny things inside like

526
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:28,189
yeah 22 adapter is basically into PCI

527
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,930
into the motherboard yeah so it's

528
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">totally like off-the-shelf hardware that</font>

529
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:42,020
we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together just to have a</font>

530
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:43,850
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these in a single machine these</font>

531
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,920
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sell on our website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PECO</font>

532
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,959
computing com<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll have a link at it</font>

533
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">link for it later on the presentation</font>

534
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,710
but these are pretty expensive so I

535
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if your company is paying</font>

536
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">forth and that's cool if you're trying</font>

537
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do something by yourself you can buy</font>

538
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:59,210
like pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap Ebell boards from</font>

539
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,350
different places and they're a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

540
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,760
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set up you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

541
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,050
spend a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time like building</font>

542
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,500
interface to actually talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font>

543
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,500
stuff but

544
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,180
oh yeah yeah these are really convenient

545
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,910
I mean you just pop them in and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

546
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,770
start doing dev work and stuff so but

547
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,750
yeah they they're really expensive

548
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:22,370
manufacturers that's mostly why they're

549
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:27,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">really expensive this box right here is</font>

550
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:33,800
like 50,000 each card is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,500 so</font>

551
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:36,230
yeah it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little pricey if you you can</font>

552
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,030
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and buy some dev boards like if</font>

553
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go into xilinx calm and search</font>

554
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,139
around for dev boards they range between

555
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,320
like maybe 300 and like five or six

556
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,720

559
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,220
you want to play around with those and

560
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,780
the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have up on</font>

561
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,960
open ciphers you should be able to port

562
00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:01,610
it to pretty much anything it's all yeah

563
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:07,010
it's all pretty open so go ahead it's on

<font color="#E5E5E5">Verilog on that PGA any other questions</font>

566
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,960
bottom then some so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could do the</font>

567
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:19,470
stupid

568
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,870
uh yeah there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a whole lot</font>

569
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a whole lot of bandwidth going</font>

570
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,760
between you know the computer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

571
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,830
cards because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only doing like 400</font>

572
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,410
per second per card and that's maybe

573
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,830
averaging like 50 bytes per like

574
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,840
passphrase or something so I mean it's

575
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,699
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much bandwidth if you consider</font>

576
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,830
like you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast the pci bus can</font>

577
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,360
go up to but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was running into some</font>

578
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,980
limitations with up with eight of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

579
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,659
where they're kind of like fighting over

580
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,610
the bus and so is it wasn't running as

581
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,350
fast as it could have been so it may be

582
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,810
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like 380 per second</font>

583
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">average over across all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight well as</font>

584
00:27:51,810 --> 00:28:02,129
seven it was working perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine go</font>

585
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:05,570
ahead packets um six or yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

586
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,570
it's a 4 Way handshake that we had

587
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:17,820
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here oh yeah yeah these</font>

588
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,350
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> four I think that yeah there's</font>

589
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,090
some sort of like for a handshake thing

590
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:25,500
that goes on or something I don't the

591
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:31,740
earth wait Hey Ya Ya sort of kind of

592
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:33,030
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> distorted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there see I</font>

593
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to capture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

594
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:38,100
thing or something I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just I</font>

595
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,930
just crack the codes I don't really I

596
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,530
don't really mess around with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

597
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:44,580
stuff yeah so yeah um see I Johnny's

598
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,320
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about your base now if</font>

599
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,320
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any other questions oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

600
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:08,370
um yeah well okay so so like say you

601
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,770
know cow patty does like 70 per second

602
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">or something like that then yeah like</font>

603
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:17,400
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these does forty three or four</font>

604
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:20,370
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thirty times 15 so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6500 /</font>

605
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's yeah yeah basically about a hundred</font>

606
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:28,610
laptops yeah 100 dual-core until

607
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:31,290
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that yeah so yeah so it</font>

608
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:34,199
so if you can buy a hundred laptops for

609
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:36,240
fifty thousand dollars and it's yeah

610
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:41,580
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably drives withdraws a lot</font>

611
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,590
less current than 100 laptops though and

612
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:48,330
it's green yeah yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's green it's</font>

613
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:49,800
green that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost extra yeah leavin you</font>

614
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,360
leavin<font color="#CCCCCC"> still it was like like some</font>

615
00:29:49,800 --> 00:30:01,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">bling-bling lights and the spoiler on</font>

616
00:29:51,360 --> 00:30:05,550
the back to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions decals</font>

617
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:08,670
everybody else all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay go for</font>

618
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:10,889
Johnny<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk</font>

619
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,780
about air base for a little bit because

620
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,670
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we've done so method is</font>

621
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,160
hardware accelerated<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> c4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside a</font>

622
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,260
left boot for sir Justin quite as sexy

623
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,680
as brute forcing<font color="#E5E5E5"> WPA but still you know</font>

624
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:24,030
get your bases covered and so uh talk

625
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,100
about Air Base Air Base is actually a

626
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,930
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just an 80 tool or a WEP</font>

627
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,429
password cracker and since i'm talking

628
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,740
about it i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go over so many other</font>

629
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,850
features very briefly because I wrote

630
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,870
them and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like people to start using</font>

631
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:41,840
it hyperlinks and powerpoints this is

632
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:45,540
amazing i think i could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this okay</font>

633
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,250
eres eres has pretty much three large

634
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,620
components to it it's got air where

635
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,980
which is a library written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> c++ and</font>

636
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:56,340
it's got JC wet crack JC aircrack and a

637
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,680
bunch of tools JC aircrack is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mairi</font>

638
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,620
implementation of air crack it's uh it's

639
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,500
written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> c++ and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's way easier to</font>

640
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,939
read than<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christoph's aircrack that it</font>

641
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,140
has less features<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not going to say</font>

642
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,210
it's particularly

643
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,590
sure yet but it's definitely easier to

644
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:15,000
experiment with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show off some</font>

645
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:16,050
other things it does then a JC web crack

646
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,970
is the thing we've actually gotten

647
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware accelerated so far that's just</font>

648
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,200
a plain old Bucky brute force or

649
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:25,530
redistributed you know looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at like</font>

650
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,300
city at home cracking WEP keys and tools

651
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,530
has a bunch of other utilities I'm going

652
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,419
to mention briefly because you're really

653
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:35,910
handy if you're into developing wireless

654
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:42,990
tools assuming my spacebar works what

655
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:48,020
button does this take<font color="#CCCCCC"> none of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

656
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:54,450
the frozen it is frozen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

657
00:31:48,020 --> 00:32:03,770
hyperlinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and PowerPoint a bad idea all</font>

658
00:31:54,450 --> 00:32:03,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">right this takes two hands hahahaha oh</font>

659
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:20,100
meet all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the info yeah beach bah you</font>

660
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:30,380
can't see this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft's crash</font>

661
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:30,379
reporter crashed hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

662
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:56,190
okay so no no hyperlinks in this version

663
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:59,580
worked fine with the other one it did<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

664
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">where is there</font>

665
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:22,530
okay much better all right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> reversed</font>

666
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:24,680
it is me<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus I had this all working</font>

667
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,680
before

668
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,590
one more time I'm a brilliant computer

669
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,640
scientist I swear I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't work</font>

670
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:44,730
Microsoft products all right it does

671
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,550
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so as I was saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> airbase</font>

672
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,170
there's three major components air crack

673
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,180
WEP crack and a bunch of tools and they

674
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,460
all use the same library everywhere

675
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,810
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've this started as a bunch of</font>

676
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,640
legacy code I had written so many

677
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,590
different wireless utilities and I was

678
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,780
so tired of maintaining different code

679
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,510
bases i spent like<font color="#E5E5E5"> two months and rotor</font>

680
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,980
but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's badass c++ library to</font>

681
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,240
do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me so if there's any</font>

682
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,800
function that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever had to write twice</font>

683
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,179
inside any of these things they got

684
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,469
crammed in the area where for better or

685
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:15,120
worse so so I just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the tools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

686
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:17,609
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> included in this briefly there's a</font>

687
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,168
pcap to air file so that those what

688
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine and take a peek app and</font>

689
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:24,899
inject it a pcap web crypt which is a

690
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:27,480
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> program to decrypt and encrypt</font>

691
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:29,310
you know peek at with web it's got some

692
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,870
more useful features for developers you

693
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,779
can specify things on the command<font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font>

694
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:36,120
like I'd like to encrypt this packet end

695
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,669
times with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this probability of a week</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

696
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:42,089
ve or set this IV to this so it gives

697
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:44,699
you a little more power than some<font color="#E5E5E5"> error</font>

698
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:46,139
test is a nice unit tester for air where

699
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,449
and it does actually have some features

700
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,270
prints out pcap so it will do some web

701
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:52,739
benchmarking prism strip is a little

702
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,960
program that's poorly named that'll

703
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,930
prism headers but actually it will strip

704
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,000
out abs headers and you want to believe

705
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">the number of crappy ways people write</font>

706
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,690
down pcap files it's terrible they'll

707
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,460
set the data link type to this but then

708
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">will append a 4-byte frame checksum</font>

709
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,000
which shouldn't be there<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe it</font>

710
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,339
should but you can't tell handles all

711
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,630
that for you actually the library

712
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,060
handles all that for you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

713
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,800
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it simple replay is a little</font>

714
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,660
program that will just replay packets on

715
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,250
one interface or just kind of nice so it

716
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,440
sits there and you can tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> replay a</font>

717
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,420
data packet with this probability or you

718
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,050
can tweak it to do over<font color="#E5E5E5"> only whatever</font>

719
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,060
packets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> craft test is a little</font>

720
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:31,410
program and it'll just run through the

721
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,600
different crafters to show you how easy

722
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,770
it is to craft ferries packets none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

723
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are directly really related to</font>

724
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,700

725
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,879
he can't replicate

726
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,819
handy so let's get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the</font>

727
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,190
cracking utilities first we have JC

728
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,410
aircrack a reimplement ation of you know

729
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:53,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever popular statistical attacks against</font>

730
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:55,410

731
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:58,140

733
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,859
out and says XXX don't put this in so

734
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,720
anyway so there's a JC aircrack binary<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

735
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:08,730
have my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own version of i wrote my own</font>

737
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,680
be able to run aircrack in real time on

738
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,180
a mac and the version that<font color="#E5E5E5"> christophe</font>

740
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,890
doesn't run on OSX in real time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:22,109
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this version of aero dunk to you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">mac and fiddle with it correctly it's</font>

746
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the easiest thing to do but it does</font>

748
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,009
problem however other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pretty</font>

749
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,050
much free and said everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else pcap</font>

750
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">two IVs murdered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IVs those do probably</font>

751
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,020
what you think they will and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

752
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,730
all file compatible and buffer

753
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,670
compatible even with aircrack so if you

754
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,619
wanted to run my arrow dump on<font color="#E5E5E5"> OSX and</font>

755
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,030
actually Christoph's aircrack on OSX

756
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,990
using you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll talk to each</font>

757
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:57,660
other just fine so that's bc aircrack

758
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,919
and here's a screenshot in case

759
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,098
something goes bad with my computer

760
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:06,200
while I try to demo it hopefully we

761
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,200
won't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshot it's a second</font>

762
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

763
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:33,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay so here I am sis the latest</font>

764
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:35,570
version release of<font color="#E5E5E5"> air base which isn't</font>

00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,600
actually up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my webpage yet but it</font>

766
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,920
will be shortly i hope i've just not

767
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:46,490
brave enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> post a virgin server</font>

768
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:48,410
facing the internet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a got a</font>

769
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:51,379
little script here that's generally

770
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use pcap wept ripped to uh to</font>

771
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,910
generate some pcap files for an air

772
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,620
crack against and you know it's not as

773
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">good as cat capturing packets in real</font>

774
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:09,620
time but at least it's not that much

775
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:13,069
tricks up my sleeve right so so it's a

776
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:15,680
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cat flap trip to generate easier</font>

777
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,540
like pcap files that are easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

778
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,890
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crack with more packets in</font>

779
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,960
more week<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've used so you can kind of</font>

780
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,950
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the cool runs and later you'll</font>

781
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,340
see how we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accelerate a</font>

782
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,779
second so it's a now saves you time from

783
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:32,420
actually trying to collect this data you

784
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:35,000
just generate it but what does this work

785
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">with them with like access points of</font>

786
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,710
filter week IVs uh you see access points

787
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">there plenty of access points that will</font>

788
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,830
filter week I we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pains they</font>

789
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,900
won't use them but there's nothing that

790
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,850
can stop an old client from using them

791
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,260
so you got some old windows box saying

792
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with a crappy driver and it's</font>

793
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,580
still gonna you know use these<font color="#CCCCCC"> week IVs</font>

794
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,050
and it's also it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that easy to</font>

795
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,790
filter them as people think there's the

796
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,340
classically weak ones that everybody

797
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,990
knows about with ffs but there's a 17

798
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,400
different statistical attacks it's not

799
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,890
that easy to filter for all around are

800
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,480
very few<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think so if there</font>

801
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,150
is filtering it's filtering the one

802
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:12,230
attack that pays off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most but</font>

803
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:15,530
alright so let's give this a shot tell

804
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:20,530
the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> size some debugging output is</font>

805
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,530
handy pass it a pcap file

806
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:27,069
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the week the hardest to crack</font>

807
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:28,569
pcap file that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've generated and it's</font>

808
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:30,099
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to crack it right</font>

809
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:34,210
come anywhere near cracking it but you

810
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:35,829
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works so if everybody's</font>

811
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,499
used aircrack before they probably

812
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:41,829
recognize what this looks like it's it's

813
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:44,709
a brute forcing a 13 bike key and you

814
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:46,569
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only see 11</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes up on the display</font>

815
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,789
the bottom two are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> root forced</font>

816
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:51,160
in real time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it takes this</font>

817
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:53,769
9f to slide over is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> takes to</font>

818
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">brute force 16 bits of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the key at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

819
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:59,109
bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> so uh basically the way this</font>

820
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,900
whole program works is reading all these

821
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:03,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">peak apps or packets compute some</font>

822
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,739
statistical functions over them and

823
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:08,559
generate weighted guesses on the value

824
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,999
for the key and all these weights are

825
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,390
pretty even and they're also pretty low

826
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:15,879
the key is 0 0 1 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 2 and you don't see</font>

827
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,319
0 1 1 2 2 in here so didn't do a very

828
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,259
good job it's just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough data</font>

829
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:24,239
available let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with an easier</font>

830
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,239
file jump up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

831
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:33,060
okay this looks a lot more promising 0 0

832
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,640
1 1 2 2 it's got a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of them you</font>

833
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,529
can see the weights are higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

834
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,759
one handy thing for this is if you're

835
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,340
actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop some sort of</font>

836
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,590
new attack these the display down here

837
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,870
showing the number of the pack the

838
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,040
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that attack week Ivy's</font>

839
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:49,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's found and the weight you've</font>

840
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,140
assigned to it so the classical attack

841
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:54,770
is a pack<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 it's found 687 of those and</font>

842
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,120
they get assigned to wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 this is a</font>

843
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:00,810
you know different attacks and this

844
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,520
one's got wait three so I that's useful

845
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,049
for trying to see you know if you're

846
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,120
trying to gather some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more intelligence</font>

847
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,680
on how these things work or I really

848
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,130
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see for example what happens if</font>

849
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,220
I'm only using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first attack you can</font>

850
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:16,140
specify the end so if you're wondering

851
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,060
maybe I should wait this one higher

852
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,770
let's see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it goes all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ones</font>

853
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,060
are have their weight set to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 and are</font>

854
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,950
displayed and red at the bottom so you

855
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,140
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I don't have any of</font>

856
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:28,859
those other attacks I didn't do nearly

857
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,319
as well I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 0 no 11 no 22 you know</font>

858
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:36,360
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fell out a little bit kind of</font>

859
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">handy can also do the inverse which is</font>

860
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,060
again useful if you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

861
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:43,230
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in how this stuff works so</font>

862
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way your hardware accelerate this</font>

863
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,530
thing is I've explained this to some

864
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,700
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go into it</font>

865
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,230
apparently a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think the</font>

866
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,240
thing to accelerate is the computation

867
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:53,490
of the statistics<font color="#CCCCCC"> and really you only do</font>

868
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,379
that 17 functions over each packet you

869
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,450
see it once so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much</font>

870
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,890
computation time<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the real problem</font>

871
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,540
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying their brute forcing the</font>

872
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:03,299
bottom of the key space so you can

873
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,820
change that and let's say now i'm going

874
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:08,910
to brute force one bite at the bottom

875
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you'll see the display updates a lot</font>

876
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:14,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">faster and there's only one bite you</font>

877
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:19,290
don't see similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can to his little</font>

878
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:21,330
fault so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i jump up to three it pretty</font>

879
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">much looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the program stopped it</font>

880
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,779
actually isn't stopped it's just

881
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:26,910
brute-forcing three bites at the bottom

882
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you're going to sit here for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

883
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,950
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even waited it out honestly so</font>

884
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an hour to what we'd like to do</font>

885
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,250
is get it so that you can brute force

886
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,260
three bites at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom with an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGA</font>

887
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,280
and this pays off better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

888
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,960
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

889
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">she the further you get from the top of</font>

890
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the key the harder it is to generate</font>

891
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,149
these statistics reliably so it's

892
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually better than not only in my</font>

893
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:49,620
brute forcing one more bite just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as fast</font>

894
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:54,660
I'm brute-forcing the three hardest

895
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:58,680
bites which is you know good so that's

896
00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:00,450
aircrack let's get back to my

897
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:05,190
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hope this doesn't crash</font>

898
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:08,399
again any questions on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before I</font>

899
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,700
delve into other tools you ask me later

900
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,700
to

901
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:27,740
okay so all right I didn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

902
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:30,680
screenshot it all worked out so JC JC

903
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,379
web crack is the just plain old key

904
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,779
brute forcer there's no no clever

905
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,970
statistics is just sitting at home for

906
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,920
cracking WEP keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually wrote this</font>

907
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,930
ah like three years ago and I use it

908
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,880
pretty effectively on a cluster and so

909
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,680
if you're curious if you want a brute

910
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">force in the entire 40 bit key you need</font>

911
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 24 hours with about 10 or 11</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> f on</font>

MP 1108 your disposal that's the worst

913
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:56,600
case so 12 hours on average which is

914
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,759
very handy it's also the only way to

915
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,980
know if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got 104 bit key really if</font>

916
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,290
you try all 40 bits of a lower one and

917
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:06,830
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I got to start</font>

918
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:09,590
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do stuff to 104 of it so JC</font>

919
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:10,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">web crack now has support for the pie co</font>

920
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:15,350
client which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to the</font>

921
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:16,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">FPGA so this is a picture of the JC web</font>

922
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,279
cracked server which is responsible for

923
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:22,160
handing out chunks of the key space that

924
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,300
clients now start it up later with fpga

925
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,259
so when I can get into it too much now

926
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,090
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it worked before you</font>

927
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,640
just start a tasty wet track<font color="#E5E5E5"> D on some</font>

928
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:34,370
server somewhere you get a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

929
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,859
clients to talk to the server and check

930
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:39,710
out key spaces how you obtain these

931
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,420
clients is up to you the client would

932
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,310
probably even compile and run on cygwin

933
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,400
though I've never bothered it all the

934
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:48,110
stuff runs on OS X and Linux and top

935
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,270
cross talks for each other so OS<font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font>

936
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:52,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linux boxes whatever all plays</font>

937
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:54,470
nice so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gotta get a bunch of</font>

938
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,180
client computers to do your work

939
00:44:54,470 --> 00:45:02,419
someone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're gonna be the JC web</font>

940
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:04,279
crack worm no comment so this this is

941
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,020
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean people kind of think why</font>

942
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,180
would you brute force a 40-bit key and

943
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,980
I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a head Hannah</font>

944
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">clustering now I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fpgas I had a</font>

945
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,060
cluster so it was really nice for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

946
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:17,960
know 24 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas case turn your key</font>

947
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:20,640
around so to accelerate it now we just

948
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">bring in the pie co client into the pic</font>

949
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,490
you know so we've got our normal client

950
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,079
sitting there and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the server</font>

951
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,430
check nike spaces and then we bring this

952
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:28,410
one guy who's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> smarter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and he</font>

953
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:33,649
talks to fpga and fpga does all the work

954
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,649
for him so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> can intermix them as well</font>

955
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,509
currently the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is that JC</font>

956
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,980
wet crack teen talks to the pike<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oakland</font>

957
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,819
the Pikeville client talks straight to

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FPGA Lucy aircrack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plain get my</font>

959
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:50,460
mouse over here yeah JC aircrack doesn't

960
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:52,500
have any hardware support yet which you

961
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I'd like to get in there but I was</font>

962
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,730
not going to hack it in too fast like a

963
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,349
kit<font color="#CCCCCC"> into you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client and then</font>

964
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,890
hack it into JC aircrack but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:03,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do this which is</font>

966
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:05,670
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to throw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:08,819
hardware support I can inside air where

968
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:11,279
so all the programs suddenly crack stuff

969
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:13,230
as fast as they can on that platform if

970
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:14,609
anybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever seen core image on OSX</font>

971
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,019
that's pretty much the motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

972
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:19,470
this it's really slick you give it a

973
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:20,939
little program to do manipulations of

974
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,578
graphics and it'll either run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

975
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">GPU or run it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cpu in parallel as</font>

976
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:27,059
fast as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the client go doesn't</font>

977
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:29,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to deal with it well I'm trying to</font>

978
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:30,690
do the same thing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll probably end</font>

979
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:32,220
up writing some other cracking tool at

980
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,769
some point in the future and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

981
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:37,078
not have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewrite all the code to the</font>

982
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:39,450
hawk to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGA so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font>

983
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,190
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the near future hopefully is that air</font>

984
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:45,118
where is going to have all this code

985
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:48,150
that will talk to hardware right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we</font>

986
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">got fpga code and you know software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

987
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,690
there's other things you could try to do

988
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:52,859
this on GP user you know something

989
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,740
people have toyed with and there's

990
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:57,450
compilers to target them that cool

991
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,709
physics engine thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

992
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,009
the hell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to that but that's</font>

993
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:04,410
another idea and so then all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font>

994
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:06,000
code you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sort of simple JC web</font>

995
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,440
crack client no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it keep</font>

996
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
track of the fastest way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything</font>

997
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just calls earlier an area where</font>

998
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,730
figures it out and as soon as I do that

999
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,049
JC aircrack will immediately be

1000
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:21,000
optimized which is nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's going</font>

1001
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen shortly i hope so this is a</font>

1002
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,950
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of details on how we actually</font>

1003
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:27,869
talked to the card right now basically

1004
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,879
the pike old client gets a key from the

1005
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:31,140
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> room it's like okay figure out</font>

1006
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I'm supposed to do and it tells</font>

1007
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,480
fpga

1008
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:38,470
where to start at where to stop at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1009
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,930
size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the key and the hopeful prva the</font>

1010
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:42,790
way this is implemented is that we we

1011
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,649
know the first six bytes of the random

1012
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:46,870
output from<font color="#CCCCCC"> RC four because they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1013
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,480
they snap header of every packet so we

1014
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:52,299
can extra out six<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes of every packet</font>

1015
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,330
and get the output from RC<font color="#E5E5E5"> four so like</font>

1016
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,220
okay then we just tell fpga do all these

1017
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:59,680
keys and if you've seen one that outputs

1018
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,839
these six bytes we've probably got the

1019
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,190
key there could be collisions I mean

1020
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,960
it's only six bytes it's pretty unlikely

1021
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,360
so then the software actually has to

1022
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,530
kick in<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hardware says it's this the</font>

1023
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,970
software is going to double check and

1024
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:15,490
make sure it works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know</font>

1025
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:17,290
it's like okay we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key so that's</font>

1026
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,520
just everything I have an air base so

1027
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:21,670
now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to do a demo</font>

1028
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,950
right hope for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best oh don't know</font>

1029
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,750
the oh that stuff yeah oh I got some

1030
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:29,259
slides outside I can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over that real</font>

1031
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:35,890
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can do the demo yeah</font>

1032
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:37,450
that's how I didn't crash again okay you

1033
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,520
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of already explained some</font>

1034
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:43,060
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpga stuff but I've got some some</font>

1035
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,360
diagrams here that might illustrate a

1036
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,360
little bit

1037
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,270
Oh

1038
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:18,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so right now on fpga we've got 16</font>

1039
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,850
RC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 cores that we built uses block ram</font>

1040
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:22,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">4s boxes so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the main</font>

1041
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,200
problem with running<font color="#CCCCCC"> rc4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and hardware is</font>

1042
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,580
that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this S box that you know</font>

1043
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,259
it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> great in software because it's</font>

1044
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:32,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">just Ram but when you're dealing with</font>

1045
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">like 256 8-bit registers it takes up a</font>

1046
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,060
lot of space and so with block Graham

1047
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,410
it's kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> little tiny Rams that</font>

1048
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost kind of like cash on your</font>

1049
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:42,509
processor so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really fast to access</font>

1050
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:45,480
and so we we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use those</font>

1051
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:46,860
for for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this boxes and yeah it just</font>

1052
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:51,630
tries every key between the start and

1053
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:54,420
the end so if you've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> rc4 before</font>

1054
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,710
it's a really simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm you</font>

1055
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just have this initialization</font>

1056
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:01,890
step where you set your<font color="#E5E5E5"> S box to just</font>

1057
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:05,430
like a permutation from like basically

1058
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:07,740
zero through 255 inside this buffer and

1059
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:10,410
then you kind of do a bunch of mixing

1060
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the KSA and then for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prg a you</font>

1061
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:15,089
do some more mixing and like pull out

1062
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,560
values here and there so it's a it's an

1063
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,210
extremely simple algorithm and software

1064
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,130
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pretty simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1065
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:24,180
hardware but you just have to pull some

1066
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:26,580
different tricks and stuff basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1067
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,049
an RC<font color="#E5E5E5"> for module you have you just look</font>

1068
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">at your inputs in your outputs and you</font>

1069
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:31,650
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tailor something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around that</font>

1070
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,810
where you get a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> input and you</font>

1071
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:35,520
know gives you the right output so for

1072
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:37,890
this particular module basically your

1073
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,580
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your input and your PR GA is</font>

1074
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:44,549
going to be the output and what one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1075
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:46,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems here yeah and this is</font>

1076
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:49,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically how it cracks it you have like</font>

1077
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,530
some sort of expected PR GA and it sends

1078
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:55,500
out like key 0 key one key to and then

1079
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:57,090
it gets back some sort of PR<font color="#E5E5E5"> GA and this</font>

1080
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,670
is this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is normally supposed to</font>

1081
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,740
be like hex values but just for like

1082
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:06,150
artistic value here through those in and

1083
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:08,040
so it keeps on going along<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and then</font>

1084
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:10,530
you know finally oh yeah there's bling

1085
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah I got some bling you got some</font>

1086
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:14,490
bling yeah we're real good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so then</font>

1087
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,558
it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that must be the key and</font>

1088
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:19,390
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just reports it back</font>

1089
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">what issue with this is that you end up</font>

1090
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:24,098
wasting lots of cycles just initializing

1091
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:25,359
this s<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox value here and so essentially</font>

1092
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:27,490
there's like two hundred fifty six

1093
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,640
cycles to initialize this then I was

1094
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:34,269
another 256 maybe 512 to do this whole

1095
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,859
step and then an additional like 8 16 or

1096
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:37,180
something like that to do that step just

1097
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:39,490
because there's so many iterations that

1098
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:41,529
are dependent<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the previous ones with</font>

1099
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:44,250
this initialization step you can

1100
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:47,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do that kind of in parallel and</font>

1101
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:49,720
how we do this is we have our initial s

1102
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:53,079
box that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the computer writes</font>

1103
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:55,328
the values to and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have the</font>

1104
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,190
S box write it out to these different

1105
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:59,680
block grabs that are associated with

1106
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:02,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">these different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rc4 course and then</font>

1107
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:05,410
after those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> filled then the rc4 cord</font>

1108
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:07,269
uses that s box and we'll end up you

1109
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:09,038
know writing values into it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll do</font>

1110
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:11,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">all sorts of like mixing and stuff and</font>

1111
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,000
meanwhile while it's doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we fill</font>

1112
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,259
up these other block<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rams and so we're</font>

1113
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,319
actually doing the initialization step

1114
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:19,779
for the next rc4 run in like the

1115
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:22,210
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and so then after it's done</font>

1116
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:24,519
with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> rc4 step it moves on it uses</font>

1117
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:27,130
this one you know police that one then

1118
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:28,569
yeah switches back and forth and so that

1119
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,619
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like one optimization</font>

1120
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:34,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we came up with for doing this</font>

1121
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:38,500
whole thing so now here comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demo</font>

1122
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:43,200
basically JC web crack +<font color="#E5E5E5"> FPGA plus the</font>

1123
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,200
matrix crashing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Feeny's</font>

1124
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:14,430
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> also my cert the card the</font>

1125
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:15,990
right way<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> startup so</font>

1126
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,879
just starting up they see web crack be

1127
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:21,058
the same old server we've had for quite

1128
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,380
a while so got the pretty cursus

1129
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:25,519
interface if you haven't figured out<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1130
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:28,230
like curses and I've also clearly had a

1131
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:30,990
turbo<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pascal influence my interface</font>

1132
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:34,559
design since I was a child just can't

1133
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:36,209
kick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see it's got a</font>

1134
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,009
chunk size you can tell how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits a</font>

1135
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,990
client wants to check out or how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

1136
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:41,549
are out and how long to wait until you

1137
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:46,859
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all that chunks not going</font>

1138
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:50,730
back so let's start up a client cross my

1139
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:53,308
fingers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's reading the keys</font>

1140
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">off the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FPGA right now in real time and</font>

1141
00:53:53,309 --> 00:54:04,470
it can redraw the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> this quickly</font>

1142
00:53:54,779 --> 00:54:06,059
because yeah thank you so the real

1143
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:07,410
beauty of this is I've showed<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1144
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:09,630
people they're like John you're wasting

1145
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,940
CPU cycles drawing the screen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1146
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:14,640
I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm not I'm doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

1147
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,309
on the card there is no you know the cpu

1148
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,529
usage right now is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero percent so</font>

1149
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:21,089
you can sit here and draw whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1150
00:54:19,529 --> 00:54:22,920
want as quickly as often as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

1151
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:26,099
like and you end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something as</font>

1152
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,680
pretty as this um I think Nikki I

1153
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:33,509
started to that was 0004 so it'll get

1154
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:35,899
there in like a minute or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so ok let's</font>

1155
00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:35,900
see a top

1156
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:46,110
oh we got to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the finished all right</font>

1157
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:49,710
we'll make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here we go ah so cpu</font>

1158
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:51,510
usage 0%<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so you could just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

1159
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:53,940
up another you know JC<font color="#E5E5E5"> web cracked</font>

1160
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:58,590
cpu-bound 12 and do twice as fast but

1161
00:54:53,940 --> 00:55:04,980
let's go watch this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so gross her</font>

1162
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:21,740
fingers yeah he starts his you 004 there

1163
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:31,140
is no spoon oh the suspense there we go

1164
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:33,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">hahaha thank you you would not believe</font>

1165
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">how many nights I spent sending riot</font>

1166
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,020
terminal codes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1167
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:45,029
right because i didn't use curses cuz

1168
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm just old school</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hahahaha that's the</font>

1169
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:50,460
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> release oh there is one more thing</font>

1170
00:55:48,359 --> 00:56:03,619
you can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the color as well for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1171
00:55:50,460 --> 00:56:03,619
matrix purists got to start the seer

1172
00:56:06,259 --> 00:56:10,829
huh so don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me how I did the matrix</font>

1173
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,240
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I won't tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you because I</font>

1174
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:14,069
showed some of this like dude that's

1175
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,508
awesome like yeah how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it and I</font>

1176
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:28,640
told them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like that's way</font>

1177
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:31,170
less cool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a secret oh right okay</font>

1178
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:37,558
can't change<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the fly yet that's a</font>

1179
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:40,499
future feature there you go so any

1180
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:45,990
questions on anything I guess we're done

1181
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:48,558
with the rest of the presentation 42

1182
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,558
next

1183
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:07,960
did you actually what I mean is this

1184
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:09,609
using the previous code I wrote yeah

1185
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,319
yeah this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to the same server</font>

1186
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:15,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been using for a couple of</font>

1187
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:17,019
years ago yeah the first distributed web

1188
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">crack version yeah this is still even</font>

1189
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:22,569
using the same protocol so still still

1190
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:25,990
the same server still the same protocol

1191
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:36,849
the interoperates technique so any other

1192
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:42,160
questions if you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really lucky</font>

1193
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:44,019
but yeah packet injection helps the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air</font>

1194
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">crack hasn't been accelerated yet or</font>

1195
00:57:44,019 --> 00:57:47,649
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get this this code</font>

1196
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:49,450
merchant the area where and then

1197
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:52,059
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be accelerated but yeah</font>

1198
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:54,069
it would it would help a lot there's no

1199
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:55,990
bus packets and stuff yeah still the

1200
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is there's a huge trade off</font>

1201
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:59,740
between like a hundred more packets and

1202
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,180
like an hour more CPU time you would

1203
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,038
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather have a hundred more week</font>

1204
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:05,950
packets and another you know gigahertz

1205
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:13,170
probably so more data helps more than

1206
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:13,169
more CPU cycles anyone else

1207
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:25,080
hard to see with the lights all right

1208
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:26,460
sure hmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess at the end or we can</font>

1209
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:39,029
try and figure out who asked questions

1210
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:43,520
before earlier yeah yes yes they are how

1211
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:46,110
much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys got yes that's me profit I</font>

1212
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,960
don't know I think that I think he can

1213
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,670
burn<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven dvds at a time and probably</font>

1214
00:58:48,960 --> 00:59:08,280
has a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of extra DVDs laying around</font>

1215
00:58:50,670 --> 00:59:10,320
yeah so oh yeah there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a see huh oh hey</font>

1216
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:13,620
slides yeah there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides</font>

1217
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:15,690
but yeah whatever yeah well no we got

1218
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,130
four four summers on some yeah yeah we

1219
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:19,890
actually computed some yeah its

1220
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:24,450
performance stuff so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

1221
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:25,980
performance and yeah I'm one of these

1222
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">cards in here we're getting about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1223
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,220
million per second we can probably

1224
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:32,490
crease that to like three or four if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1225
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimize stuff some more that's a bit</font>

1226
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:41,189
faster so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can weaken like brute</font>

1227
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:45,770
force 24 bits really fast instead of two

1228
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:51,510
bits they're 16 bits or whatever or one

1229
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:54,119
what's up so conclusions get an FPGA and

1230
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:57,390
start cracking make use of your hardware

1231
00:59:54,119 --> 01:00:02,220
to break crypto add cool matrix ascii

1232
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:04,950
effects when you can choose bed please

1233
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:07,649
please or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 bit password be anything</font>

1234
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:09,000
you want then and so yeah now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1235
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:11,430
we're going to do questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

1236
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,810
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool questions before</font>

1237
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:15,330
just ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> them again and we'll get nice</font>

1238
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:17,670
and stuff or something but um yeah so

1239
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:25,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">any questions even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've already</font>

1240
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:29,430
probably gone through much<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay why</font>

1241
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:35,850
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come up and get some DVDs I'm</font>

1242
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:41,580
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer it yeah did you yes</font>

1243
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:45,060
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions right yeah one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1244
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:47,580
them um like I'm one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cores or one</font>

1245
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:51,630
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cards one of the cards um three</font>

1246
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:54,509
yeah yeah one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these elex 25s is</font>

1247
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:58,200
equivalent to supposedly like one and a

1248
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:59,670
half million gates roughly so yeah they

1249
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,560
they've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of switched away from the</font>

1250
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:03,450
whole gate concept to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots or</font>

1251
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:06,140
slices and so they're they're using

1252
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:12,660
totally different metrics for everything

1253
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:19,080
yeah you have to take all three yeah

1254
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:25,790
there's 90 VDS total yeah so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1255
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:25,790
take a stack of three oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1256
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:40,260
yeah yeah it definitely would be we're

1257
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">just uh yeah yeah yeah exactly like yeah</font>

1258
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:43,560
we didn't have like tons of budget to

1259
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,420
have a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different projects going</font>

1260
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,009
on at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time so right now we've</font>

1261
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:49,230
just got this compact flash one we've

1262
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:51,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a card bus-based one and we're going</font>

1263
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:53,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have an expresscard one pretty soon</font>

1264
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:56,640
and pretty much all those you can adapt

1265
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:58,890
to like pci or pci express or whatever

1266
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,480
so that's good enough for now we'll

1267
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:02,129
probably do a board like that later but

1268
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:09,840
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you can find lots of</font>

1269
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:13,200
pci boards out there so oh yeah yeah

1270
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,430
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

1271
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,710
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing something like that</font>

1272
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:22,759
but there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> other places out</font>

1273
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:27,750
there that do stuff like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay uh</font>

1274
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:29,490
I don't know actually I almost forgot i

1275
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:33,410
got some guinness up here so you get a

1276
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:36,479
beer anybody else have a good question

1277
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:50,670
needle you want to get us<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here you</font>

1278
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:51,990
go do I get one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I did oh yeah</font>

1279
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:54,360
Spartan<font color="#E5E5E5"> threes are really cheap you can</font>

1280
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:56,430
just go into xilinx calm and search

1281
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">there they have a directory of all their</font>

1282
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:01,140
different dev boards and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

1283
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,810
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a starter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spartan 3 with like I</font>

1284
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,930
don't know 500,000 gates for like a

1285
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:11,370
hundred bucks or like one with like a

1286
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:13,020
million gates for what's um like a

1287
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:15,870
million gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> one would be maybe be about</font>

1288
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:18,240
like half half as fast as this you could

1289
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:20,250
probably get maybe like like a two or

1290
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,220
three million gate sort of range<font color="#CCCCCC"> 14</font>

1291
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:24,090
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be about equivalent to this</font>

1292
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,709
for maybe about three or four hundred

1293
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:28,410
bucks like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this part in threes and</font>

1294
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:29,010
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same for vertex 4 if you got</font>

1295
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:38,160
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

1296
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:40,770
if your student like an engineering you

1297
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:47,910
want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a beer or you want some</font>

1298
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:51,300
tables<font color="#E5E5E5"> no there's an or there ya got to</font>

1299
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:59,190
know your priorities tables review yeah

1300
01:03:51,300 --> 01:04:05,580
sure when I ok ok like say at home yeah

1301
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:16,020
um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't maybe a speed all about</font>

1302
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:23,370

blinkies IM you doing if you're doing

1308
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:51,000
like some sort of yeah it doesn't look

1309
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:56,700
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah yeah um yeah so yeah what</font>

1310
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,920
was the question again yeah you can you

1311
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:00,210
can buy one of these from us right now

1312
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,470
if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is like some cool</font>

1313
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:03,540
projects with it we can give you a good

1314
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:05,970
discount unlike<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cards and stuff so</font>

1315
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:08,940
just uh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just give me a call or</font>

1316
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:11,270
send me an email or something any other

1317
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,270
questions

1318
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:35,119
ya know it's kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing I</font>

1319
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,800
mean yeah I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would probably a</font>

1320
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,569
little more efficient to compare like a

1321
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,940
smaller counter than like a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font>

1322
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:43,130
but I'm really really incrementing by

1323
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:46,190
like a maximum 32 bits or something like

1324
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:47,900
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I know it's yet it's not too</font>

1325
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:49,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad like on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PGA the difference</font>

1326
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,869
between guys there's there's a lot of

1327
01:05:49,369 --> 01:05:52,869
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff on there they're slower so</font>

1328
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,979
yeah so I think you get a beer and petty

1329
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:00,200
gets beer and any other questions I

1330
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:05,390
think we're all out of beer so I don't

1331
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:14,859
blame you if we yeah okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright thanks</font>

1332
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:14,859
a lot guys by the way
