4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,750

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,519
to state throughout the presentation

12
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,658
real quickly show of hands how many here

13
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,039
actually made it to shmoocon this year

14
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:08,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so there's five or six of you</font>

15
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:10,430
that will spot me for not having changed

16
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:12,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation significantly since</font>

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mook on hopefully you'll let that slide</font>

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,300
there have been a couple of changes and

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,610
I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of other announcements so</font>

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,800
with that I will kick this off again my

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Taylor banks I am also known to</font>

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,190
some as dr. chaos of chaos theory and I

23
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:31,429
am here today to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I'm not mos</font>

24
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:33,679
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one needs to know so first</font>

25
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:36,080
and foremost<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are we chaos theory we</font>

26
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:39,590
are a loose-knit group of security

professionals hackers artists general

28
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,869
lunatics and I could probably continue

29
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:46,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">to add entries to that category</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:48,530
scattered across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the planet though</font>

31
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,378
several of us live in Atlanta we have

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,289
members all across this continent and

33
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:56,479
also throughout Europe and we are here

34
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:58,039
today to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> anônimo s now I</font>

35
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually I intended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring a couple of</font>

36
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,250
other folks with me they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

37
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,500
here for the presentation although

38
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,090
hopefully if all goes well on my

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,160
secondary laptop we will be bringing

40
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,369
them in via Skype towards the end of

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,720
this presentation so and on MOS this is

42
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,510
what we're here to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,220
our latest release<font color="#CCCCCC"> an autumn OS being an</font>

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,200
for us and this was a big motivation in

46
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,910
getting this to a release ready state

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,560
prior to shmoocon we've made some

48
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,410
changes since and i'll be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,599
those a little bit later on<font color="#CCCCCC"> anónimo wes</font>

50
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,260
is a secure environment designed to be

that are intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be secure and</font>

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,060
on MOS should be easy

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,300
for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mum to use of course assuming</font>

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:53,120
she has something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hide so what</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide that functionality we have</font>

66
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,640
a very different goal in mind so without

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,190
further ado why did we build an autumn

68
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,010
OS well we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> several motivations and</font>

69
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,630
again knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that members in our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

70
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,709

<font color="#E5E5E5">and work for several different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">environment is a hostile environment</font>

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,480
what with spam and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisher's adware</font>

75
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,310
malware spyware and the insecure

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,679
environment that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate in our</font>

77
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,930
operating systems our applications are

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,480
networks even our protocols are

79
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,910
inherently insecure so this poses a

80
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,549
problem how do i maintain security how

81
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,989
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remain private and anonymous while</font>

I'm on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet I don't want</font>

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,290
everybody in this room to know what I'm

84
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,110
doing when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm out browsing around</font>

85
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,000
whether I'm browsing corporate websites

86
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,130
and researching a company for which I'm

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing a penetration test for whether I'm</font>

browsing granny tranny porn it doesn't

89
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,000
matter it's none of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,950
there's also heightened monitoring by

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,630
governments and corporate interests and

92
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,190
we know this and what with Patriot Act

93
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,470
it's getting scary the operating

94
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,180
environment is it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> delicate now</font>

95
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,988
and you never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's being</font>

96
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,180
tracked<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is</font>

97
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:26,030
also a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where people intend to</font>

communicate create buy and sell trade

collaborate work and play so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

100
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,740
reconcile these how do we reconcile this

101
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,050
hostile dangerous environment that is

102
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,940
the internet with hey I got a whole

103
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of things that I want to do and I</font>

104
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,810
don't want have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about who's</font>

105
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,760
watching me do it speaking of work we

106
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,260
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> screenshot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and it's probably</font>

107
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,390
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hard to see especially for the</font>

108
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,010
folks in the back but I'll give you an

109
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,510
idea of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is while one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,240
members<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our group was doing research</font>

111
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:56,150
for this presentation in an effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

112
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,010
to the tour website to pull up some text

00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,609
for this presentation his corporate

filtered access to the tour website

116
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,669
access to this requested website is

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,259
prohibited so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another important</font>

118
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason for the existence of anônimo</font>

119
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">West because in a lot of cases we don't</font>

120
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,379
want to be limited by the decisions

121
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,069
others are making<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

122
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:17,689
and should not see more networks the

123
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:20,930
proliferation a very convenient but

124
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:22,159
dubiously secured networks as we we've

125
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,689
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of different</font>

126
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:26,210
contexts including this morning from

127
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:28,129
Ken's talk there are a wide variety of

128
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,590
open access points and wireless access

129
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,750
points internet cafes there are

130
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,128
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon thousands upon thousands</font>

131
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,250
of places<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can connect to the</font>

00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:39,199
internet free easy unfortunately again

133
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,639
these are dubiously secured networks so

134
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,319
we have more to worry about there than

135
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,550
anywhere else you have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

136
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,409
somebody's doing in the network that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

had to be worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about privacy and this</font>

143
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,759
is really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis for why we built our</font>

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">anônimo s was not to require someone to</font>

183
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,169

00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:33,620
setting up and configuring tour and

but we had no concept of actually doing

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,990
it so I set out and build a presentation

203
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,789

are going to ultimately be mitigated or

211
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,838

I don't stand out in scans and if at all

again we use anonymizing proxies there

291
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,258
are a couple of reasons why initially

292
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,870
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical reason for this</font>

293
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,759
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heart of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's defense in</font>

00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,640
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design goal</font>

297
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,010
here again is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is</font>

314
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,630
not only with CLI tools but we needed to

315

provide a GUI that was as<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to a</font>

effort initially to modify<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP stack</font>

365

chosen to modify stack behaviors and

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,780
look like nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> else look like some</font>

unknown system that is not easily

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,089
identifiable by our fingerprints by our

370
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,100
doing so makes it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as glaringly</font>

371
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,839
obvious as if we stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the original</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">openbsd fingerprints if somebody is out</font>

373
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,920
scanning the network at my local coffee

374
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,200
shop and they get 15 windows boxes in an

375
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,969
unknown box guess which box they're

376
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,360
going to continue to investigate the

377
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,130
unknown box so again we aimed to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

378
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,790
our behavior look as much like Windows

379
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,560
XP service pack 1 as possible and we

380
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,510
extended this into the client software

381
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,849
as well we modified standard browser

382
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,160
behaviors so that the browser we're

383
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,830
using inside of a non<font color="#CCCCCC"> MOS looks more</font>

384
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">like ie or maybe Firefox running on</font>

385
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows XP then the browser that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

386
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,400
actually utilizing and the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

387
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,710
we're using from here<font color="#E5E5E5"> again I talked</font>

388
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,240
ingress and egress filtering both are

389
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,530
very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case of the system</font>

390
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,230
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be both to secure an</font>

391
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:21,350
anonymous so all incoming and outgoing

392
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:24,110
packets by default are managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by PF and</font>

393
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,030
we are essentially blocking all inbound

394
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,280
traffic there are no open ports on the

395
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,780
box there are no listening services but

396
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,260
more importantly we're also blocking

397
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:35,660
most outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic the goal here was</font>

398
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,460
to eliminate unencrypted or

399
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,819
non-anonymous traffic to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest</font>

400
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,440
degree possible so what we did we

401
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,210
basically narrowed down the list of

402
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">ports that are used by tour for our</font>

403
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,270
outbound connections and there are a

404
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,550
couple of ports<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that are used by</font>

405
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,910
the tour directory service servers as

406
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">well as the tour servers themselves</font>

407
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,089
unfortunately and again the topic of

408
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,830
much debate we went all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to wire</font>

409
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:01,370
with this we did not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow</font>

410
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,259
outbound port 8443 was ok but port 80 we

411
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">Center</font>

412
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:07,600
stay on port 80<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's unencrypted and you</font>

413
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,189
know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> is eventually going to go</font>

414
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,290
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and accidentally change the proxy</font>

415
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:12,699
settings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox and bam they're</font>

416
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,169
going to bypass everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

417
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,660
worked hard to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together inside of a</font>

418
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:18,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">not mos the problem was when we</font>

419
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,199
investigated<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a little bit further</font>

420
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,879
we yanked 80 out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our packet filter</font>

421
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:23,738
and we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to push the box</font>

422
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,089
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a sudden our demos broke and</font>

423
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:27,459
we couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out anywhere we couldn't</font>

424
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:30,220
do anything well as it turns out there

425
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:32,709
are essentially three toward directory

426
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:35,199
servers that are tour sanctioned or tour

427
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:37,449
official directory servers two of them

428
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,029
run on port 80 the third one runs on an

429
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,679
alternate port and it's down so we were

430
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,389

431
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:47,799
unfortunately we are going to have to

432
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:49,179
use port 8443 not really a bad thing in

433
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sense that again I walk into a</font>

its first iteration in a non m OS

00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:07,089
version 0 you as we dubbed it there's no

441
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:09,549
real control to ensure that outbound

442
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,438
traffic is actually managed by tour we

443
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:12,609
just use PF and said hey all right these

444
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,949
are the only ports we're going to allow

445
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">out now in the second version which is</font>

447
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,039
made some changes so that those ports

00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,860
are allowed outbound but only<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

450
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,128

00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:29,110
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> only tour and other</font>

456
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,570
here's what we did and what we

457
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,189
standardized on we went<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and kind</font>

465
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,200
it is lightweight one of the things

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think in a later slide is</font>

467
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,600
that openbsd is by no means optimized

468
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:06,460
for live CD execution is designed to be

469

that reason there are some performance

00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,740
issues that we see with

473
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,419
openbsd that we haven't yet been able to

474

eliminate entirely we've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

477
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,630
as a live CD we went with Firefox as a

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,950
browser again standards here something

479
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,990
everybody's familiar with and with

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,970
Firefox 106 vs 1 dot 5x an important

483
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,918
thing to point out here and again this

484
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,350
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll touch on later almost</font>

improve and update a non MOS as new

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:01,549
iterations of openbsd came out the

493
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">easiest thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do was to standardize</font>

on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> openbsd ports tree thus</font>

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,010
everything is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an update and we're</font>

496
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,990
not rebuilding everything from scratch

497
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:13,129
every time we decide to spin out a new

498
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:15,820
version of an animal s second thing here

499
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:18,020
was easing building we had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

500
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,210
questions and feedback from folks who

said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hey I grabbed the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISO when</font>

502
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,230
you guys released it and how do i really

503
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,909
know this is an animal s how do i how do

504
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">I trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it how do I trust the binaries</font>

505
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,330
you're using how do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the the</font>

506
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,100
pieces and components that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">installed in the operating system the</font>

508
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,510
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer was if its imports it's easy</font>

509
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,669
for you to replicate the system from

510
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,799
scratch from source on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own drive</font>

511
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,120
and not have to worry about what we

512
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:44,059
might or might not have done with our

513
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,280
code so i will tell you we have not done

514
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,918
anything except utilize openbsd as a

515
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,658
base OS we have used all of these

516
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,059
binaries straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ports tree</font>

517
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:55,190
we've added a few scripts and a little

518
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,230
bit of back-end foo in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make all</font>

519
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,760
this stuff glue together and automate

520
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,950
the boot up process so that somebody

521
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,390
that is not familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with openbsd can</font>

522
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,299
still set up their network card and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

523
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:08,330
an IP command line side we've got links

524
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:10,280
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> mud gpg ssh to them again</font>

525
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're trying to go for kind of common</font>

526
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,610
applications that would give you basic

527
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:18,470
internet connectivity essential

528
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,939
functionality for webmail chat etc all

529
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,549
right this brings us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide on</font>

530
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Onion Routing now another show of hands</font>

531
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:25,330
here how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room are familiar</font>

as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process awesome that's most of the</font>

534
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,679
people in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the greatly over</font>

535
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,620
simplified explanation that goes along

536
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this slide is Onion Routing works</font>

537
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,090
much like<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymous remailers world</font>

538
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,129
essentially it is a series of encrypted

539
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,750
envelopes or in the case of Onion

540
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,760
Routing and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the concept</font>

541
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,610
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much like an onion there are</font>

542
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,620
layers upon layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of packets what we're</font>

543
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,740
doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're taking our traffic and we</font>

544
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,360
are encrypting it to the last possible

545
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,190
destination from there we take that

546
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,409
packet and encrypt it to the previous

547
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,750
destination in our chain all the way

548
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,940
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the first entry point which is</font>

549
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,550
the last or outer layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our encrypted</font>

550
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,080
packet that's what happens is as we send

551
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,810
our packets through this onion routing

552
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,820
Network essentially each node is only

553
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,550
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to remove the outer</font>

554
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,409
layer and further at the very best each

555
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,750
node is only going to know about the

556
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,120
previous and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> node after it it</font>

557
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,580
should never know both the start point

558
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the end point in an onion routed</font>

559
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,780
environment now the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

560
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,190
diagram that dingledine pointed out when

561
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,750
we were talking ish mu is that

562
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,850
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is somewhat</font>

563
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,860
inaccurate because in new versions of

564
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,959
tour and new versions of the code the

565
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,360
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> onion routes is now hard set</font>

566
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,100
at three so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be an</font>

567
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,199
instance where you are routing through

568
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,179
12 15 different onion routed nodes

569
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,560
unless of course you go in and make

570
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,010
modifications to the source before

571
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:53,649
building so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> tor kind of in a</font>

572
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:57,910
nutshell actually let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me jump back one</font>

573
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:59,260
thing I do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say about tore up one</font>

574
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,500
thing I do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say about tor is that</font>

575
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,970
in this case we use tor 1 or 0 1 0 dot

576
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,940
14 which again was straight from the

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">openbsd ports tree in our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next iteration</font>

578
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,960
of a non MOS again on our forthcoming

579
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,910
release we have actually opted to use an

580
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,640
alpha version of tour that is not an

581
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,320
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> bsd ports this was motivated</font>

582
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,550
primarily by dingledine and the tour

583
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,320

584
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately after our presentation at</font>

587

588
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,490
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> help performance a lot if you</font>

591
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,090
that's what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> tor is one of the</font>

only tools in the non<font color="#CCCCCC"> MOS we are</font>

593
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,800
actually tracking alpha versions rather

594
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,590
than tracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> openbsd ports but it is</font>

595

the exception not the rule from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:50,139
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a local proxy now there was</font>

597
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,659
originally logic and using local proxy

598
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,700
because of bugs in client applications

599
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,130
for instance despite the fact that

600
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Firefox has native Sox support</font>

601
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,530
unfortunately Firefox had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DNS leak</font>

602
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,040
such that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you made a request even</font>

603
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,629
though your HTTP or HTTPS traffic would

604
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,180
pass across the tour onion routing

605
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,500
Network unfortunately your DNS requests

606
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,330
were direct they would shoot straight

607
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
out to the DNS servers and even if

608
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,870
somebody couldn't see you browsing

609

613
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:29,770
order to fix that leak the reason being

614
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:33,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">that privoxy probe oxy works as an HTTP</font>

619
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,720
you can use the native socks proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

620
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,370
not have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS being leaked</font>

621
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,040
this is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> something we're using to</font>

622
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,870
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> our anonymity by blocking things</font>

623
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,820
like user agents coming from the browser

624
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,610
refers from the sites that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

625
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,520
browsing and again client OS types and

626
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,590
variables so we utilize privoxy in this

627
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,590
instance to again change our browser

628

signatures so that instead our client OS

629
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,030

windows xp service pack 1 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font>

632
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:18,090
we had this set using Firefox<font color="#E5E5E5"> one dot</font>

633
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:20,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">five was our attempted masquerade</font>

634
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:24,159
something we've determined after the

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,620
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay into sac our attempts at TCP</font>

636
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,720
fingerprinting evasion worked well but

637
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,159
not well enough we actually missed the

638
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,410
mark a little bit on looking exactly

639
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,900
like an XP service pack one box at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

640
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,370
stack level so now you have something

641
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like Windows</font>

642
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,909
depending on which tool you're using and

643
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,680
kind of like unknown if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

644
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,680
other tool question

645
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">should unless I'm incorrect it should</font>

646
00:24:53,059 --> 00:25:04,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm certainly willing to be</font>

647
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:09,140
corrected but it's a very possible cuz I

648
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:11,090
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we don't have yeah I</font>

649
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,520
we're not we're not dropping you know

650
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,530
certs into provide see in order for it

651
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,850
to essentially perform<font color="#CCCCCC"> then in the</font>

652
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,470
middle so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you're right in this</font>

653
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,110
case it probably is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel connection</font>

654
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,299
and so therefore yes I guess as HTTPS

655
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,949
then those those values are not masked

656
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:26,990
to be honest this was something that we

657
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,850
considered to be kind of a minor again

658
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,919
more of a defense-in-depth thing because

659
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,110
ultimately if you can't tell where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

660
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from or who I am which browser</font>

661
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:38,209
I'm using should be less relevant but

662
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:44,360
excellent point and something I'll have

663
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:46,400
to update into my slides the user agent

664
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,840
I don't know if there's one for I would

665
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,980
imagine there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one for client</font>

666
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> west type as well I know there's a</font>

667
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:56,179
user agent switcher for Firefox<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font>

668
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:58,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">right cool thank you you'll be the first</font>

669
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,630
to receive to AG at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our at</font>

670
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,610
the end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> session here so</font>

671
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,200
from here again<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to encrypted</font>

672
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,360
protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned that it would be</font>

673
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,610
important to use encrypted protocols

674
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,990
again the reason being if you are using

675
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,520
unencrypted protocols you're not

676
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,770
anonymous I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care which onion</font>

677
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,168
routing Network you're using therefore

678
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,970
most in fact all of the clients that

679
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:19,340
we've implemented in on MOS they

680
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,020
natively support both socks proxy but

681
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,770
they also support secure protocols

682
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:30,049
themselves https<font color="#E5E5E5"> imap as pop best secure</font>

683
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:32,840
smtp etc etc d<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sox then pushes non socks</font>

684
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:35,030
aware applications over our socks proxy

685
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,399
again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case tour so this way we</font>

686
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:40,490
can take applications that don't have

687
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,440
native support for our socks proxy ftp

688
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,750
being a great example and we can force

689
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,760
them through our socks proxy regardless

690
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,370
and not worry about ftp being the one

691
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,460
errant connection on our machine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

692
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:54,290
in fact not properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymized so for</font>

693
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,850
the most part we are automatically socks

694
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">off eyeing all non socks</font>

695
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,480
where clients and protocols and we've

696
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,520
done this with a collection of scripts

697
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,919
so that if you run any network enabled

698
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,389
binary from inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an animal s it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

699
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,000
automatically going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have its traffic</font>

700
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:12,200

701
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,360
have native socks proxy support so this

702
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,429
brings us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what is next and I</font>

703
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:20,149
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> say unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I originally</font>

707
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,890
everybody would be happy we'd all

708
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:29,570
celebrate unfortunately we didn't quite

709
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,760
hit the mark so our next version

710
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:34,010
although pretty far along it's still in

711
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,690
private alpha I won't give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a release</font>

712
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,760
date but I will say we have made some

713
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,890
changes some of the changes you'll see

714
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,230
here in our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of slides and</font>

715
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,970
our roadmap slides but I did bring

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we're going to release</font>

here at this at the conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

718
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,970
otherwise I figured I'd be lynched at

719
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,418
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation so what's</font>

720
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,460

<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody that's used it knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

722
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,000
really this is something that's

723
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,370
dependent entirely upon the nodes that

724
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,220
you're connecting to or through as you

725
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,449
browse to your eventual destination

726
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,070
sometimes you get lucky and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

and hey for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all intents and purposes you</font>

730
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,120
can't tell you're going through an onion

731
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,559

736
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,020
affects performance when you happen to

737
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:30,500
hit their node again as I mentioned

738

739
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,960
usage this results in two things number

740
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,510
one semi sucky performance number two

741
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,539
enormous consumption of the file system

742
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:43,669
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have a good effective</font>

743
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:45,710
compressed file system that we can use

744
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,630
like we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to if we were</font>

750
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:08,870
that has also been tuned out in our next

751
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:10,430
version in this case most everything

752
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,409
statically compiled and therefore

753
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:15,440
there's a lot of library redundancy and

754
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,900
further the way we built this system

755
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,510
because we used ports and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases</font>

756
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,100
when we installed a porter a package we

757
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,440
ended up with multiple versions or

758
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,659
iterations of certain libraries that we

759
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,920
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily need but to be honest</font>

760
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">we just haven't gone to the trouble of</font>

761
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,510
removing the old<font color="#CCCCCC"> G libs and old versions</font>

762
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,210
of things that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> installed by ports</font>

763
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:37,580
tree so again the distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

764
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,200
small and it definitely has some some

MOS in that file system is not laid out

775
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:10,970
to avoid constant seeking across the

776
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:17,090
surface of the CD roadmap up meetings

777

778
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,830
in fact some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do at boot time</font>

779
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,840
we basically expand part of the file

system into<font color="#CCCCCC"> rams so the portions of the</font>

783
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,650
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems that we debated as</font>

00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,120
we built this was we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really know</font>

785
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,280
what type of machine you're going to be

786
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,879
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on so working within the</font>

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,740
constraints<font color="#E5E5E5"> of potentially 128 Meg's of</font>

788
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,110
memory all the way up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a gig of memory</font>

789
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,580
we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that what we did</font>

790
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of applied across the board</font>

791
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,449
regardless of which system you're using

792
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,129
now at this point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got to</font>

793
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,630
got one of our beta scripts where we're

794
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,640
detecting memory and then basically

795
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,860
determining which tools to throw into

796
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ram after we determined how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much memory</font>

797
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,120
the system has but they're still

798
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,200
tweaking to do there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

799
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,540
been helpful and it's been effective

800
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,480
unfortunately a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the base system</font>

801
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,980
again runs directly from the CDE and you

802
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,230
know you'll hear it if anybody in the

803
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,580
room is booted not<font color="#CCCCCC"> mos your see Ron</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">drives going to go nuts almost the</font>

805
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,460
entire time you're using it you're just

806
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,000
seeking across the surface of the CD

807
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,000
constantly

808
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:40,879
so 22 points to answer that question

809
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:42,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're not really enforcing encryption of</font>

810
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:44,988
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

811
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:47,600
recommending and we're trying to ensure

812
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:48,979
that default configurations will point

813
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,019
you in the direction of I'm a pass

814
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:52,519
instead of imap so there's nothing we're

815
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:54,409
really doing to enforce encryption

816
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,419
except at the tour layer tour provides

817
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:57,769
its own encryption as part of the onion

818
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:58,909
routing process but other than that

819
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:00,889
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing anything to</font>

820
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:02,779
enforce it again we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> our PF</font>

821
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:04,969
filters tighten down pretty well so

822
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:07,580
hopefully you're passing encrypted

823
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,889
traffic inside of the tour session above

824
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,629
and beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> that though in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general I</font>

825
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:13,879
don't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the overhead of say I'm</font>

826
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:16,189
a pass vs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm app running across tour</font>

827
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:19,340
makes a noticeable difference it's

828
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,749
probably measurable I to tell you the

829
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,879
truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the order</font>

830
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:25,129
on which order of magnitude it would be

831
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:27,709
but I don't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the additional</font>

832
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:30,259
encryption at the protocol layer at

833
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,029
layer 7 for client apps web and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mail</font>

834
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:33,259
makes that much of a noticeable

835
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,239
difference and I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason being</font>

836
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:38,059
to be honest is towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottleneck</font>

837
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:39,619
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> tor is the it's the slow point and</font>

838
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:41,269
so therefore anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else we're doing</font>

839
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:43,668
above and beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's got plenty of</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> vary in mind though that also</font>

845
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,418
affects anonymity because it makes for a

846
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,909
much more predictable<font color="#E5E5E5"> path that a client</font>

847
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,830
is taking so there are a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

848
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:09,239
we've looked at doing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll make a</font>

couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of comments about what you guys</font>

850
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:13,080
can also do to help improve performance

851
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:15,960
towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this presentation but</font>

852
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,730
all very valid points so optimizing

853
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,249
performance again for us this means two

854
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,710
things number one optimizing speed and

855
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:25,110
that we've looked at trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to optimize</font>

856
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,059
the the file system layout so that we

857
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:30,238
can eliminate seeks unfortunately this

858
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:33,090
is a pretty daunting process for us in

859
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:35,580
that none of us are file system hackers

860
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,259

into schruted environments in all cases

885
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:29,299
again it's a defense-in-depth thing we'd

886
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:32,189
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to believe that hey openbsd is</font>

901
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,670
primary goals and our second version

902
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,960
were aid we got to make a non MOS easily

installable to your

904

hard drive number two it'd be really

905
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:13,020
really great if we could run this from a

912
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,820
we looked at doing is mounting local

913
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:29,549

directory or our buddy list or whatever

918
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,240
else it is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use when</font>

919
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,540
we're out browsing the web checking our

email or chatting with friends package

921

simulator version we've begun testing on

922
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:49,619
this and I can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you firsthand that</font>

923
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,880
an autumn<font color="#E5E5E5"> West runs great inside of</font>

925
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,010
using VMware virtual pc team use in the

926
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,570
whole bevy of them the performance is

927
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:00,089
actually pretty good especially as

928
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,440
compared to running it off of CD what

929
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:03,420
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do though is create a</font>

930
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,640
bundled version that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

931
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,430
essentially drop onto your USB stick you

932
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,660
pop into a windows box and no reboot

933
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,790
required you've got an anonymous

934
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,069
operating system<font color="#E5E5E5"> from which to run as</font>

935
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,990
well a little bit more boot time

936
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:19,770
optimization as you'll see from my

937
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:21,209
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad idea live demo as you'll see</font>

938
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,190
from the live demo we've done a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

939
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,589
automate the boot process you know are

940
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,690
you wireless are you wired what is your

941
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:29,970
network name so we think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

942
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">good but at the same time the the mums</font>

943
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,180
and grand moms aren't even going to

944
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">really know the difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between a lot</font>

945
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,720
of the what we think are simple

946
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,820
questions so we're implementing a mode

947
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,339
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically boot up an autumn OS</font>

948
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,960
you hit one button<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says go and it's</font>

949
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:44,640
going to do its best to identify the

950
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,260
first live network connection it can

951
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,270
find its going to auto-generate a root

952
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,099
password so all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that right</font>

953
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,310
now we're requiring user intervention

954
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,200
for hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will eliminate</font>

955
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:57,750
automatic evasion of egress filtering

956
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,259
this is a much longer term goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

957
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:04,440
think along the lines of<font color="#CCCCCC"> anônimo s</font>

958
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:07,770
being tunneled across dns<font color="#CCCCCC"> a la dan</font>

00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kaminski's previous exploits now you</font>

962
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,310
tunnel everything we're doing which is

963
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:15,930
inside of tour including the encrypted

964
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,150
protocols inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and then</font>

965
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,910
pushing it through DNS servers I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

966
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,410
real optimistic about this being

967
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:25,190
a very viable<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term mechanism but</font>

968
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,899
hopefully it's something that we can

969
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,700
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well and finally any</font>

970

fishing mechanisms we did some things at

971
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,609
the browser level again just to improve

972
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:36,650
overall security and anonymity we've

973
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:38,569
eliminated<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google as the default search</font>

replaced it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> screw bool screwball is</font>

the same results from google but without

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> china problem I would have to say</font>

1105
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,640
real solution to the China problem the

therefore it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult for us to</font>

come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a hundred percent solution</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">however using encrypted protocols</font>

1110
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:52,890
utilizing a system such as tour

<font color="#E5E5E5">before although I was back and forth one</font>

of the connections<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I hit between</font>

tested this demonstrated that it was

1169
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,240
possible whether or not it would go well

1170
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">it remains to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so while I'm attempting to</font>

1172
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,010
connect I guess this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> as good</font>

00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,690
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time as any for questions and let me</font>

he built essentially a pretty exhaustive

1234
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:34,899
everybody however I will say this since

I'm being videotaped I would prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

1236
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,290
love all questions but if when you have

1237
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,030
a question you happen to not be of legal

1238

1239
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:45,510
beforehand so I'm not filmed giving beer

1240
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,510
to minors in a state that's not my own

1244
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,630
could bust out here if I if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get</font>

1245
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:07,730
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but I'm jumping all</font>

1246
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,710
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of my presentation so I'm</font>

1247
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,940
trying to to go quickly it will see if

1248
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:14,840
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going it looks like i'm back</font>

1249
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:23,800

1250
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:23,800
he is leave it to skype

1251
00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:39,299
so while I'm establishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1252
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:44,279
connection do we have any questions that

1253
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:45,899
we're not already asked yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay not so</font>

1254
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:48,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">much question but regardless of all</font>

1255
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:52,969
instant messenger jabber from you

1256
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:55,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">encrypt something if I don't know if</font>

1257
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:57,629
supports the operetta messaging but if

1258
00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:59,759
it does or if yousa messenger client

1259
00:49:57,629 --> 00:50:02,098
does and you can encrypt all I am

1260
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:08,159
traffic regardless of the protocol

1261
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:09,839
you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game does have a native</font>

1262
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,189
plugin for off the record it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1263
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,899
implemented in the first version again

1264
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:15,058
primarily because there was no port for

1265
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:16,499
it but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we considered</font>

1266
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:18,239
again we're trying not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move away from</font>

1267
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:20,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ports tree as much as possible for</font>

1268
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,649
reasons of maintainability but something

1269
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,029
like off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the record is very much in line</font>

1270
00:50:22,649 --> 00:50:26,669
with the goals of what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

1271
00:50:24,029 --> 00:50:28,469
do so to not implement it<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it exists</font>

1272
00:50:26,669 --> 00:50:30,239
and builds on openbsd would be kind of

1273
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:31,979
silly so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I would not</font>

1274
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">be surprised to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see in an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upcoming</font>

1275
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:36,808
version it's not there yet so it

1276
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:41,759
probably will not be in the next alpha

1277
00:50:36,809 --> 00:50:43,499
release off the record<font color="#E5E5E5"> OTR it's a</font>

1278
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:45,749
mechanism that provides ubiquitous

1279
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:48,718
encryption and also plausible

1280
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:49,828
deniability for instant messaging chats

1281
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:51,299
I don't know who asked the question so

1282
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:54,329
I'm just scanning around randomly hoping

1283
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:56,609
that I look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the bottom line being</font>

1284
00:50:54,329 --> 00:51:00,409
not only is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it encryption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

1285
00:50:56,609 --> 00:51:00,409
instant messaging chats but it is also

1286
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,669
see if you guys can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

1287
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:09,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">here present presentation projector</font>

1288
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:10,799
what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh no I just wanted to get</font>

1289
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:12,149
in the opportunity he was on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the roster</font>

1290
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:13,499
of proposing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

1291
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:15,949
can't pull it off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to</font>

1292
00:51:13,499 --> 00:51:20,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">go ahead and demo at regardless but</font>

1293
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:24,469
nonetheless i was trying user not online

1294
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:24,469
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think he got pissed off and quit</font>

1295
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,220
so off the record would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1296
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,240
we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see and like to add because</font>

1297
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:38,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">again I think it's right in line with</font>

1298
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're doing no I can't say that we</font>

1299
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,600
have no I said let me rephrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

1300
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:45,240
can't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have active development</font>

1301
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,089
of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> item OS was probably about six of</font>

1302
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,729
us and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really i have to give credit</font>

1303
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:52,580
where credit is due I'm the idea man and

1304
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:55,080
I'm the mouthpiece for chaos theory

1305
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,940
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of much smarter guys</font>

1306
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,170
than me who are back at home<font color="#E5E5E5"> building a</font>

1307
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,360
lot of this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1308
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:03,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">this possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most specifically I have</font>

1309
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:05,730
to credit fade and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elmore who were there</font>

1310
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:07,619
are resident<font color="#E5E5E5"> bsd experts and they were</font>

1311
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:09,300
the guys that really well that almost

1312
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:11,130
beat us<font color="#E5E5E5"> into submission and made us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

1313
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,630
openbsd but they're also the ones that

1314
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:15,840
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of this work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and put a</font>

1315
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:18,060
lot of the glue into the project I hope

1316
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,200
beers look if you if you've asked a

1317
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:24,540
question and I've answered it you want a

1318
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:29,669
beer come get it it's here yes sorry in

1319
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the back we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have not even touched ipv6</font>

1320
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:35,270
yet and it's something that i'd like to

1321
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,290
see down the road but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's</font>

1322
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:38,430
debatable importance at this point in

1323
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:41,369
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is something that</font>

1324
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">is ultimately important but actually in</font>

1325
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this current version if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember</font>

1326
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:48,510
correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we yanked out most</font>

1327
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:51,000
ipv6 components in the obsd code and

1328
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,440
just eliminated any of it compiling

1329
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,310
because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really supporting or</font>

1330
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,840
utilizing ipv6 so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font>

1331
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">done much investigation into how a lot</font>

1332
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these components</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will work across an</font>

1333
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:04,560
ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> network specifically tour I don't</font>

1334
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,970
know but but it's something that I think

1335
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:10,859
will be investigating<font color="#E5E5E5"> in future versions</font>

1336
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:12,560
so anti forensics<font color="#CCCCCC"> when of your design</font>

1337
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:16,500
goals

1338
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:21,450
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> CV in that end that anti forensics is</font>

1339
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:24,540
very much a one way to phrase privacy

1416
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,069
unfortunately you probably can't even

1417
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,050
tell that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question there so i</font>

1418
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,690
will read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you at the beginning of</font>

1419
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:16,130
boot you guys saw our flashy little<font color="#E5E5E5"> mg</font>

1420
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,330
animation all the blocks coming together

1421
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:20,090
in the first question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

1422
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:22,100
presented with with we actually I think

1423
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,930
I must have hit enter already do we want

1424
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to create a password or generate a</font>

1425
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:29,299
one-time password the idea being again

1426
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,190
this is a live CD so right now nothing

1427
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,840
is saved to the drive you've got the

1428
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:34,430
option of either creating a password so

1429
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,290
something easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember or you can</font>

1430
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:39,140
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> non MOS just generate a</font>

1431
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:42,620
moderately secure one time use password

1432
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:45,910
in this case I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create one and</font>

1433
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:47,870
i will use a password the ultra-secure p

1434
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright the next question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

1435
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:51,799
presented with this part of the boot

1436
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">process Jesus I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even read you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">our timezones can you guys even see that</font>

1442
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:09,058
there's text on there at all

1443
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:11,849
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better when we get to the GUI</font>

1444
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:19,739
I swear choose a time zone we are

1445
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:23,459
Pacific so select Pacific no control

1446
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:25,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better all right now you can tell</font>

1447
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:27,058
there's text I still have to read it to

1448
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:28,439
you but it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1449
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:29,729
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've also built</font>

1450
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:31,499
in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention this during</font>

further an annuity at the lowest layer

1453
00:59:33,569 --> 00:59:37,799
as possible we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the option of</font>

00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:42,449
boot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> imma less by this we are not</font>

1456
00:59:40,499 --> 00:59:45,328
going to have a consistent MAC address

1457

goes up even in local network logs for

the proactive network admin the one

1459
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:52,140
piece of forewarning i will give you is

1460
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:54,150
do not randomized the mac address if

1461
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,949
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running in virtual pc or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vmware</font>

1462
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,900
or all the shit breaks and it won't talk

1463
00:59:55,949 --> 00:59:59,939
to anything so right now we're going to

1464
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,859
say no and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> added that</font>

1465
00:59:59,939 --> 01:00:05,189
warning in there to vmware virtual pc

1466
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:09,449
say no so we said no automatically

1467
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:11,848
configure network yes vmware video

1468
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:13,679
driver detected press any key and now

1469
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:15,630
the option to go window<font color="#CCCCCC"> door command</font>

1471
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:20,759
which will give us a GUI now if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font>

1472
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:22,259
move<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mouse I'd actually give you guys</font>

1473
01:00:20,759 --> 01:00:23,789
a full screen view of this but

1474
01:00:22,259 --> 01:00:26,189
nonetheless you'll see our network

1475
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:31,579
detection script pulling up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's getting</font>

1476
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:41,038
an IP this is vmware control shift enter

1477
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:42,599
fantastic oh yeah maybe I thought

1478
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,819
control all did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it goes all</font>

1479
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:50,130
right finally hey dig you still with us

1480
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:53,130
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so this is our</font>

1481
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:55,919
default interface upon booting into a

1482
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:57,239
knot MOS again another point of feedback

1483
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:58,949
we've gotten is hey could you guys let

1484
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:00,630
us change the background please<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1485
01:00:58,949 --> 01:01:03,330
looks anything but inconspicuous when

1486
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sitting in the school library</font>

1487
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:07,080
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fair and</font>

1488
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:08,940
understandable I think I'm stepping all

1489
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,990
over my time so I'll be brief what I'm

1490
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,180
going to do I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull up a</font>

1491
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,770
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools and show you again</font>

1492
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,470
kind of design goals here from a GUI

1493
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:18,660
perspective on the desktop we basically

1494
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:21,810
added<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> icons we've got web browser</font>

1495
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:24,149
email instant messenger and home we

1496
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:27,470
opted to do this in lieu of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox</font>

1497
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:29,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thunderbird game and home because again</font>

1498
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:32,549
my mom is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be lucky enough to</font>

1499
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,930
recognize what web browser means we'd

1500
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:38,850
probably be better off<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a little</font>

1501
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:40,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">blue e so what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will do yeah exactly</font>

1502
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:43,259
i'm going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> launch web</font>

1503
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:47,370
browser and this will fire up<font color="#E5E5E5"> firefox</font>

1504
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:49,920
again we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox 106 i believe</font>

1505
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:51,390
on this version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an autumn OS we've</font>

1506
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,000
also added again bearing in mind that

1507
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:56,609
this is fluxbox there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> right-click</font>

1508
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,560
menu available and similarly we've

1509
01:01:56,610 --> 01:02:01,640
renamed all of our tools to web browser

1510
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:04,259
email instant messengers command prompt

1511
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,279
you can jump into the advanced menu and

1512
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,690
get all of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

1513
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,920
hidden and embedded<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1514
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:12,600
jumping back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> firefox and this is not</font>

1515
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,220
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be anything remarkably</font>

1516
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,380
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if you've used tour</font>

1517
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:18,270
before but starting out it to read me

1518
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,890
the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess we will do is</font>

1519
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:22,410
jump over to the site that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

1520
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:24,420
an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where we are coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from so</font>

1521
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to jump to IP chicken calm</font>

1522
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:31,020
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like what is my IP</font>

1523
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,670
but it's got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chicken on it and if all</font>

1524
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,380
goes well we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fast enough tor</font>

1525
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:41,690
server that this will pull up before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1526
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:41,690
actually booted off stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right</font>

1527
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:57,260
where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the chicken can you uh can</font>

1528
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:59,430
you see us go no looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we didn't</font>

1529
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:04,110
looks like we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten somebody's home</font>

1530
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:07,410
modem connection for a tor server also

1531
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:09,150
very possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the network is slow and</font>

1532
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,810
tours slow<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we're toast and we're</font>

1533
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,810
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see anything</font>

1534
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:19,329
all right to a Skype connection yeah it

1535
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:22,779
probably is this guy connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:24,130
using up all my damn bandwidth<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1537
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:25,359
well I guess what I'm going to do I'm

1538
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:27,609
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and wrap here what I</font>

chaos theory website immediately after

1541
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:33,430
this presentation I'm going to jump

1542
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:35,619
online i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn up the download</font>

your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own anônimo scds and help us</font>

1548
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:49,839
figure out what what people really want

1549
01:03:46,749 --> 01:03:53,439
to see in projects like this we're happy

1550
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:57,339
that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able who and where are</font>
