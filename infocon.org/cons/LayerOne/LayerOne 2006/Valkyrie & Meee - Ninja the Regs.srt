13
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:55,530

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> GLBA socks or anything else is</font>

48
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:24,039
because we screwed the frickin pooch we

49
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:27,669
did not decide to self regulate

50
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:34,570
ourselves so we ended up being regulated

51
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:38,229
by the feds now pardon me pardon my

52
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:44,250

hey there it is so we now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

54
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:59,560
actually 326 federal regulations we're

55
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">only going to talk about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rig we're</font>

56
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of case</font>

57
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:08,200
histories we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a</font>

58
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,800
little bit about security management

59
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,030
life site life cycles the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

60
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,070
I'm saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

61
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,039
little bit about that is because

62
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,490
and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be honest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with y'all I was</font>

63
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,590
really ambitious with this but figured

64
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,400
that I was kind of like limited to an

65
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:30,880
hour and after talking with my friend me

66
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:35,950
here I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I probably was a</font>

67
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,280
bit too ambitious then we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

68
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:42,510
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of compliance</font>

69
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:46,900
methodologies how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make it right I</font>

70
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:49,539
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially if we've only I've only</font>

71
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:53,620
seen two people to raise their hands at

72
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,240
at being operational people that you

73
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:00,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys are the ones who have to implement</font>

74
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">this crap right so those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones i</font>

75
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,000
really want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

76
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:11,490

you people yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay compliance</font>

78
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:20,830
methodologies they know there are not

79
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:25,900
there is not one methodology out there

80
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:29,680
that fits every siloed organization and

81
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:33,130
I'm sorry um you can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so many</font>

82
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,620
people in this industry that would tell

83
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:41,980
you this methodology is going to work

84
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:46,540
this method up<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it depends on your</font>

85

business<font color="#E5E5E5"> silo and that's kind of one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

busy I realize that

94
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:36,840
but legislation does impact all

95
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:41,090
industries take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this you've</font>

107
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:33,829
regulations we just put up here there

108
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:36,870

have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay take a look at</font>

112
00:08:49,470 --> 00:09:02,600
how much it<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs um that was last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

113
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:06,170
take a look at how much it costs to

114
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,170
comply with socks

115
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,229
let me ask you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question if you're</font>

116
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:20,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">investing that amount of money in</font>

117
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:24,329
complying with regulations how much can

118
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:31,229
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really invest in new services and</font>

119
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:36,269
new products you can't you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,310
have now not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there too many but</font>

123
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,069
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not cost-effective and we</font>

124
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:53,430
shouldn't have clients no I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

question is great and what we have and

139
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:48,959
mitigating compliance risk involves um

140
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:54,209

<font color="#CCCCCC">me because I'm an IT person but the</font>

160
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:10,230
whole point of building and business is

161
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:14,130
a business is built on their policy and

162
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:18,180
their regulation what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do when do</font>

environment physical infrastructure and

166
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:31,380
your business processes and policies

167

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:46,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">reputation risk which has become</font>

171
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:50,750
actually a really really big thing with

172
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:56,910
a lot of companies lately<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you</font>

176
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:19,589
their failure to keep that information

188
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:14,270

we had fired him it turns out what he

224
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,080
had done mainly was just change dns

225
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,700

there there's an 8020 rule information

426
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:21,658
retention control your access and

427
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:25,159
information in progress integrity so how

428
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:29,340
do we do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that for</font>

429
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:37,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">glba HIPAA and socks i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

430
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:40,408
you go girl uh I know this is busy and

431
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:43,110
I'm sorry it's busy but just take a look

432
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:47,879
at it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to leave it up there</font>

433
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:52,439
for a while see um the thing that a lot

434
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:55,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">of folks don't grok is that you now</font>

435
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,789
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new regulatory requirements</font>

436
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:05,399
need to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're keeping your</font>

437
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:11,040
in from that was so rude that you're

438
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:13,940
keeping your information stored so you

439
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,399
need data management storage management

440
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:20,480
guess what you know if you're publicly

441
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:25,029
traded you got to save it

442
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:31,540
get over it don't have to like it don't

443
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:31,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to like it but that's the rule so</font>

444
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:41,149
information retention this is the one

445
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:44,830
that just cracks me up<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so many</font>

446
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:48,770
companies they don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

447
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:56,810
access management and control for their

448
00:34:48,770 --> 00:35:00,950
individual users if somebody can give me

449
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:04,369
an actual awesome idea on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

450
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:06,980
I would love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have worked with</font>

451
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:10,670
several companies as a matter of fact

452
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:14,619
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies I've worked with it</font>

453
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:18,500
took me a year but we ended up putting

454
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:22,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">together an identity management system</font>

455
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:27,100
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ASAP that actually</font>

456
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:31,609
worked out quite well but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

457
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:35,210
very important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I probably</font>

458
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:44,810
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have renamed this and what do you</font>

459
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:48,020
think I'll figure it out process

460
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:52,369
integrity take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we've got</font>

461
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:56,780
under this see most companies don't want

462
00:35:52,369 --> 00:36:01,750
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> invest in data want to invest in this</font>

463
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:04,460
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to invest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to UM</font>

464
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:08,060
taking a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at anomalies that come</font>

465
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:12,640
into their environment and subsequently

466
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:19,400
it resolve them Security's not important

467
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:24,339
bullshit it's crap you need to ensure

468
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,340
and trick integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your environment</font>

well actually that's a that's a good

474
00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:06,038
point that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes deeper to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UM</font>

475
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:12,578
actually analyzing who are we what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

476
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:16,710
do why do we do it when do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do it most</font>

477
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:20,049
companies don't have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin clue</font>

478
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:24,549
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have never done the</font>

been that companies that don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

516
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:42,160
end up having to go back reengineer this

517
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:45,569
crap and guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

the paranoia basically the subject to

basically they don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to build</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need cav eye contact edit I mean</font>

635
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:51,029
most hospitals i go to actually have

636
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:52,680
that that's a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> story ensure</font>

637
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,540
their confidentially integrity and

642
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:08,520
other people don't pry into it

643
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,230
unfortunately that's that's most

644
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:15,350
hospitals that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've looked at have it</font>

645
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:15,350
really addressed that consistently

648
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,950
covered entities basically for hospital

649
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:30,110
and you have clinics<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should be able</font>

650
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:32,669
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate with them yes sir five ok</font>

651
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:35,400
because infective ambiguous and

652
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:38,310
predictable basically they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

653
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,920
you to spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty billion dollars to</font>

654
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:45,060
secure your network infrastructure but

655
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:47,760
um Peppa costs actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot the past</font>

656
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:50,370
few years there are many hearings but

657
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,380
unfortunately they act as even small

658
00:47:50,370 --> 00:48:00,870
mom-and-pop medical institutions and

659
00:47:52,380 --> 00:48:03,250
clinics implementation in 2005 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't have this line</font>

661
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:09,340
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have the site and the rules</font>

00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rules supposing</font>

663
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:15,580
ambiguous and predictable we have yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

664
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means yet security</font>

665
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,600
rules our items not covered usually in

666
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:21,310
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy rule such as the axis of</font>

00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,160

668
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:26,860
communication of data the<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy rule</font>

669
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,200
does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually cover these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four so</font>

670
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,730
they basically implemented the security

671
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:36,549
rules that was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> written bit</font>

672
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:38,380
later on so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trying to</font>

673
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,380
focus more on the access and auditing of

00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the users pay access to information so</font>

675
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:47,560
basically if I'm a<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care provider</font>

676
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:49,120
if i look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> patient X the audit log</font>

677
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,630
should actually show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have looked</font>

678
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,609
at patient neck so for some reason the

679
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,900
patient X's<font color="#E5E5E5"> boyer want to know who acts</font>

680
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:59,340
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information they could actually</font>

681
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:01,860
go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the logs and find out who</font>

682
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:04,030
let's go down here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom</font>

00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,950

686
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:14,490
care you everybody here had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fill a</font>

687
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:18,730
prescription at another pharmacy right

688
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:22,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yes No like go to for all greens to the</font>

689
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:23,710
Costco well basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to</font>

690
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,729
transmit the information one way or

691
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:30,700
another unfortunately if the first of

692
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:32,590
all the sender is required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is call</font>

693
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,689
them up try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirm the fax</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

694
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,280

695
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:37,930
wrong the only thing that's covering the

696
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,900
entity sending the information is

697
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:42,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually this nice small sheet that says</font>

notify us right away the that also

703
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,160
protecting them is this small<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of</font>

00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:06,130
something like that also their

708
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,620
exploitation nabol parts of HIPAA I see

709
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:11,590
most doctors calling clinics and say I

usually tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose extension if the</font>

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,930
calling outside the campus I would

739
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,900
usually say I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not giving this person</font>

any information I mean it's not in the

their office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give them the</font>

745
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:12,240
fax this information over I mean but

746
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:14,940
it's subject to exploitation and also

747
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,790
mistakes i mean people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font>

748
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,530
an eight could be a three I mean a long

749
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,970
time ago I have patients get a malaise

750
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:22,790
test because i was actually signing my

751
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:25,350
initials saying I did it and

752
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,990
subsequently 300 patients got a malaise

753
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,950
tests which was five hundred dollars at

754
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:33,930
the time

755
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:37,618
I was corrected quickly say I wanted me

756
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk with you all because I don't</font>

757
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:45,930

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:09,240
legislation before Congress that

764
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:13,980
actually came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out before right before</font>

765
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:18,618
she and i decided to collude on this

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing this information and then</font>

790
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:35,819
a big national database because most

00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,589
hospitals actually keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on site and</font>

most hospitals will not release

00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:03,119
you want that I should take away from

799
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,890
your talk you're saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a</font>

800
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,079
lot of scary things in the pipeline like

801
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:09,270
a national health database which I agree

802
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:11,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with some but you're also saying look</font>

803
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">at all this regulation it's costing us a</font>

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money certainly it is and then</font>

805
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,788
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> proceeded to say look some of this</font>

806
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:19,680
regulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best example I can you</font>

things undefined are not clearly defined

809
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:24,270
right saying HIPAA should be revamped

810
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,859
are you saying it should just be

811
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:28,020
scrapped and a new thing should be

812
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:30,288
created for scrap it regulation all

813
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:33,420
together I don't understand with your

814
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:37,440
what what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you is</font>

815
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:40,859
this there is a way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk away from</font>

816
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,440
this and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of like hoping that</font>

817
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:47,700
you guys would get it from the past

818
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:54,529
three slides on my slide deck there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

822
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:07,618
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess we may be screwed the</font>

823
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:13,379
pooch on that but that's what we were

824
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:15,660
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take away with this updating</font>

regulation

826
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:22,270
there's there's no way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update the</font>

827
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:27,369
regulation to address it because guess

828
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:31,320
what over the past three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years the</font>

829
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:34,119
regulations have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated so often</font>

830
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,720
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have been tracking the</font>

831
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:41,260
regulations over that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

832
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:46,000
three areas of management that you as an

833
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:50,290
Operations person can address to keep

834
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:59,170
from going postal on your internal

835
00:56:50,290 --> 00:57:02,590
regulatory people you want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know no</font>

836
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:05,280
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even ask me that question I</font>

837
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:09,550
don't want to go there I think not

838
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:17,290
personally I think that regulation in

839
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:20,740
that arena um is ill thought and totally

840
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:27,690
ill-advised and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it needs to be</font>

841
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:32,618
rethought however hello hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI I</font>

842
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:38,560
realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there perhaps needs to be</font>

843
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:41,950
some regulation and how we deal with the

844
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:45,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">management of user and personal</font>

845
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:50,080

846
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the feds have got it right at trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

847
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,130
update compliance laws and we're failing

848
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,410
that I've got these simple steps

849
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:58,540
identity

850
00:57:55,410 --> 00:58:00,819
whatever two companies nothing to secure

851
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:03,040
this what's why would a company do that

852
00:58:00,819 --> 00:58:05,770
if it's not being acquired by law<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

853
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">those go right you're saying that the</font>

854
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:12,150
laws right now we're too loose no I'm

855

00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:46,290
creating new services on my network on a

876
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:50,980

877
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:53,579
something needs to be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

the regulations that we get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

880
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:02,540
well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking you that question</font>

881
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:05,690
because you're part of the community but

886
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:29,000
really has very little power over

887
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:30,830
changing the existing regulations so how

888
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,450
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with this because quite</font>

get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the crux but really that was</font>

895
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:04,670
where I was going there are three major

896
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:07,549
areas that anyone for<font color="#CCCCCC"> glba</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> socks HIPAA</font>

897
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:11,810
can focus on that's going to focus on

898
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:14,740
the eighty percent of the pain so that

899
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:16,850
anybody who has worked excuse me and

900

of eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your pain that is</font>

903
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:28,279
going to be your identity management

01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:31,609
your storage management that's it that's

905
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:33,830
