<font color="#E5E5E5">I can later come see me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so good</font>

2
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,740
morning everybody I'm Strom Carlson<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

3
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:10,440
welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to layer 1 this presentation is</font>

4
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,530
called hacking fedex kinko's how not to

5
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,640
implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored value card systems</font>

6
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,250
helmet just just before we get started

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,869
how many of you know what I'm going to

8
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about how many of you saw the</font>

9
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:25,470
little video that i sent huh cool how

10
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,369
many of you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the hell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

11
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about it all glad you're</font>

12
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,759
paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention screw and how many how</font>

13
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,380
many of you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for either</font>

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">FedEx or in track and came here and and</font>

15
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:49,800
aren't too chicken to raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:50,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well so from as you know how many</font>

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,229
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've been to a fedex kinko's</font>

18
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:58,310
recently at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all okay so why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we do</font>

19
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:02,220
this let's get into the theory and I'll

20
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,860
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the details later so what</font>

21
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,660
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smart card well a smart card is a</font>

22
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,489
small plastic card roughly the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:12,359
credit card it typically carries a

24
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,980
microchip and smart cards aren't just

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,080
limited to cards with contact pads you

26
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,670
can have cards with contact pads cards

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,890
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> little antennas inside so you can</font>

28
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,329
you know just pass them over readers you

29
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,679
can wave your wallet over a reader for

30
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,230
example as you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the subway and</font>

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,400
it'll protect the proper fair or you can

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,959
have a combination of<font color="#CCCCCC"> both I've seen</font>

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,540
cards where you wave it over the reader

34
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,989
to deduct fair and you plug it into a

35
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">machine to actually add fair and this is</font>

36
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,849
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a small little</font>

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,260
typical smart card right here now the

38
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,609
fact that they're called smart cards

39
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,250
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that there are a little more</font>

40
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,450
intelligent than mag stripe cards and

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,890
those are your credit cards where you

42
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,329
swipe them and you're familiar with them

43
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,859
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> died after a while there</font>

44
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,860
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost smarter than script kiddies</font>

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,990
so there's two<font color="#E5E5E5"> varieties of smart cards</font>

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,280
there's the microprocessor based cards

47
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,900
but there's the really fancy ones you

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,180
find Mont credit cards they've got a

49
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,090
microprocessor<font color="#E5E5E5"> or some ram some flash</font>

50
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">ROM they are often</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operator optimized</font>

51
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,800
for cryptographic functions and like for

52
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,450
example if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sim card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and your gsm</font>

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,730
phone the way that works is that

54
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,130
authenticates use the network by a

55
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,310
challenge-response the phone network

56
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,140
sends you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge and then your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sim</font>

57
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,540
card because it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> that microprocessor</font>

58
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,730
and knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> what to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that code will</font>

59
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,739
compute a response based on the code and

60
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,660
then send the response back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone</font>

61
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,320
network and if the phone network

62
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,880
determines the phone network has already

63
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,470
has already computed its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of</font>

64
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,000
the response and if the two match then

65
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,090
it knows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your yes you're the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,730
chip and you correctly process<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code</font>

67
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,020
and so therefore you are this chip we

68
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,340
sent out in your authenticate onto the

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,050
network also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cards like the American</font>

70
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,520
Express credit card that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the smart</font>

71
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,880
chip in it that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

72
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,800
microprocessor-based card there's memory

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,290
there's cars with simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> EE proms</font>

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,940
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microcontroller and they</font>

75
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,500
can sometimes perform basic security

76
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,620
functions like<font color="#CCCCCC"> write protect or</font>

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,570
sometimes really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple cryptography and</font>

78
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,730
there they tend to be cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> than then</font>

79
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,130
the microprocessor cards and you find

80
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,839
them more in situations where like the

81
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,390
card is free or it's a low value

82
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:26,070
application or they're not expected to

83
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:29,400
last a long time so one specific variety

84
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,380
of smart card is the SLE<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44-42 it's got</font>

85
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,679
it it's a very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> very cheap chip</font>

86
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,690
it's got a 256 byte<font color="#CCCCCC"> ee prom the first 32</font>

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,970
bytes of the chip are irrevocably<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

88
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,320
protectable you can write you know a

89
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,940
header to them and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can write</font>

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,700
basically there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a header</font>

91
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,480
there's manufacturer code there's a code

92
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,760
which identifies the specific

93
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,170
application of the card and then you can

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,820
write protect those permanently so that

95
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,610
those can be never<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed again for</font>

96
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,550
the life of a card<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can read the</font>

97
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,770
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> 250 256 bytes of the card at any</font>

98
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,300
time just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick it into a reader and you</font>

99
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,460
can read update off there is no

100
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,840
protection<font color="#CCCCCC"> from reading there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

101
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,080
there that's secret there's nothing that

102
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,388
you

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,150
can't read<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lexi there is but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to</font>

104
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that shortly you can only write to the</font>

105
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,219
card after you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented a specific</font>

106
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 byte code to the microcontroller and</font>

107
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:19,439
the code varies from application to

108
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,000
application but typically what happens

109
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,000
is when you purchase these cars from the

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">manufacturer you specify ok I want the</font>

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,680
code to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 123456 and they'll</font>

112
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,310
pre-program all the cards with those

113
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,719
code and so when you're done when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

114
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,610
get the cards they all have that code

115
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:37,259
and you write<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and the code is</font>

116
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,030
supposed to be known only to you it's a

117
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,129
secret so no one else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find it out</font>

118
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,318
and so presumably if nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else has</font>

119
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,969
this code then no one can write to your

120
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,120
cards and alter your wonderful valuable

121
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:49,289
data and there is a protection against

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,210
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know tinkering with these</font>

123
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:53,250
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car does become completely</font>

124
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,780
unrideable after you inch present the

125
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,960
correct the incorrect code three times

126
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,590
so if you get a sack of 5.6 million

127
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,620
cards and have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of free time and</font>

128
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,029
you can brute force the cards but that

129
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would take an extraordinarily long</font>

130
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:14,009
time but it's possible theoretically so

131
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:17,429
I I took one apart actually and and

132
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,759
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chip on a dime a tiny little</font>

133
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,440
thing so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how these are</font>

134
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,310
suited to actually be in smart card

135
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,699
applications because they are pretty

136
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,860
tiny so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to use this</font>

137
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,930
chip if it has if it's not so great a

138
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,240
chip as far as security goes well it's

139
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,580
really really cheap in quantities of

140
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,830
200,000 that's Marco roll calm I found

141
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,628
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> online for 36 cents each and I'm</font>

142
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,150
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you're buying more or if</font>

143
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,889
you you know go to some manufacturers

144
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,029
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have websites or if you go to the</font>

145
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:46,469
manufacturer directly instead of a

146
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,990
resale you could buy them even cheaper

147
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:51,150
twenty fifteen cents each the security

148
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,930
function does prevent the casual

149
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,580
attacker from altering data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

150
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,050
someone who's just going to look at it

151
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,580
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just has one card who isn't</font>

152
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,779
really determined to alter everything

153
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,609
but just has a reader and is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

154
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">poke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be able to just</font>

155
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,129
go oh hey let me change this to this

156
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,169
it's presented so it prevents the casual

157
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,270
attacker from screwing around big data

158
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,979
and the chip tends to be more durable

159
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,359
and secure than a mag stripe card i mean

160
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,330
the mag stripe is readable at any time

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,460
it's writable at any time

162
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,109
and the magstripe swear out so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

163
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,090
these you can throw in the washing

164
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,099
machine you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an acid</font>

165
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,039
magnet over it they tend to stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

166
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:30,199
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of abuse so they're kind of</font>

167
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,050
designed to be used as a replacement for

168
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,909
max track cards now there is a common

169
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,009
application of this really cheap really

170
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:39,020
inexpensive car that I'm sure you've all

171
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:40,669
used at some point they're used by this

172
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,750
little tiny random z rock shop that

173
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:46,549
you've never heard of in your entire

174
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:48,919
life called<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinkos and this is a kinkos</font>

175
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,110
card right here you when you go to

176
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,729
kinkos the way these work is you go up

177
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,259
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kiosk and you press a button and it</font>

178
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:56,090
spits one of these cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you for free</font>

179
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:58,940
then you take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> card you stick it back</font>

180
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">into reader and you put value on it one</font>

181
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,090
to five dollars and then you go and you

182
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,710
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the Xerox machines and you</font>

183
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,840
make your copies or you go use the

184
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:11,270
computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that debits the value from the</font>

185
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,919
cards so it's called express pay is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

186
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,289
name of their system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this showed up</font>

187
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,938
they started showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it started showing</font>

188
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,500
up in around two thousand one before

189
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,539
this they had this really cheap crappy

190
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,969
mag stripe system which was apparently

191
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,199
very easy to make copies<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the card so</font>

192
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,590
they decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> what let's do something a</font>

193
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,000
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more secure so you can refill the</font>

194
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,059
cards you can use them any number of

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,159
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it turns out actually that the</font>

196
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the system was developed by this</font>

197
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,990
company in Toronto called and<font color="#CCCCCC"> tracked</font>

198
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,360
technologies and so FedEx didn't develop

199
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,890
it internally and so n track sold them

200
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful system and they said oh</font>

201
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,670
yes it's wonderfully secure these cards

202
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,720
are right protected blah blah blah but

203
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,969
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that later so the</font>

204
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,890
questions I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had using us i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was making</font>

205
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,890
copies of<font color="#CCCCCC"> edit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinkos one time and the</font>

206
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,899
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had were you know is there</font>

207
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,939
any personally identifiable data stored

208
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,800
on the car I mean theoretically these

209
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,930
cards could just have a single integer

210
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,870
on them which says seventeen dollars and

211
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:12,319
thirty-seven cents and there could be no

212
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,390
tracking nothing at all but there could

213
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
be more there's 256 bytes there's a lot

214
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,010
of space to<font color="#E5E5E5"> store all sorts of weird</font>

215
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,630
random data that you wouldn't expect is

216
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,959
there a transaction history stored on

217
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,520
the card itself you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it once you go</font>

218
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,140
once you go make your copies and use the

219
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,520
computer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything you can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

220
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kiosk and say print me your</font>

221
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,980
receipt you stick your card in and they

222
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,630
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's what you did you used</font>

223
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,580
you made 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> black</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and white copies and</font>

224
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,050
use the computer for three minutes so

225
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,320
and it'll offer to print you of receipt

226
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,029
on paper so seeing as there are 256

227
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,420
bytes you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> theoretically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coat at a</font>

228
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,100
transaction history<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the card and</font>

229
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,160
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be what's used for printing</font>

230
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,420
the receipts and the house how secure is

231
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,310
the data that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored on the card the</font>

232
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,829
card itself offers no built-in

233
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,910
cryptographic function and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it means</font>

234
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,260
the data could theoretically be

235
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,839
encrypted before you store it on the

236
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,260
card but<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow I didn't think they</font>

237
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,730
would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all that trouble it's it's</font>

238
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too much trouble</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know why would</font>

239
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,480
you want to encrypt all this data it's

240
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,250
just serial numbers and stored values

241
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,790
and all that good stuff no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one would</font>

242
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,290
want to read that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is the value</font>

243
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,120
even store it on the card itself these

244
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,589
could theoretically just be serial

245
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,330
numbers on a chip that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

246
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,490
impression of being this fancy shmancy

247
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,140
smart card system but really all they

248
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">are they're just cereal tokens as you go</font>

249
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,040
in you stick it in the reader and it

250
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:33,430
pulls<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value associated with that</font>

251
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,140
card off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and what else is</font>

252
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,239
stored on the card there is a whole lot

253
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:43,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">of storage space to store</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever data</font>

254
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:45,459
who knows right so it turns out one of

255
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,349
the problems actually that I discovered

256
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and doing this research is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

257
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,270
type of stuff isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well documented</font>

258
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,729
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little bits</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font>

259
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,829
there and there's general overviews of

260
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,080
smart card technology but there's two

261
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,570
problems first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no really</font>

262
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comprehensive volume available like</font>

263
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,180
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the bookstore you can get</font>

264
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything you ever wanted to know about</font>

265
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,560
TCP IP or ss7 but you can't go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

266
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,819
bookstore and find everything you ever

267
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,449
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about smart cards</font>

268
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,310
terribly easily so the other problem is

269
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,839
that all the literature that you can

270
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,189
find searching around for smart cards

271
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,600
tend to focus on the microprocessor

272
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,700
cards because those are fairly

273
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,730
standardized there's a whole set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISO</font>

274
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,950
standards that that the cards conform to

275
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,020
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much all the</font>

276
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,910
microprocessor cards depending on which

277
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,800
microprocessor card it is will still

278
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,969
conform to enough standards to where you

279
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,979
can write a general volume on

280
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,290
microprocessor cards and pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

281
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,660
have one volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that covers them all</font>

282
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,849
whereas these cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually don't</font>

283
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,110
conform<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all the standards they do</font>

284
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,250
conform to the first three

285
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,170
standard which are physical

286
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">characteristics the dimensions and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

287
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,769
locations of the contact points on the

288
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,560
card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> electrical characteristics</font>

00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:36,040
it's a proprietary protocol but it

305
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,269
conforms to physical standards and one

306
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,579
of the problems that you discover is

307
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,399
that the readers which are available

308
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:45,160
some of them can only read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cards</font>

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,709
you when American Express was giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

312
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:54,190
the free readers a while back how many

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:58,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you got like a whole ton of them just</font>

314
00:12:54,190 --> 00:13:00,670
screw what so yeah well I know I got a

315
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,410
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of them and so it turns out</font>

316
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,089
that those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> only good for reading the</font>

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,219
microprocessor cards you can't read

318
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:08,740
these cards in the American Express

319
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,089
readers and so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

320
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,040
have to go find a reader that can read

321
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,350
the card and there are some readers

322
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,529
which actually state they can read I so

323
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,180
76 a sip all the ISO cards plus you know

324
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,920
the following memory cards and it turns

325
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,359
out there are a bunch of memory cards

326
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,880
each one with their own proprietary

327
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:30,519
standard so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the ACR 30 you it's</font>

328
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">this little USB reader that works under</font>

329
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,810
windows and linux it reads this card and

330
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs about 30 bucks on smart card</font>

331
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:41,800
supply com so that was fairly easy go

332
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:46,120
online order it free shipping there it

333
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:49,120
is next<font color="#E5E5E5"> day so I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

334
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,890
cards and I got a whole stack of cards

335
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,420
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I decided to pick through</font>

336
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,649
them and I visually grep them and saw

337
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,160
what changed and what stayed the same

338
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,970
from car to car so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a dump of a</font>

339
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,800
fedex<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinko's</font>

340
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,740
card here's all the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's stored</font>

341
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,620
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little tiny microchip 256 bytes</font>

342
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,810
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that difficult and so looking at the</font>

343
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,639
data and correlating it with what

344
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,680
happens at the store you know you do

345
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,180
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you go and you buy two cars</font>

346
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,680
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sequence you see what happens so</font>

347
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,719
you go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you buy a card and you've</font>

348
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,420
dumped the data then you spend ten cents

349
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,430
you see what changes and so looking at a

350
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,449
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different cards I came up</font>

351
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:28,329
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so the first 32 bytes are the</font>

352
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,949
header file for the card they remains

353
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:32,888
the same across all the fedex kinko's

354
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:35,680
cards when you go and you buy the

355
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:37,689
generic SLE<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44-42 is online if you buy</font>

356
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,489
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small quantities at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

357
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:40,959
card supply com they're like two bucks

358
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,240
each but if you buy a larger quantity

359
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can to get them for like 70 cents</font>

360
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,649
sixty cents so on and so forth so the

361
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,160
this remains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same across all the</font>

362
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:53,379
kinkos cards and actually it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

363
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">was playing with one of the first blank</font>

364
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:56,589
ones that I bought and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well I</font>

365
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonder what happens if I go and I just</font>

366
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,100
stick this in the reader of fedex

367
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">kinko's well it turns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out it turned it</font>

368
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,610
into a kinkos card and I I couldn't so

369
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,980
there was two bucks wasted and I could

370
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,290
no longer rewrite the header so then the

371
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:15,069
dollar value is stored here in the next

372
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight bytes and so using 8 bytes to</font>

373
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,430
store a single dollar value is seems a

374
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,579
little ridiculous but I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

375
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,800
health assist or later there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

376
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:25,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">stamp for the date and the time the card</font>

377
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,878
was first issued actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

378
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:30,009
this bike here is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the time</font>

379
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,769
stamp but I've seen in instances where

380
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:34,350
this gets changed to just zeros and the

381
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:37,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">timestamp still seems to say the same</font>

382
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,829
since this was developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in 2001</font>

383
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:40,809
and onwards that they wouldn't seem to

384
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:42,609
be concerned about four years anymore

385
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:45,069
because this company is kind of stupid

386
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,470
it turns out so it would make sense that

387
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:50,170
it only starts with 05 but this time

388
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:54,100
stamp itself is you know September 21st

389
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:57,628
2005 about 40 five in the afternoon is

390
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,889
when this card was was first issued

391
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:02,230
there is a serial number that's stored

392
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,120
on the card and actually when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

393
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,250
print the receipt at<font color="#CCCCCC"> fed of kinkos the</font>

394
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,589
serial number from the card is printed

395
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,290
on the receipt so this is fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

396
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:11,830
correlate and it turns out that the the

397
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,740
first

398
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,910
or digits of the serial number are the

399
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,640
store number where the card<font color="#E5E5E5"> was issued</font>

400
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:21,300
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 1163 I think that's in West Los</font>

401
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,370
Angeles somewhere I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember and</font>

402
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,290
then the end of the cards just increment

403
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,180
as you go along so each time<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new cards</font>

404
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,730
issued it gets a number which is one

405
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,370
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous card and this is</font>

406
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,780
stored<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decimal coded ascii africa</font>

407
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:40,150
thought the exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is it is but</font>

408
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:41,620
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another time stamp which as far</font>

409
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,959
as i can tell for every card that's

410
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,960
issued at a machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exactly the same</font>

411
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this time stamp but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did one card</font>

412
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,850
where I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the went to the counter</font>

413
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,670
I said hey can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give me a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two-dollar</font>

414
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,140
card and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she grabbed a card and she</font>

415
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,410
took my true dollars and she manually

416
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:02,170
made the card and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp was</font>

417
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,969
actually I think they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

418
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">stamp looked like when she started</font>

419
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,410
issuing the car<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when she finished</font>

420
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,599
typing in all the data so there was like

421
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,060
a 20 30 second difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

422
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,199
two but other than that I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find any</font>

423
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,740
significance<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you have a question</font>

424
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,030
cult<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then there's more actually</font>

425
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,720
which I didn't highlight here like for

426
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:26,440
example this is a ski which says cash

427
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,360
customer just plain old a ski and then

428
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,990
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what this is this is just</font>

429
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,490
more you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> decimal coded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ascii and</font>

430
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,290
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what that's for i think</font>

431
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,840
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a marker to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> identify this as</font>

432
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,220
an express pay card because it turns out

433
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,800
that when you like I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

434
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like I tried altering a whole</font>

435
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,610
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> values and if you alter</font>

436
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,860
these values specifically the card<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

437
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:52,179
goes blank and it itches a brand new

438
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,469
card on the same chip so the store

439
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,120
dollar value is kind of interesting

440
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,620
because everything else is pretty dumb

441
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,810
and easy to understand just by looking

442
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,030
at it but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't make any sense i'm</font>

443
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,770
looking at these values and they're very

444
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,080
confusing you know they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 bytes</font>

445
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,900
to store the data and these don't seem

446
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,820
to correlate at all to you know what's

447
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,580
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on obviously it's signed so you've</font>

448
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,129
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like these are all the dollar there</font>

449
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,810
3f and then BF is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

450
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,880
same the<font color="#E5E5E5"> four cents is the same as</font>

451
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,429
negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 cents but the sign changes</font>

452
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,650
but everything else is the same and then

453
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,690
once you get beyond like you know two

454
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,529
dollars these change

455
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,779
who's here all sixes but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

456
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:34,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">bucks but it doesn't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any sense just</font>

457
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:36,250
looking at it and so I went round and

458
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,769
round around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked to people and they</font>

459
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,000
had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> clue and then after about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

460
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:41,350
months I got the bright idea to just

461
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,740
take one of these and stick it in google

462
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,879
and so it turns out it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Triple E</font>

463
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,500
754 double-precision floating-point

464
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:52,480
values and which is really amusing

465
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,940
because the maximum value you can store

466
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,730
in one of these is a hundred thousand

467
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,200
sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> ilion dollars this is a hundred</font>

468
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:04,450
thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> Antillean dollars just to give</font>

469
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,860
you an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I'm sorry yeah totally</font>

470
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,120
ready for inflation maybe that's why

471
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,189
they chose it but just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an</font>

472
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of how big this number is if you</font>

473
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,710
take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google and cube it and then you</font>

474
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,179
multiply it by I think 10 million or

475
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that you get this number</font>

476
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:23,559
and there's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google of subatomic</font>

477
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:25,990
particles<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the known universe but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

478
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,549
you can have a card with more dollars on

479
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,129
it and there are subatomic particles in

480
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:34,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> known universe so I mean you know</font>

481
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:34,620
solve the national debt with<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinkos yeah</font>

482
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,340
small change please small unmarked

483
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:44,799
non-sequential bills right so if you

484
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,959
want this quickly that's 130 a to the

485
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:52,029
negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so let's get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

486
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,159
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> code which is at this point now</font>

487
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:55,899
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I figured out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way the</font>

488
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,750
dollar value is stored this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

489
00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:00,820
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but standing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my way of playing</font>

490
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,950
with these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out that</font>

491
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,889
the card is protected by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three bite</font>

492
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,840
security code that's only 24 bits there

493
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:10,959
are 16.7 million possible combinations

494
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,620
and based on my research before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I figure</font>

495
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,029
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do this the I decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

496
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,639
all the kinkos cards probably had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

497
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:20,259
same code because the blank cards if you

498
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:21,789
just take a card<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the kiosk it's</font>

499
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:23,500
blank on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no scratches whatsoever</font>

500
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:25,658
looks like came fresh from the factory

501
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,009
don't ever sick in the kiosk and just

502
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,990
take it home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and diddle with it</font>

503
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:30,610
with your card reader it doesn't have

504
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,470
the default security code that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blank</font>

505
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:35,830
ones you buy from smart card supply com

506
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,899
do they have a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> code which so</font>

507
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,379
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the default and so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

508
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:41,449
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's the code</font>

509
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,160
they've you know secretly decided on

510
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:47,360
with the manufacturer and only kinkos

511
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,890
knows so and deriving the code from

512
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,229
changeable data on the card my card

513
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,550
caused the car to become inoperable if

514
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,920
the changeable data somehow becomes

515
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,360
corrupted and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of a</font>

516
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,500
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for kinkos because you know</font>

517
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:04,070
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer they what did I do</font>

518
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,260
there we go you got a customer who who

519
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,850
gets like a twenty-dollar card makes

520
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,350
five dollars worth of copies puts the

521
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,840
card in their wallet goes home<font color="#CCCCCC"> for two</font>

522
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,149
weeks somehow damages the card you know

523
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,120
a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data gets twiddled somehow you</font>

524
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,560
know gets flipped and now because the

525
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,689
security code has to be derived<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

526
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,340
that important bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data the card no</font>

527
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,590
longer works the machine says sorry your

528
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,330
cards invalid and there's nothing that

529
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,560
the because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know obviously the</font>

530
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,659
employees are can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do</font>

531
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,490
forensics on the smart cards unless

532
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,080
you're hiring really well paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinkos</font>

533
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,350
employees which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think is going</font>

534
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,610
to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time soon you know the</font>

535
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,199
customers crap out a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

536
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers pissed off the customer never</font>

537
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,860
wants to go to kinkos again and that's a

538
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,860
bad thing from a business perspective so

539
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:54,080
yeah yeah and everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

540
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,570
card is so ridiculously simple and so

541
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,159
fought up by a two-year-old anyway that

542
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,270
it doesn't make sense as they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all</font>

543
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">this trouble to protect the data so how</font>

544
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,280
do you attack this this is it this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

545
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:10,040
diagram that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I derived from the data</font>

546
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,870
sheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the SLE 44-42 and actually if</font>

547
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,750
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to smart card supply com and you</font>

548
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,399
click on SLE 4442 they have the data

549
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">sheet for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the card freely downloadable</font>

550
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,200
so you chose the protocols data

551
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,330
structures everything there's actually

552
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,920
this card has become discontinued and

553
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:28,070
there's a new version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card called</font>

554
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,410
the 4452 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 5542 I can't</font>

555
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,689
remember anyway all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's changed is</font>

556
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,330
the contact pad has changed a bit the

557
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,310
chip<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now got like a layer of metal on</font>

558
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,189
it instead of being in an epoxy bubble

559
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:43,040
and the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheet for the chip is now</font>

560
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:46,880
no longer freely available but the old

561
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,440
one is so the security code can only be

562
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,510
read once<font color="#E5E5E5"> the correct code has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

563
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,030
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the card so there's actually</font>

564
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know some fairly simple logic so if</font>

565
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font>

566
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,720
are going to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> write you have to</font>

567
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,639
go through the security logic and the

568
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">protection memory the protection memory</font>

569
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,740
basically is just 32 bits each bit

570
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,480
specifies whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,730
bytes of the protectable memory is write

572
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,230
protected so these bits are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

573
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">turned on only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so once you turn it on</font>

574
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't turn it off and that's not</font>

575
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,920
that important but every time you write

576
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card you have to go through the</font>

577
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,790
security logic and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have if</font>

578
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,040
unless you've presented the correct

579
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,830
security code<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the car during that</font>

580
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,780
session the security logic won't let you

581
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,370
actually write data to the card you'll

582
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,870
you'll think you're writing data but the

583
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:34,520
actual memory won't change so you've got

584
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the code somehow you can't pull</font>

585
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,810
off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> card directly so there's four</font>

586
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,030
possible attacks that I thought up one

587
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,950
would be a social engineering attack one

588
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,540
would be emulating the card itself one

589
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,940
would be somehow intercept the code

590
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:50,060
during transmission and one would be

591
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,280
read the memory off the card directly so

592
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,840
the social engineering attack is I

593
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,450
basically decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> what work would be to</font>

594
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,340
contact and track<font color="#E5E5E5"> and extract the code</font>

595
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,260
from some unsuspecting employee so you

596
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,090
pretend to be some field engineer or

597
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,250
someone another<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department you say hey</font>

598
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,990
I'm working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this for kinkos and I</font>

599
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,030
need the code could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you please tell it</font>

600
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,270
to me or send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me your email it to</font>

601
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,250
me or something so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know seeing is</font>

602
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,870
there such wonderfully so wonderfully

603
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">security-minded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure they would go</font>

604
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,070
to great steps to protect this

605
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,840
information but and the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is it</font>

606
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,030
requires no technical jiggery-pokery of

607
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,399
any kind you just call up you get the

608
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,200
code there it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is but the problem is that</font>

609
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,910
the code might be so secret that no one

610
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,340
but n track engineers even know about it

611
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,480
and maybe the engineers you're battling

612
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,649
with management management<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

613
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,210
something simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and quick and the</font>

614
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,890
engineers<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying no is security but</font>

615
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,170
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> will let them so you never</font>

616
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,640
know and if they change the code you

617
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,830
know it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be kind of suspicious</font>

618
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,650
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the code every</font>

619
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,629
time they change it and it's not really

620
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:51,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">a technical challenge its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a social</font>

621
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:52,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">one so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only good a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times and</font>

622
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,600
doesn't really have any long-term

623
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,390
solution and it doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove</font>

624
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,860
that the card is vulnerable there's an

625
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,720
emulation attack which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought will be</font>

626
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,500
really slick but I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the code</font>

627
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,540
foo or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the know how to do this one</font>

628
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,010
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> one option</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to use an emulator that</font>

629
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,690
you plug into a laptop and you

630
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,129
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these they look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like smart</font>

631
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,510
cards but they got this big dongle off

632
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,330
the back and the cable that runs into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

633
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,160
laptop and you use these for testing out

634
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,419
applications and generating prototype

635
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,600
cards without actually having to go

636
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,220
through real cards and so I mean this is

637
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> develop smart cards</font>

638
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,640
there's be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of foolproof but the</font>

639
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is the dongle at the end of the</font>

640
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,120
emulator is kind of bulky and the way

641
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,070
the transport mechanism for these cards

642
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,060
work is you go to Kinko's and you stick

643
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,280
the card in the reader and the reader

644
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">has this motorized transport which pulls</font>

645
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,830
the card about depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which reader</font>

646
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,389
you're putting it into either<font color="#E5E5E5"> about half</font>

647
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,970
an inch<font color="#CCCCCC"> to two inches into the reader</font>

648
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,590
and so something big<font color="#E5E5E5"> thats hanging off</font>

649
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,540
the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card isn't really going</font>

650
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,429
to be that useful as far as that goes

651
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,080
because it'll get stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little jam and</font>

652
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,590
the new year will never get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to contact</font>

653
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you're screwed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and since this card is</font>

654
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,020
so simple I mean there's emulation

655
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,700
software for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced</font>

656
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,889
microprocessor cards but these are

657
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,960
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple memory chip cards and I</font>

658
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,400
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to determine easily whether</font>

659
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,500
or not there was emulator software

660
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,670
available for it so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not exist</font>

661
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,470
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other really cool idea I had</font>

662
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,640
which I want to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just didn't</font>

663
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the time or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

664
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,330
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a microprocessor-based smart</font>

665
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:20,480
card or a pic or something that you can

666
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,639
make behave<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like this chip so you</font>

667
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,940
know you you get your generic card and

668
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,680
you program it and you go and you your

669
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,300
sticker than the reader and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> epic</font>

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,720

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,950
you take your card you just read the

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,550
it in the card itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> suck it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font>

677
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,740
this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because if I</font>

small card supply com this is the card I

681
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,600
got from laundromat so I mean it you can

682
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,300
tell they're kind of very

683
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,919
similar-looking and if someone hassles

684
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,060
you about it which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really doubt they</font>

685
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,800
will but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if someone does hassle you</font>

686
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,110
about putting us non kinkos card into

687
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,639
the reader you could say Oh stupid me

688
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,229
that's to my laundromat card I wasn't

689
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,010
thinking let me pull out my real card

690
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:14,600
use that one instead so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

691
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,340
elegant attack because any system that

692
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,020
uses uses this type of chip is

693
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,550
vulnerable because of this attack I mean

694
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,570
you just take it and stick it in any

695
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,700
reader and if

696
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,720
tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nestle 44-42 you copy fit</font>

697
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">it off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a known card and there you go and</font>

698
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,509
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this is every</font>

699
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:32,630
microprocessor card I've seen seems to

700
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:35,059
follow all the 7816 specs not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4442</font>

701
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,559
specs so that was kind of an impediment

702
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:38,059
I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much time to go</font>

703
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,590
traipsing<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and coding around</font>

704
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:44,408
looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the third option is to</font>

705
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,939
intercept the security code somehow and

706
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:49,899
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea had was to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cards</font>

707
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,789
contacts wire them to a logic analyzer

708
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:54,918
go to kinkos you know with the logic

709
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:57,740
analyzer and do a transaction capture

710
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transaction data and go and</font>

711
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,549
analyze it and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

712
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,750
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get small USB logic</font>

713
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:05,720
analyzer about three to four hundred

714
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,370
bucks the wires can be easily hidden you

715
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just take the card and run a</font>

716
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,939
wire up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sleeve or something and you</font>

717
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:12,110
got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your backpack so in</font>

718
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,350
order to never know the difference just

719
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:19,039
some kid<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a backpack right and the</font>

720
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,600
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also since you're</font>

721
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,549
using a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> esteli for turf reported</font>

722
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,840
you there's no chance or little chance

723
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:25,279
that the card being rejected because it

724
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,709
didn't look like a real card because it

725
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,120
is a real card the only problem is if

726
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,950
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that good with a soldering</font>

727
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,389
iron these chips are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of difficult</font>

728
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,509
to solder things<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the contact pads</font>

729
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:38,629
and you can destroy many many a card by

730
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:40,399
not soldering right you know you'll warp

731
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:45,559
the card<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> burn out the chip you'll</font>

732
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:47,719
make it unusable yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly if you</font>

733
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,918
wire it wrong it'll get stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

734
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,029
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run and leave your</font>

735
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:54,620
fingerprints everywhere so that's no

736
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:56,360
good and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other option is</font>

737
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn the epoxy off the chip and read</font>

738
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,590
the security memory directly and you

739
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:02,029
could do this but and it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

740
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the activists mucking about with</font>

741
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:06,200
transactional data but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font>

742
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:08,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really expensive unless you</font>

743
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,279
know someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you know the ability</font>

744
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,659
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment and the scanning</font>

745
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:14,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">electron microscope and everything to</font>

746
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:17,450
redirect their off the silicon die so

747
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,389
let's attack this right let's let's stop

748
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,330
talking theory and have some fun so I

749
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:25,158
decided to do the logic analyzer attack

750
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,870
so i soldered my wires to a sword value

751
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,669
card attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logic analyzer and went</font>

752
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,500
off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinkos and you can see I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

753
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:32,550
your wonderful soldering skills like I'd

754
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to solder everywhere and</font>

755
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,960
but I mean this is exactly what i did i

756
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,070
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like little pieces of</font>

757
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,470
transformer wire that you wrap around

758
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:44,530
coils to make the electromagnets and

759
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,180
just burn the the insulation off the

760
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,440
edges saw it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the cards and make</font>

761
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,330
this really primitive ribbon cable out

762
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,760
of electrical tape and then take like a

763
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,320
pin header<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibotta fries and you know use</font>

764
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,080
that and the way that my logic analyzer

765
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,179
works is it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> little pin headers to to</font>

766
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:03,399
stick on to these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> pins around</font>

767
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:05,920
these pin headers and so I go and I do

768
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,150
my attack and I come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I get all</font>

769
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:14,110
these bits like well that's useful

770
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:17,020
you'll see a bits so what I had to do of

771
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,600
course is there are certain commands

772
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,460
that you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for and actually</font>

773
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way this works if you look there's</font>

774
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,990
five pins there's a reset pin there's a

775
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,640
voltage pin there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ground there's I oh</font>

776
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,500
and there's clock so there's only

777
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,360
actually one pin that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to</font>

778
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay attention to like you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

779
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the reset to see when it resets the</font>

780
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,330
chip and know that ok that's the start

781
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a transaction the others aren't so</font>

782
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,679
important as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the data goes so</font>

783
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,379
it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single line serial data so</font>

784
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,420
it's pretty easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to do there there's</font>

785
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,550
actually and so this pin is a non

786
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:51,880
connect and this the ISO<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 8 16 Dutch</font>

787
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,409
spec for get asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> us actually specifies</font>

788
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight pins on the card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you look</font>

789
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:57,340
at like my laundromat card has eight

790
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:59,770
pins but since two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pins are no</font>

791
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,389
connect anyway and this pins also<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

792
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,190
connect but these two down here are no

793
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,630
connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so to save money and make</font>

794
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,250
it a cheaper car they just don't put

795
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,900
those pins on the card saves money on

796
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,540
gold and contacts and manufacturing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

797
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,130
everything so we get all this binary

798
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:15,940
data that dumps out of logic analyzer

799
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:18,190
and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these commands then you</font>

800
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,750
look if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the if you look in</font>

801
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> white paper for the card it tells</font>

802
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you all these commands there's re it's a</font>

803
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,520
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple command set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

804
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,130
chip your read<font color="#E5E5E5"> mem memory update the</font>

805
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,000
main memory read the protection memory

806
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">right the protection memory read</font>

807
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,440
security memory right security memory

808
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,270
and compare verification data so each

809
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,890
command there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very simple</font>

810
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure there's a command bite there's</font>

811
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,870
an address by there's data<font color="#E5E5E5"> byte and then</font>

812
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,669
so whatever goes on that's that's how

813
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:45,340
you that's how the card interfaces with

814
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,150
the reader so you start picking through

815
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,459
the data

816
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,650
oh and so the what you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

817
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this specific protocol for presenting</font>

818
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,160
the security code<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the card you read</font>

819
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,080
the security memory you update the

820
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,940
security memory and you do three compare

821
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,889
verification data steps each<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

822
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,270
a compare verification data command then

823
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,800
a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> by indicating which by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

824
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,990
security code follows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one two or</font>

825
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,360
three and then one bite of the security

826
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,640
code then you update the security memory

827
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,590
again any read security memory again and

828
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,180
if that all goes correctly and Eve's you

829
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,870
presented the correct code then the card

830
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:19,840
will let you write<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the chip so this</font>

831
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:22,179
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the very start of the of the</font>

832
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason of the of the transaction there's</font>

833
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,560
an answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reset and this is the first</font>

834
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,120
four bites off the header<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the card</font>

835
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,550
then there's a processing cycle and then

836
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,110
hey here's read main memory started bite

837
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,940
15 and read to the end of the memory

838
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,409
there's a processing cycle then here

839
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,990
comes all these bites that we saw

840
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:40,600
earlier you know the header the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

841
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:43,360
the card the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp the serial number</font>

842
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,040
and so forth and this is just going

843
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,929
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and because of these processing</font>

844
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,270
cycles would you don't know how many how

845
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,350
many bits are going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

846
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">just write something to split it into</font>

847
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,399
evenly eight bits and and figure out

848
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay here's where it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

849
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">manually step through each bits for each</font>

850
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,490
bite and say oh hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where this</font>

851
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,540
one ends and this is where this one

852
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:10,150
begins so thousands of very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very boring</font>

853
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">bytes later we find this read security</font>

854
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:14,560
memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> update security memory and then</font>

855
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,840
there's a processing cycle compare

856
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,570
verification data one here's a bite

857
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,760
compare verification data<font color="#E5E5E5"> to here's a</font>

858
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,620
bite compare verification data three

859
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,210
here's a bike update security memory

860
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,330
blah blah read secure why am I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

861
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,590
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I was gonna put them on</font>

862
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,090
the cars but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought the better of it</font>

863
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,159
so it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> X's and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you read here</font>

864
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:35,409
says I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information security</font>

865
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,550
responsibility cupcake and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is my job</font>

866
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,970
to tell you that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

867
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:46,330
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code all for yourself also</font>

868
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:50,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">dead hookers boobies yes oh and just for</font>

869
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,399
screw fifty percent more cat sex

870
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,500
so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security code we</font>

871
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,120
come in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> plate the card and I was</font>

872
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,530
gonna just do this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

873
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,270
didn't want to give you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>

874
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,800
code but then I remembered oh yeah I've

875
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:12,460
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> this blank card with a default code</font>

876
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,220
so i can show you how it works so let me

877
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,409
pull up this so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the application</font>

878
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,899
that actually comes from the

879
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:22,569
manufacturer of the smart card reader so

880
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:26,050
you take your chip you<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stick it</font>

881
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:29,740
in there pull up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory card tab can</font>

882
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:33,400
you all read this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you look</font>

883
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:35,620
siemens here's SLE 4442 you pull that

884
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,100
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we can read the main memory</font>

885
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:43,900
here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it starts reading the chip</font>

886
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:46,870
does a reset and everything and so

887
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,610
there's the memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

888
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,918
easy all you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is take the key</font>

889
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,380
and so let's pretend just just for the

890
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:55,719
sake of argument that we're going to

891
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:59,260
enter the wrong code so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one two three</font>

892
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">four five five or something it's like</font>

893
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:07,380
oops wrong code now you only have two

894
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:12,330
chances to ya to input the correct code

895
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:15,040
so the default code on these is all f's

896
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,509
put that in and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey now it's</font>

897
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,100
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to three because if you put the</font>

898
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,260
correct code in then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> resets the error</font>

899
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,680
counter so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've put in the</font>

900
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,270
correct code we can update the update

901
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,440
the card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is actually buggy it</font>

902
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,850
should say hey you been to the correct

903
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,710
code but it says incorrect now you've

904
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,569
got three chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorrect now you've</font>

905
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,090
got three chances<font color="#CCCCCC"> incorrect now you got</font>

906
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,350
three chances so but it will still let

907
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the card because the card</font>

908
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,490
smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the application is dumb so now</font>

909
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,370
we write to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card and we can do</font>

910
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:53,520
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't know dead beef</font>

911
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:53,520
cafe Oh 123456789 you know whatever 2368

912
00:35:53,970 --> 00:36:00,399
then hey there it is so now we were able

913
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,540
to write our data to the card and that's

914
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,960
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's on the card and if you</font>

915
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,960
do a read

916
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:15,230
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't I I'm smart so it like</font>

917
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,349
it reads the data off so there's the

918
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:22,550
card and that's that's how you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

919
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:24,589
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that we can play with the value I</font>

920
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,359
should note that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maximum value you</font>

921
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:29,839
can put on a card at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kiosk is one</font>

922
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:36,619
hundred dollars so i took this wonderful

923
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:40,640
photo and so and this proves that we can

924
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:42,410
now write to the card so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> went public</font>

925
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,240
with us actually at the end of

926
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">February's and we did a whole security</font>

927
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,348
disclosure and we posted<font color="#CCCCCC"> this photo and</font>

928
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:51,079
everyone said no this photo is a fake

929
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:53,900
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not possible so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made a video</font>

930
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:55,490
of us hacking the cards and posted it up

931
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,750
all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and got like</font>

932
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">seventy five thousand downloads or</font>

933
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,119
something it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually kind of</font>

934
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:01,339
amusing because we put this up and

935
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,630
kinkos said no based on what we know

936
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:03,859
about these cards you're not supposed to

937
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do this you can't do this</font>

938
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:08,328
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a hoax blah blah blah blah</font>

939
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">blah and so we posted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the video and they</font>

940
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:14,319
said and they backtrack to but they're

941
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">like ah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe not maybe you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can and</font>

942
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:19,819
so my guess as to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened was</font>

943
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:21,259
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinkos had never developed this</font>

944
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:23,450
it was all in track that developed it

945
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,069
and track sold it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinkos and said hey</font>

946
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,259
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is totally secure don't worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

947
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:29,210
it and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinkos believed it was totally</font>

948
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,710
secure and so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're probably</font>

949
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:35,329
screaming at each other pointing fingers

950
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:38,210
and saying hey what of it so now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

951
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:40,400
know now that we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to how to</font>

952
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,609
modify the cards we can now play with

953
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,329
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend system and see what and see</font>

954
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:48,799
what we can do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some fun I'm</font>

955
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:52,940
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad 9x isn't here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because you got a</font>

956
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:54,319
kick out of a slide so if you've ever

957
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,819
been into a kinkos this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical</font>

958
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:58,220
diagram of what a kinkos looks like

959
00:37:55,819 --> 00:38:00,079
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key one kiosk you got a</font>

960
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:04,540
bunch of tools you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pcs like</font>

961
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,540
maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac some copiers and so on</font>

962
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,070
they're all off in the back smoking

963
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:14,030
having coffee getting high on stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

964
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know the dead hooker is hidden</font>

965
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:20,360
inside the copier there's there's

966
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:24,830
different varieties you know depending

967
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:36,610
on your taste in dead hookers color yeah

968
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:38,660
color black<font color="#CCCCCC"> and white</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever so so so</font>

969
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,370
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so the first thing that I</font>

970
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,440
tried was let's just try card cloning

971
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:44,299
and see if the system because the thing

972
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,890
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had were does the</font>

973
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">system actually keep track of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cards</font>

974
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,210
or does it kind of just implicitly trust

975
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,320
whatever stored on the card I mean doing

976
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,490
the implicit trust of everything

977
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,290
distorting the card to be really dumb

978
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:57,500
but it's not too not completely

979
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:59,300
unexpected so the first question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

980
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,190
the system reconcile the balance on on

981
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sistah on the network with the</font>

982
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,850
balance<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the card so what you do is</font>

983
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,440
you buy a one dollar card you clone it

984
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,670
you make a Xerox<font color="#CCCCCC"> titude with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

985
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,780
original card and then you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go</font>

986
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,040
and print your receipt from the kiosk

987
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,320
with the clone car that still has a

988
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,060
dollar on it and see what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

989
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,800
I did this and the receipt said you made

990
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,450
two copies at<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty at ten cents each</font>

991
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,820
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spent twenty cents and</font>

992
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:24,799
your balance is now a dollar so it turns

993
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">out that when you do a balancing Korean</font>

994
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,730
and print up a receipt it does the

995
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,740
transaction history based on the serial

996
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:34,450
number and then it does it prints the

997
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,450
balance based on what store on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card</font>

998
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,839
so the second question does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font>

999
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,879
do anything if the card balance some

1000
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,800
suddenly increases you know maybe maybe

1001
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,320
that's designed so that you know if the

1002
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,330
copier didn't somehow debit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car it</font>

1003
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,910
wouldn't raise any alarms it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> theer</font>

1004
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:51,620
it's possible so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you buy a one dollar</font>

1005
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,660
card you rewrite the card to two dollars

1006
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,589
you make several Xeroxes of course less

1007
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,960
than a dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth because you want to</font>

1008
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:59,300
commit fraud and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> print a receipt at</font>

1009
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,620
the kiosk and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this and I did</font>

1010
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing where I made the Xerox</font>

1011
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:06,710
and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you bought a one dollar</font>

1012
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:08,029
card and you made one<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tencent copy and</font>

1013
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:13,880
your balance is now a dollar or ninety

1014
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:15,920
cents so the second one weird serial

1015
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,720
numbers does the system freaked out of

1016
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,950
it if it encounters a serial number from

1017
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,990
some non-existent store

1018
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:23,390
because the first four digits are a

1019
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:25,189
store number then theoretically there

1020
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:28,520
should only be cards from stores that

1021
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:30,380
exist like there's no 99 68 there is no

1022
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">such sore as 99 680 there's no such</font>

1023
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:35,599
store as 7 715 or whatever so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

1024
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,710
if there was I've never encountered a

1025
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,210
card with serial number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 6 5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 so</font>

1026
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:43,730
you know this should theoretically never

1027
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:45,079
happen in real life you're never going

1028
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,790
to encounter a card with that but you

1029
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:48,680
buy a one dollar card you alter the

1030
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,779
serial number you make a Xerox to see

1031
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,279
what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it works you make a</font>

1032
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,859
Xerox and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you print the receipt</font>

1033
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,270
and says your card serial number is 996

1034
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:58,130
eight seven six five four three<font color="#E5E5E5"> two one</font>

1035
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made a copy your balances 90 cents</font>

1036
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,270
have a good day it doesn't care where

1037
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,220
your card comes from it only uses the

1038
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:09,710
serial number it seems to track the

1039
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:11,689
number of copies you make so you can

1040
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:14,180
also it turns out cash these cards in

1041
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:16,460
you can go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can say oh hey I'm</font>

1042
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,140
done using the card I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 bucks on it</font>

1043
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,940
but it turns out only need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

1044
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">bucks worth of copies can I jump life up</font>

1045
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,420
five bucks back and the employee will<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1046
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:24,920
yeah sure here you go here's your<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

1047
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">bucks back they'll of course read the</font>

1048
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,930
card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see what sort on the card but</font>

1049
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:32,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll give you back your money so the</font>

1050
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:35,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is if you invalidate the car if</font>

1051
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,099
you your cash in the card does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it become</font>

1052
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,220
invalidated or can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still use that</font>

1053
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:41,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">card because they keep they insist on</font>

1054
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,470
keeping the card after they cash it out

1055
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">for some reason so what you do is you</font>

1056
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,730
buy a one dollar card you destroy it

1057
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">this whole all these tests are designed</font>

1058
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,390
to specifically avoid actually

1059
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,920
committing fraud and that's kind of the

1060
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole point you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1061
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,410
security research without committing

1062
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,980
fraud so you don't wind up in federal

1063
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:03,799
pound me in the ass prison

1064
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,030
so you buy a one-dollar card<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know you</font>

1065
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:12,830
guys wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to be there but um</font>

1066
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:14,119
you buy you buy a one-dollar card in

1067
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,740
your destroys then you buy a second one

1068
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:17,930
dollar card and you make a Xerox with

1069
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,330
that one dollar card then you clone the

1070
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:23,240
card and you go and you take your

1071
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,310
original card and you say to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your fellow</font>

1072
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,589
happy kinkos helpful kinkos employ you

1073
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,670
say hey I want mine<font color="#CCCCCC"> IV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense back so</font>

1074
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:30,790
look at it and they give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> naughty</font>

1075
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,440
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and you go you walk away and</font>

1076
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:35,359
you walk back to the kiosk you walk back

1077
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the copier stick in your cloned card</font>

1078
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,460
and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make a Xerox with it and see</font>

1079
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,050
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens and you print</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a receipt and</font>

1080
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,400
it turns out this works just fine you

1081
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:46,670
take the clone card you can make more

1082
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Xeroxes with it and the receipt printer</font>

1083
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,369
doesn't say anything it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1084
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,320
here's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> card here's your copies</font>

1085
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:54,109
here's your balance have a good day and

1086
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,580
so I thought well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe it</font>

1087
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:57,710
takes some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for the card to be</font>

1088
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:01,040
invalidated so I went off I ate some

1089
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:05,020
pizza I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came back like 30-45 minutes</font>

1090
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,970
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried it again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> card still worked</font>

1091
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,920
so i decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok maybe maybe maybe maybe</font>

1092
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,959
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a whole day maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a whole</font>

1093
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,060
week to invalidate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cars so i went</font>

1094
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,800
back six days<font color="#E5E5E5"> later and i tried using my</font>

1095
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:20,690
clone card again and it still worked so

1096
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,760
it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that there is no security</font>

1097
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,970
whatsoever with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards the only</font>

1098
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,950
thing that they do is they stress that

1099
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,709
no one can write the cars because no one

1100
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,689
has their secret code and if you can

1101
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">write to the cards you can do anything</font>

1102
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,220
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kinkos with these cards you can make</font>

1103
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,570
a hunt near 10 cards at have a hundred

1104
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:42,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars each on them and no one would</font>

1105
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:43,730
ever know did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mention that this</font>

1106
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:46,119
company that developers has only this

1107
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:50,999
product

1108
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:50,999
and their slogan<font color="#E5E5E5"> is counterintelligence</font>

1109
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:58,779
yeah I'm sorry is it yeah it's on the

1110
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:04,960
website you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to counterintelligence</font>

1111
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:08,049
and track technologies so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish I was</font>

1112
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,769
making this up I<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously do but I'm</font>

1113
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:13,210
not so how do you engineer a better

1114
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:15,549
system if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement a</font>

1115
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:17,829
stored value card system how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1116
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:22,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do it so it's not this piece of</font>

1117
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:25,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">shit well first off there are two</font>

1118
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:27,519
options replacing all the cards might be

1119
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,259
expensive you know these are cheap cards

1120
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,788
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've designed this is around the</font>

1121
00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:33,309
concept of the fact that the cars cheap

1122
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:34,990
you know the cards are free and manage

1123
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:36,999
the customer and you're really care if

1124
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,470
people take them away because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

1125
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:40,269
you're making profit on the copies and

1126
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,709
whatever so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to keep these</font>

1127
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:42,910
chips and also it's a big hassle if

1128
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,680
you've got you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all these cars and</font>

1129
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:47,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">circulation to phase them out and</font>

1130
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,149
replace them with a new type of chip so

1131
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:50,410
if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the chip you're</font>

1132
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,759
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to change the way values</font>

1133
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,529
are stored first off you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font>

1134
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:55,269
change the way the security code works

1135
00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:57,400
and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change a method for</font>

1136
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:59,379
verifying the cards because just you

1137
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,640
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that oh it has the right</font>

1138
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,710
security code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has the right</font>

1139
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,390
header isn't verification at all it's

1140
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,099
very easy to copy these cards and it's

1141
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:08,410
very easy to pretend to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1142
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:12,970
you're not the problem with doing this

1143
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:16,058
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of insecure so how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

1144
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:17,348
this first off you can like do things

1145
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:18,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">with hashes you can generate a hash</font>

1146
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:21,220
based on the serial number the value and

1147
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:22,660
timestamp and verify that against a hash

1148
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,519
stored on the server so you you know

1149
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a serial issed of serial numbers</font>

1150
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,749
and listed hashes sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> against them so</font>

1151
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you only store a hash once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1152
00:45:28,749 --> 00:45:31,899
generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a card with that serial number</font>

1153
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,538
so this protects against things like

1154
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,039
fake serial numbers or taking an

1155
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:37,960
existing card and altering the data

1156
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,269
because you know now that you've

1157
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,710
verified it against the hash you know if

1158
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:43,779
it doesn't match the hash then hey the

1159
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,630
cards been screwed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow and and</font>

1160
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:48,220
you're out of luck you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> store a</font>

1161
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,569
second hash on the card based on the

1162
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,399
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> day to verify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the card itself</font>

1163
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:53,049
hasn't been altered I mean you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1164
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,730
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a like one hash and then</font>

1165
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:56,499
something which<font color="#CCCCCC"> appears to be completely</font>

1166
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,239
unrelated to the data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card and</font>

1167
00:45:56,499 --> 00:46:00,009
you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way if someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1168
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:01,720
diddles with your plain text value

1169
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,130
you then you still verified it against

1170
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hash and oh wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a second that's</font>

1171
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:08,200
changed shouldn't allow this card you

1172
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,189
notice or anything in plain text on the

1173
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,069
cards either I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1174
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:14,260
ridiculously easy for me a phone freak

1175
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:16,210
who doesn't hack computers to reverse

1176
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,010
engineer and if you encrypt the data

1177
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,900
somehow or if you hatch it or something

1178
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:21,850
and make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know just look like</font>

1179
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,530
random data and not appear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1180
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:26,080
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense just by</font>

1181
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:27,670
looking at it from just by looking at on

1182
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">a screen then it's more difficult to</font>

1183
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,800
reverse engineer it you can not store

1184
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,810
value on the card itself at all you can

1185
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,150
just have serialized tokens and pull the

1186
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:38,830
value from the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can store</font>

1187
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,270
a hash on the car to verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1188
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,590
the network hasn't been altered the only

1189
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,570
problem with this of course is if you

1190
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,950
know you get a card and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can read the</font>

1191
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,630
serial number and you change the serial

1192
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,069
number well all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a sudden you don't</font>

1193
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:49,390
have your one dollar card you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> bob's</font>

1194
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:52,840
hundred-dollar car that he booked before

1195
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:55,509
you and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can invalidate the cars</font>

1196
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:01,600
where cashed out duh that would be a

1197
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:02,740
smart step and you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> one a good</font>

1198
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,299
idea would be don't use the same

1199
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,339
security code for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single card in</font>

1200
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,960
circulation did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1201
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,760
security code that i discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

1202
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,550
same for<font color="#CCCCCC"> every single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinkos card out</font>

1203
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:19,180
there so how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have kinkos</font>

1204
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:21,120
cards on you one wow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was expecting</font>

1205
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:29,290
more people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring them into the talk</font>

1206
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:32,470
I'm sorry so but yeah any card that

1207
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:34,120
you've got i could rewrite so you can

1208
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,459
use the code derive some randomized

1209
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,319
rotating value stored on the network

1210
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:40,030
which you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've there so you</font>

1211
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,640
know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would work because you</font>

1212
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:44,170
know that as you do transactions with

1213
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,730
the car this code is going to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1214
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:48,190
you keep a record of that changing code

1215
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,960
so even if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a logic</font>

1216
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,820
analyzer and discovers the code it's no

1217
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:55,210
good because<font color="#CCCCCC"> every time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> card</font>

1218
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,830
the code changes and don't face the code

1219
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,320
on le any value stored on the card

1220
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,450
itself because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak dumb you</font>

1221
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,540
say oh this card is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 about twenty</font>

1222
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:06,069
dollars the code is 74 oh this card is

1223
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:08,880
fifteen dollars the value is<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore</font>

1224
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:11,370
71 yeah

1225
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficulty to the customer either</font>

1226
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:16,529
on a card a month ago and try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font>

1227
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:18,720
or bottom at another store you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1228
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,820
keep those insane to restore well see

1229
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,319
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting thing is that you</font>

1230
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:25,920
can also stick credit cards into these

1231
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:28,530
readers so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely some sort of</font>

1232
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,210
connection to a network and all these

1233
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,280
stores have internet connections you

1234
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,200
know all these stores can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm assured to</font>

1235
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,510
send out and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the actually when</font>

1236
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,069
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the data brochure for the</font>

1237
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">system from n track one of the things</font>

1238
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:43,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell you on is the fact</font>

1239
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:45,630
you can audit the data afterwards so you

1240
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,100
can alter data and you can you know see

1241
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,540
transaction history and see how much

1242
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is gone and how it's running much</font>

1243
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,420
gone out so on and so forth so it would

1244
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,000
make sense that these could all be

1245
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,890
connected together so it wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1246
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,450
that much of a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cache things</font>

1247
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,460
locally for cards in turn right<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1248
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,680
store and then upload them periodically

1249
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,000
or you know just have a store<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it</font>

1250
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,040
doesn't see it has a card it's never

1251
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,200
seen before say oh hey I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1252
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,779
where this card is the store 75 lemme

1253
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,279
query store 75 hey sore 75 you see if

1254
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,470
have you seen this card oh yeah here's

1255
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data here you go so it wouldn't be</font>

1256
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that difficult I mean this is the age of</font>

1257
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:22,049
the interweb so why not you could use a

1258
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,880
different chip you know you could use a

1259
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:26,220
cryptographic secure memory chip the

1260
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,560
atmel crypto memory chip<font color="#CCCCCC"> that use on my</font>

1261
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,089
laundromat card is more secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font>

1262
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,240
kinkos card and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just for laundry</font>

1263
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:34,830
now for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xeroxes this actually has</font>

1264
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,049
cryptographic functions built in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1265
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,940
not a full-on microprocessor card but

1266
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,070
it's a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot better than the SLE</font>

1267
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">4442 you could use chipper the</font>

1268
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,260
microprocessor you could do

challenge-response authorization

1270
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:51,360

1272
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,020
you're concerned that the new chips are

1273
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:57,029
going to be too expensive to give them

1274
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,530
way for free we charge a deposit you

1275
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:01,140
know cards currently the cards are free

1276
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:02,520
for the taking then you know or secure

1277
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,379
cars are too expensive weekend of them

1278
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,670
that well my laundromat charged me two

1279
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,890
dollars for this card I'm not losing

1280
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:10,260
this card anytime soon I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hang</font>

1281
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:13,859
out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with my life and you know</font>

1282
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:17,810
I'm sorry for two bucks yeah well I mean

1283
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,810
it's expensive piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of plastic</font>

1284
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:26,460
right right and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

1285
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,140
always get over the fear of charging

1286
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,809
people deposit by refunding the deposit

1287
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,520
if you give the card back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

little help prevent curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> tickers like</font>

myself from obtaining massive numbers of

cars for<font color="#CCCCCC"> play and analysis like this I</font>

1291
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,470
actually I I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard a lot of these</font>

1292
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:48,089
while I was playing with code so i don't

1293
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:52,578
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this quite this huge stack anymore</font>

1294
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:55,078
but so that's pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so far</font>

1295
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:58,380
resources secure science net my company

1296
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:00,180
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites from carlson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> com infineon is</font>

1297
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,339
the company manufactures the chips used

1298
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,540
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the kinkos cards atmel is the</font>

1299
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:05,910
company that makes the crypto memory

1300
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:14,550
chips and smart card supply com is where

1301
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:24,240
I borrow my stuff so QA absolutely

1302
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:25,589
nothing when you clone the card the

1303
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,790
question is when you close the card do

1304
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:28,200
you need the security code you don't

1305
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,119
leave the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security code to read the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1306
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,839
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> card but to write the data to a</font>

1307
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:35,339
second card you need that code<font color="#E5E5E5"> to well</font>

1308
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,078
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that even if you have a</font>

1309
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:38,339
card<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually tried this with one of</font>

1310
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:39,839
my blank cards remember the one that I

1311
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:41,730
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> became a fedex kinko's card</font>

1312
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:45,569
what I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was I took it with the</font>

1313
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:47,549
default code and and then put all the

1314
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:49,470
data such that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a kinkos</font>

1315
00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:51,809
card except the security code was wrong

1316
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:53,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns out that every time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

1317
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,210
a card into the reader regardless of

1318
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,069
whether you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to alter that it on</font>

1319
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:57,930
the card it tries to write to the car to

1320
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">verify that it's a real card and if it</font>

1321
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:05,460
doesn't have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right security code it</font>

1322
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:08,270
just rejects the card the security code

1323
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">is I'm not telling you</font>

1324
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,450
the question is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be the</font>

1325
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:25,980
implications if somebody published the

1326
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:28,049
security code well yeah bad karma first

1327
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,600
off but pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as the</font>

1328
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:32,940
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> code gets out any kid with 30</font>

1329
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,620
bucks and a credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card or someone who</font>

1330
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,940
knows equips who or who knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> home with</font>

1331
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:38,100
a credit card can get one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1332
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,470
readers and alter the cards to their

1333
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,060
heart's content so if the security code

1334
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,859
gets out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is why I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not giving</font>

1335
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,870
anybody to code if the security code

1336
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:48,090
gets out then you've got problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1337
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:49,529
running around altering data causing

1338
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">heroes massive headaches and massive</font>

1339
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,380
amounts of frauds and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1340
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">demonstrate this is possible but I want</font>

1341
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give them time to change their system</font>

1342
00:52:54,090 --> 00:53:01,610
so they don't have any major problems

1343
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,610
yeah plus they might come<font color="#E5E5E5"> after me so</font>

1344
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:05,310
nothing i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean like they haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1345
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,530
talked me directly we sent them a

1346
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:09,420
security advisory like the beginning of

1347
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:10,890
februari we give them plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font>

1348
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,480
respond to us I didn't say a thing so we

1349
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:13,799
went public with it and then they just

1350
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">poked her PR statements they never</font>

1351
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,700
contacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> us directly</font>

1352
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:37,190
that's true that's true yeah what<font color="#E5E5E5"> dater</font>

1353
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,329
side was basically until until that<font color="#E5E5E5"> coat</font>

1354
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,279
gets out it's cheaper for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to just</font>

1355
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:42,109
pretend it doesn't exist and not make a

1356
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:43,970
big deal of it because it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

1357
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:47,029
expensive to alter everything than it

1358
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:50,859
would be to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and you know</font>

1359
00:53:47,029 --> 00:53:50,859
assume no one's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to alter it screw</font>

1360
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yes actually it turns out you can</font>

1361
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,859
there was a slide with negative dollar

1362
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:02,210
values and in normal use this you find

1363
00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:04,700
you run into this like you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

1364
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:06,170
cents on a chip and you'll make a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1365
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,569
send copies to end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with negative two</font>

1366
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:11,420
cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they allow you to do this just</font>

1367
00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:13,430
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice but it turns out like you</font>

1368
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,020
since you can store values above and

1369
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,669
beyond a hundred dollars you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

1370
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like store- one hundred dollars</font>

1371
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:21,440
on a card you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can soar negative five</font>

1372
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:24,020
hundred dollars on a card we actually

1373
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">tried this we did like a we did a</font>

1374
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,900
negative hundred-dollar card and put it

1375
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the reader and added a dollar and it</font>

1376
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:33,589
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to negative ninety nine dollars and</font>

1377
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also tried doing like some silly</font>

1378
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:38,029
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried doing a trillion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

1379
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,770
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chip and it turns out it didn't</font>

1380
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:41,329
like the trillion-dollar chipped it just

1381
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:46,069
said there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with your card</font>

1382
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:48,559
please see an employee but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

1383
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:50,240
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it to like I forget what do</font>

1384
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,609
we like fifteen thousand dollars or

1385
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,020
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Met like I</font>

1386
00:54:52,609 --> 00:54:56,240
put a hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1387
00:54:54,020 --> 00:55:02,160
chip or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it just free wrote</font>

1388
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:04,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's fifteen thousand any more questions</font>

1389
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,410
that once the code gets out it's not

1390
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,299
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they the impediment to entry is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1391
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:12,589
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 other logic analyzer it's only</font>

1392
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:15,869
four dollars yes I made that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear</font>

1393
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:17,730
you think that it didn't want a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rear</font>

1394
00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">electrical system they can keep the same</font>

1395
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:21,930
crappy system just<font color="#CCCCCC"> simplement straight</font>

1396
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:24,150
back in the county to shut down cards

1397
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:25,078
like insecurities across work yeah they

1398
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,490
could they could do that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean they</font>

1399
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,770
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally just rewrite the</font>

1400
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,209
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and keep all the same</font>

1401
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:32,280
cards in circulation know if you see an

1402
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:34,349
old card for a time being<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know maybe</font>

1403
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,869
what you do is like if you see an old

1404
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:37,950
card you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know print up new cards that</font>

1405
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:39,660
are a different color or something and

1406
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,430
say to customers you only have another

1407
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">month to use these cards and then at</font>

1408
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,980
that point these<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards aren't going to</font>

1409
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">work anymore and so you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1410
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,390
transition period where any old card

1411
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:49,890
gets traded in for a new card and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1412
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:52,078
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that month you're all set</font>

1413
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,368
and so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same chips you've</font>

1414
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,039
got the same manufacturer just printing

1415
00:55:53,369 --> 00:55:57,990
on different colors and you're fine but

1416
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:03,440
I mean they don't even seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to</font>

1417
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:03,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to do that anymore questions</font>

1418
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:18,479
you can cash I forget with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific</font>

1419
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:19,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">store policy are the maximum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can put</font>

1420
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,020
on a card as a hundred dollars I've

1421
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,420
never tried cashing out more than maybe

1422
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:27,630
five or ten bucks at a time although I

1423
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,920
assume based on because in California

1424
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:30,990
these are treated the same way that gift

1425
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,490
cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so by law you have to be able</font>

1426
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:34,410
to cash them out for their full value so

1427
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,819
in California at least you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> cash</font>

1428
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:45,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough four hundred dollars other states</font>

1429
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:47,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know if you put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> $15,000 on the</font>

1430
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:49,400
card they look at you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a stance I</font>

1431
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,399
think

1432
00:56:55,759 --> 00:57:16,969
or possibly that might work yeah well at

1433
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:18,559
the kiosk you can't actually the kiosk

1434
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:21,219
will not accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money once you</font>

1435
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

1436
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:33,169
I think actually like it maxes out at

1437
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:36,470
100 but it'll it'll actually say maximum

1438
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:38,900
value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-nine dollars to to a</font>

1439
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:41,089
point like I probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't checked</font>

1440
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,039
at which point it says maximum value

1441
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:46,750
reached I would assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe like nine</font>

1442
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,750
between eighty and ninety five dollars

1443
00:57:48,819 --> 00:57:54,589
it won't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> too much over one hundred</font>

1444
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:55,819
dollars i mean it's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kiosk is</font>

1445
00:57:54,589 --> 00:57:56,990
designs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't put more than a</font>

1446
00:57:55,819 --> 00:57:58,849
hundred dollars on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car theoretically</font>

1447
00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:00,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't know about the cash registers</font>

1448
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:01,700
but the employees all seem to claim one

1449
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:03,558
hundred dollars is the maximum so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1450
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,970
don't think they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> let since they</font>

1451
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:08,269
know that they wouldn't put to hunt

1452
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:11,200
dollars on a card for you any more

1453
00:58:08,269 --> 00:58:11,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions dolt</font>

1454
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:25,220
legal implications and how you go about

1455
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:26,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing research well I did cover that in</font>

1456
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,310
the slideshow<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of beyond</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1457
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,080
scope of the Q&A but basically the whole

1458
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:33,619
gist of it is make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you're</font>

1459
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:35,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like dink dink with cards make</font>

1460
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you put like a dollar on it</font>

1461
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,210
then increase the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value and spend no</font>

1462
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,200
more than a dollar on that card or if

1463
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to clone a card and cash</font>

1464
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,049
I'll make sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a second card and</font>

1465
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,220
destroy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you've put money into the</font>

1466
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:44,990
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're not gonna be able to</font>

1467
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,520
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> out again or you're not going to</font>

1468
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:51,430
take out again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that way you're not</font>

1469
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:54,800
committing fraud I'm sorry keep what oh

1470
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:58,990
yes yes document at all very well print

1471
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,990
receipts everything Harry

1472
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,349
possession live after

1473
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:11,609
well I mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one for example</font>

1474
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,830
it's bending the reader it's been on

1475
00:59:11,609 --> 00:59:15,119
this whole time it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple chip it</font>

1476
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,920
isn't like a timeout mechanism or

1477
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,480
anything so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still writable the</font>

1478
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,710
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take it out you can no longer</font>

1479
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:29,099
right to the card until you represent

1480
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:35,520
the security code theoretically maybe I

1481
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:40,410
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know might be worth playing with</font>

1482
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:46,740
you yeah there's a reset when you start

1483
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:51,930
the session so i don't know i will have

1484
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:58,109
to play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at some point yeah I'm</font>

1485
00:59:51,930 --> 01:00:02,339
sorry oh yeah we sent this to them like

1486
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:04,170
I'm sorry I assume fedex hazard yes we

1487
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:06,119
haven't actually sent them the code per

1488
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:10,080
se so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of dumb to transmit</font>

1489
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:11,580
it over the network but yeah they can

1490
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,779
fight they know that they're in business

1491
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:14,310
with the company they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact</font>

1492
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:18,240
interacting up the code so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1493
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:24,589
need for us to give it to them because

1494
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:26,879
the card still work any other questions

1495
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:29,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright I'm intruding into break time so</font>

1496
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,420
thanks everybody
