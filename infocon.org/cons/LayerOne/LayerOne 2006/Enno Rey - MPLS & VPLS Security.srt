00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,420
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the presentation to</font>

2
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,760
to stay on<font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule this is what I'm</font>

3
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,620
going to talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic terms in</font>

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,480
technology then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a main mpls</font>

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,750
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call it application that's</font>

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,269
mpls VPN those exists in two flavors

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,269
there are so-called mpls VPN switch a

8
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:49,070
kind of basal layer free technology and

9
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:52,370
there's another thing called layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,469
VPNs and from this layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 VPNs there's</font>

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,419
a special flavor called vpls which is

12
00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:00,050
very interesting and promising

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:02,920
technology we will see that why they

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:06,130
deploy it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future and I'll give</font>

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,690
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> insight how it works and well</font>

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:14,660
possible security implications will

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:16,340
arise just what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my person I like to</font>

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">call myself an old-school networker</font>

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,700
that's um I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to walk in layer 22</font>

20
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,820
24 to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices and protocols</font>

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,250
I'm not very good as it comes from two

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,710
operating system security or floats or

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,960
things like that I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay in the</font>

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,408
network layer with a special focus on

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,100
security since many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and in 2001</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

26
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:44,540
found it a company or group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,429
covering IT security topics which is

28
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,619
located in Heidelberg Germany I'm the

29
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,990
CTO and i'm the founder but i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font>

30
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:53,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">away from the administrative and</font>

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,979
management stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:00,339
technology on the author of a book about

00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:03,289
pen testing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a regular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speaker i</font>

34
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,420
tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i try to</font>

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,159
discuss topics and that's why I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I</font>

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,410
hope you you will learn a bit from my

37
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,850
presentation and I will learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> from other</font>

38
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:16,519
presentations and we will be able to

39
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">discuss those things for the basics mpls</font>

40
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,680
stands for multi-protocol label

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,079
switching switching technology mainly

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,170
used for forwarding packets based on

43
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:29,239
labels so packets get something at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

44
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,458
the so-called label and this label is

45
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,560
responsible for the forwarding of the

46
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,569
packets the initial goal was to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,549
more efficient forwarding

48
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:41,298
IP based routing which is not very

49
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:43,849
efficient for several reasons and mpls

50
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:47,120
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> used in most career if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not all them</font>

51
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,858
carry a big bones and it's a basic

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,139
technology and it serves as a foundation

53
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:56,989
for something called advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> services</font>

54
00:02:53,139 --> 00:03:02,299
the label itself the main technical part

55
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:04,250
here it's a 32-bit structure which can

56
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,950
be split up<font color="#E5E5E5"> into several parts the most</font>

57
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,079
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is the so called tech</font>

58
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,988
this is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can call it the label itself</font>

59
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,879
the thing that is responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

60
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,040
dividing that's a time to live<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

61
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:19,250
are some experimental fields and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">called a bottom of stack but this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

63
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,949
too interesting for us here the main the

64
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:27,980
most interesting part is the tech is the

65
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:32,989
label which is a number which is added

66
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:35,448
to a packet as father the mechanism how

67
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:39,169
it works usually there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

68
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:42,739
mpls enabled backbone consisting of

69
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:44,959
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak mpls when</font>

70
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:50,599
a packet arrives at this backbone it

71
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:52,040
gets classified from due to some some

72
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:56,418
parameters the most important one

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:59,150
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to the destination prefix so</font>

74
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:01,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination of the packet and according</font>

75
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this destination it gets up gets</font>

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,959
labeled but it can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be according to</font>

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">a customer if this is customer a gets a</font>

78
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,209
label<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 and if it is customer be it</font>

79
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:17,690
gets level 21<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to back to that</font>

80
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:19,759
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on after the classification and</font>

81
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,880
labeling the whole forwarding is done

82
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:28,820
based on the labels and these labels are

83
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,020
swapped at each hop so the labels don't

84
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:35,449
we made the same in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole path here</font>

85
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,219
this is usually done or this is mostly

86
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:41,360
done to avoid some central label

87
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:43,930
administering mechanism some labeled

88
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,460
database or whatever so two hops

89
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,610
negotiate about the labels and their

90
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,159
meaning to them

91
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,129
the packet leaves the whole network the

92
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:55,479
labels<font color="#E5E5E5"> were moved in the packet gets a</font>

93
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:59,610
forwarding and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of classical way and</font>

94
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:04,180
routed based on IP destination address

95
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:08,110
this is the basic technology um when we

96
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,750
talk about security here whenever you

97
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,759
hear about technology used for

98
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:17,229
forwarding or routing packets the first

99
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:23,189
thought usually is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

100
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,188
eject or can I let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> move those labels</font>

101
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:31,448
this can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done but it does not have</font>

102
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:34,090
many use as as I said those labels are

103
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:37,419
negotiated locally between two points so

104
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:40,210
even if I manage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> modify a label I</font>

105
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:43,930
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to modify the path of of a</font>

106
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:47,650
packet beyond the next top as there are

107
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,560
two other boxes who have negotiated we

108
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:55,560
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do not gain much here by label</font>

109
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,719
spoofing or modifying but i already said

110
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,199
mpls is used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced</font>

111
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:06,159
services so these labels may concern

112
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,830
from many<font color="#CCCCCC"> other purposes amongst these</font>

113
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:11,680
services there is something called VPNs

114
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,990
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 layer 3 there's a technology</font>

115
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,289
called any transport ovm over mpls in

116
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,020
short at home a special<font color="#CCCCCC"> flavor of that</font>

117
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:22,029
we pls there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called mpls</font>

118
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,000
traffic engineering mainly used by

119
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:27,759
providers to optimize bandwidth usage in

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,509
the backbone and optimization of paths

121
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,430
and there's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called</font>

122
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:35,589
generalized mpls GM pls used for

123
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,529
signaling and optical networks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

124
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:41,050
many different uses for mpls aside from

125
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:43,509
this basic technology labels to get

126
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,300
forwarding paths you can see it like

127
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">this there is usually some kind of</font>

128
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,819
network structure no matter what no

129
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:55,150
matter based on what technology put n

130
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:58,690
pls on it and you can profit in several

131
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,080
ways this is the way providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Korea</font>

132
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,080
see it

133
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,580
many of these technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are relevant</font>

134
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,660
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> for providers that thing for</font>

engineering but others those VPN

137
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:18,880
services can be used of big use for

138
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,619
organizations usually as customers you

139
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:28,390
buy some MPLS based VPN service from you

140
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:31,510
from your customer or organizations can

141
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,640
use it themselves on campus networks as

142
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,640
a kind of let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> call modern VLAN</font>

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:43,330
big group companies which use mpls in

an MPLS based technology uses labels

which is no surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> for something</font>

151
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,710
called MPLS based but it's got its own

152
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:10,630
concepts and terminology it can be

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,210
technology so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you imagine kind of</font>

five kinds of attacks which I name here

give me the VPN technology interesting

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:27,420
attacks include if<font color="#E5E5E5"> swapping so violating</font>

confidentiality and<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorize the excess</font>

275
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,630
getting into internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so I</font>

276
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:40,410
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not find TOS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

277
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:42,240
interesting those attacks can be divided

278
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,540
into two kinds of attacks coming from

279
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,310
the outside so from a from customer or

280
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:51,540
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and two other attacks</font>

281
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:56,189
coming from the inside and that's an

282
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:58,140
attack that's not dependent on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPLS</font>

283
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,390
such a text against management boxes or

284
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,880
management tools if you get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

285
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:06,569
the provider box managing all those VPNs

286
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,830
you can probably modify the VPN sand

287
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:15,240
modifier traffic paths but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

288
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:19,260
particular to mpls let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

289
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">about those attacks the first one was</font>

290
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:25,260

295
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,850
here labeled packets are not accepted by

296
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,480
backbone routers from untrusted or

297
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:46,920

labels it

302
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,660
p.s duty to assign those labels it

303
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:01,569
should not accept packets arriving that

304

307
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:16,629
encounter any case where it was possible

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:20,430
to inject<font color="#E5E5E5"> label packets from the outside</font>

309
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:22,329
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer side so what about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">injection of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Labor traffic from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

internet maybe those PE routers

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,000
available from the internet anyway as

313
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:32,709
they serve other functions too so what

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,920
if an attacker and the internet tried to

315
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:40,060
to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> some VPN by sending label</font>

316
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,219
packets to a PE this usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

317
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:47,310
require he should know the attacker

318
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:50,949
should know IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and labels used</font>

319
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:53,589
to be able to introduce the packets

320
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:58,089
which usually is not too difficult in

321
00:16:53,589 --> 00:17:00,339
most networks you can assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some</font>

322
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:06,039
infrastructure device sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an IP</font>

one exists and those labels are usually

325
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:15,870
assigned in a way that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be predicted</font>

326
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,599
on most boxes so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too difficult</font>

327
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:21,039
to guess labels<font color="#CCCCCC"> and IP addresses the</font>

328
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,760
more interesting part is you should be

329
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:28,230
able to reach a PE or<font color="#CCCCCC"> P water from the</font>

330
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:32,350
internet which depends on design of the

331
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:34,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">network on provider and you should be</font>

332
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to get the package through packet</font>

333
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:41,140
with a label through to that to the box

334
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,799
which depends on several parameters it's

335
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,950
not clear up this works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> given the RC</font>

336
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,600
such package should be discarded anyway

337
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:54,820
as they come from an untrusted origin

338
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:57,580
namely<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the internet I made a lot of</font>

339
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:01,470
tests this seems to be true however on

340
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:05,168
there are two prominent people

341
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:08,019
working at Cisco and they wrote a book

342
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,730
about mpls VPN security and they stayed

345
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:20,350
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said is possible so maybe it</font>

346
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:22,720
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into a VPN why</font>

351
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:40,480
here this tool can be helpful for this

352
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:44,049
kind of attack to find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> which labels</font>

completely theoretical but there are

360
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,549
guys out there writing tools for both

361
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:13,408
attacks so we will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

could probably modify for example sites

detail later it requires the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right tools</font>

at point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack which may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

this information one must either

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:43,149
withdraw the the current information and

389
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:45,160
inject a new one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> intercept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

initial exchange which will be rather

difficult as from a protocol in from the

392

packet packet view but this at least

393
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,909
theoretically this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is possible and this</font>

394
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,660
would offer lots of opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

into European this is how the exchange

may even be a box inserted to our box

419
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:40,399
can still hear me even the fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

420
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:45,300
seems to work also and I need this one

421
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:48,180
just to explain what i'm doing now let's

422
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,580
imagine this a<font color="#CCCCCC"> text scenario there's a</font>

423
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,440
yellow VPN and there's a green VPN and

424
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,370
the attacker has by whatever means

425
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,680
access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will now try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font>

426
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:02,340
have a simple ping flowing the yellow

427
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:05,340
network and I'll modified on its way so

428
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:15,540
a box in the green network will receive

429
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:21,090
the echo response then ok this is the

430
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:22,800
box and attacker controls to give you an

431
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:26,060
impression how this thing's with the

432
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,060
labels walk so

433
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:44,249
oh ok i should give this a bit more

434
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:46,700
space hey what's happening here I don't

435
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:46,700
see there

436
00:23:51,299 --> 00:24:01,019
you can see here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a box</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the PE</font>

437
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:02,730
box let's have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two VPNs one VPN is alpha</font>

438
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:08,600
and yellow VPN is better and in the

439
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:11,460
Alpha VPN there's a network 172 31 10

440
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,049
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network that's the</font>

441
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,149
same with en this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

442
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:16,918
advantages of this technology customers

443
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:20,129
may use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same addresses they don't</font>

444
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:24,539
have to renumber whatever and for this

445
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:28,289
traffic the label 17 is used and for

446
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:31,190
this one level 19 is used we will be

447
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to see this</font>

448
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:51,520
so when a box from VP and alpha things

449
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:54,130
across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backbone we see the traffic</font>

450
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,150
arriving at this peeve available 17

451
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:09,330
attached we will be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the</font>

452
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:09,330
traffic by just sniffing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

453
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,580
so now we see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole traffic that is</font>

454
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:32,340
exchanged between those two PE boxes

455
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,928
which is mainly at the moment LEP a

456
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,120
hello message SLE<font color="#CCCCCC"> p is the label</font>

457
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:38,929
distribution protocol the protocol they

458
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:43,018
used to negotiate about labels<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two</font>

459
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:46,230
just to inform the acela live we will

460
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:52,409
see some ospf there you will see some

461
00:25:46,230 --> 00:26:06,529
bgp orders infrastructure stuff i will

462
00:25:52,409 --> 00:26:10,350
now sniff<font color="#CCCCCC"> this traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and record it and</font>

463
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:14,059
ping again so i should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to see</font>

464
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,059
this ping crossing the backbone

465
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok we have two here we have all that</font>

466
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:41,159
infrastructure self<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll delete some</font>

467
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">roles in here I see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sleeping and</font>

468
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:52,449
after this I see the ping with the echo

469
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:55,060
reply<font color="#E5E5E5"> I modify your echo reply to we</font>

470
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,970
inject it with another label to we

471
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:04,899
inject it into another VPN the most

472
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:07,120
interesting part here is this is isn't

473
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,910
it based the lab I'm running here so

474
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:14,469
ethernet source and destination

475
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:19,090
addresses here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the snap type used for</font>

476
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:21,190
mpls<font color="#E5E5E5"> 88 47 and this flea bites here on</font>

477
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,590
the label there's only one level at the

478
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:27,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment as the other one has already been</font>

479
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:30,790
popped as all between<font color="#E5E5E5"> being removed and</font>

480
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:36,030
these three bites indicated label and

481
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:44,860
the label itself from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> upper 20 bits</font>

482
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:52,080
so this one and this one are the the

483
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:55,149
lowest pit and the fifth bit so this one

484
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:00,310
this 17 can be found here and in this

485
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:05,550
one and this one here so just modifying

486
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:11,139
I should be able to get into another VPN

487
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:13,600
I'll modify it to a free one the other

488
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:19,680
VPN is using in<font color="#CCCCCC"> nineteen so there's the</font>

489
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,679
bit consisting the tour is set

490
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:36,310
this should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be all I must do so I now</font>

491
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:38,950
constructed the packet which should be

492
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:45,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to get into the other VPN before I</font>

493
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:48,520
reinjected packet I will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disable</font>

494
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,250
the spin part this box is sitting on a

495
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,340
spin part on a device at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

496
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:57,040
can only receive can only receive

497
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:00,639
traffic it can't inject traffic I have

498
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,280
to disable the spin part then<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

499
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,390
should not be the case if the depends on

500
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,210
there on the point where the attack

501
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,390
assets and what the attacker is able to

502
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,390
do

503
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,250
upgrade monitor session is disabled I

504
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:47,640
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to we inject the packet</font>

505
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:50,790
then you should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look at this this</font>

506
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,140
window here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other VPN that's</font>

507
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,899
the box sitting I just turned on i

508
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:58,380
simply packet debugging basically show

509
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:02,670
me all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I TMP packets arriving or passing</font>

510
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,130
through this router<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll even go back to</font>

511
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:08,670
that one we hopefully will see the label

512
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:12,960
packets again so if i try to re-inject

513
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:25,250
the packet now i first<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to model to</font>

514
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:30,630
convert it to hex input files 10 packets

515
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:37,170
output files 10 packets and binary

516
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:39,380
format and now just gooey and check the

517
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,380
package

518
00:30:51,740 --> 00:31:01,280
okay and you see so always a good good

519
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:04,429
feeling when a demo what's during a

520
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,520
presentation and this one what we now

521
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:10,700
see a package arriving with label 19 at

522
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,190
the box and this box situated in a

523
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:17,120
completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see if the</font>

524
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:25,670
echo reply so i was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump across</font>

525
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:30,649
a VPN boundary here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks for that</font>

526
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:34,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">i continue then I frame hopefully other</font>

527
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:38,510
interesting stuff in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation so</font>

528
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:42,080
to conclude here label modification and

529
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:46,160
subsequent VPN hoping can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done it is</font>

530
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,189
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try traverse VPN boundaries</font>

531
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:52,130
here it's a one-way street for it can

532
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,440
only be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get packets into VPN not</font>

533
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:57,679
to establish package flowing a

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example my RSVP for the next time</font>

537
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:10,340
I'll give this presentation I prepare

538
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:11,870
that how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject a label label SNMP</font>

539
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,639
packet and to get the conflicts rather

540
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,790
I've written to a box controlled by an

541
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,309
attacker or for UDP based<font color="#CCCCCC"> warmth why the</font>

542
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:22,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that does not require backward</font>

543
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:24,889
traffic you should know this attack will

544
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:26,570
go completely undetected there's no

545
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:30,530
checksum in the packet which includes

546
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:32,629
the label modifying IP had us will

547
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:35,149
usually require modifying the checks on

548
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:38,420
tool or at least some some check some

549
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:40,610
errors some IDs boxes could could be

550
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:46,070
aware of this or check some areas but in

551
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:49,340
this case mpls the customer beer will by

552
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:55,639
no mean able to to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font>

553
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:57,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">rejected packet so this works modifying</font>

554
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:01,520
the other tech modifying<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi protocol</font>

555
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,630
bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets may even offer a row two</font>

556
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,389
more efficient attacks but they are

557
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,880
much more difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform both</font>

558
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:12,750
attacks acquire required access to car

559
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,360
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is topic for lots of discussion</font>

563
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:28,170
I assume most people here and in the

00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:31,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">room a bit cautious about it's assumed</font>

565
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:33,710
to be trusted anyway so we should be

566
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:37,230
skeptical hear the sounds a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> naive</font>

567
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:39,720
however I tend to agree but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

know this thing is more more<font color="#E5E5E5"> used in</font>

569

or provide operated backbone it's

some another thing or not

641
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,339
aspect which is interesting which

642
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,290
applies to mainly these two technologies

643
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't it over mpls and virtual private</font>

644
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:17,680
lunch service to give a brief

645
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:23,420
introduction this is ether net over mpls

646
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:25,730
you can imagine is as just the customers

647
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,690
are connected or the customer sites are

648
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:34,790
connected by ethernet to a PE box and

649
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:36,500
they um frou-frou in Ethernet frames not

650
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,680
IP packets may be even less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

651
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:45,560
packets or whatever layer free protocol

652
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:47,089
or even ipx4 you use anymore and this is

653
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,520
tunneled through the network and what

654
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets out here is eating it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again so the</font>

655
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,220
sides they have the impression they are

656
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:57,200
connected directly together with this is

657
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,750
very interesting for for customers and

658
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of providers already sell this kind</font>

659
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:04,370
of stuff problem here is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

660
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,370
provides point-to-point connectivity if

661
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:10,009
there's another third side you have to

662
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,779
establish a tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the first side and</font>

663
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:16,000
establish two antenna to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second side</font>

664
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:20,180
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not very scalable if you regard</font>

665
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,790
50<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 sites and big customers have this</font>

666
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,770
is why another technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> was invented</font>

667
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,890
called vpls what's your private<font color="#E5E5E5"> land</font>

668
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:32,060
service this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is mainly the same if the</font>

669
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:35,960
big difference that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-point so</font>

670
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:39,020
you can connect different sides and they

671
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,050
have an ethernet connect here and for

672
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:46,070
for all of them they seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

673
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">connected directly what what happens</font>

674
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:51,410
here these PE waters have to exchange

675
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,930
whenever aside joints there has to be

676
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:56,509
some some exchange mechanism which is

677
00:38:53,930 --> 00:39:01,819
still discussed which one this will be

678
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:03,170
but when it's established those<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides</font>

679
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:08,060
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impression they are connected</font>

680
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:10,490
directly together the whole cloud the

<font color="#CCCCCC">haute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls cloud is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normal regarded</font>

682
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:16,279
as a big switch I pitiful I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

683
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:20,120
see it as a big trunk it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

684
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,860
switch as it does not take part<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

685
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:25,940
switching infrastructure operations as

686
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:27,500
STP of things but at least you have you

687
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,740
can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a switch here as which here</font>

688
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,840
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be switches and it</font>

689
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">seems that those two switches are</font>

690
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,420
connected directly maybe you already get

691
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:41,290
an idea why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very promising or</font>

692
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,130
interesting technology for customers

693
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,860
there's no more distinction between

this but from the security side one can

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,180
state that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a network problem</font>

attack them directly problem here is in

837
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,049
most organizations there are maybe their

in the text point of view hecka box here

873

highly on the functions they perform

878
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:15,210
remember that image we pay less clouds

879
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:17,250
can be regarded as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big switch I do not</font>

agree i prefer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it as big trunk</font>

881
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:23,460
that's the most they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talk layer</font>

00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:33,060
feasible then but they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform</font>

so we'd rather also<font color="#CCCCCC"> make flooding tool</font>

916
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:19,660
and I just flooded I connected to laptop

924
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:48,549
many customers 512 boxes at one side so

925
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,550
the providers have to adjust that and

926
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:55,090
they won't adjust it based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a customer</font>

usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> our operations to provide us is</font>

938
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,070
so

939
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,200
what's so special<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that the first</font>

940
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,310
thing you have to know Julie by devices

when you work with them<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are rather</font>

00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:39,310
stable you you can't really shocked them

943
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:41,540
and you cannot introduce failures by

944

overflowing them or overloading them

945
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:48,710
usually but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is very</font>

to support thousands of customers with

949
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,640
this kind of service and I said there

with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could bring bringing</font>

00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:20,060
hypothesis implementing ethernet wire

959
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,680
one technologies will create a new

960
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:26,299
challenges in terms of network security

961
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,520
you get the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope what can or what</font>

962
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,740
should be done if you want to use such

00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:43,790
if you are used to run a network routers

973
00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:00,129
closely monitor the things passing

975
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:06,140
summary of my presentation and pls is

976
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,470
not just a forwarding technology but

977
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:11,900
serves as a foundation for several

978
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:14,709
advanced services also amongst those

979
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,720
services different VPN technologies

980
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:19,670
under certain conditions these may be

981
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:23,720
attacked or security problems may arise

982
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:26,090
so just perform risk assessment be aware

983
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,609
of the technology and understand it not

984
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">a sin valor risks lie there are new</font>

985
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:32,930
technologies emerging<font color="#E5E5E5"> that provides</font>

986
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:37,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like Ethernet services across</font>

987
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:39,078
mpls clouds and the subsequent merger of

00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,420
lawyer to layer free

989
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:43,190
we'll have broad implications for our

990
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:51,680
understanding of network security our

991
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:58,160
current understanding questions at this

992
00:54:51,680 --> 00:55:10,729
point I'm here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to full two days so if</font>

993
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:12,859
you sorry depends on the advantages it

994
00:55:10,729 --> 00:55:16,368
could provide for my network yes I would

995
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:19,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know of several customers so that</font>

996
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:23,420
would too I gave to stalk at blackhat

997
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:25,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe and after the talk somebody asked</font>

998
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:28,789
the same question as you do you think

999
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:30,558
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> will use this and several hands</font>

1000
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:33,160
in the in the audience race and say hey

1001
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,469
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is cool we will this is interesting</font>

1002
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:39,558
and probably we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will use this some we</font>

1003
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:43,579
will see this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my my hypothesis</font>

1004
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:45,589
so in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> years there will not be not</font>

1005
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:47,690
that distinction between layer to layer

1006
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:50,410
for a BF at the moment it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be to</font>

1007
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,410
disappear

1008
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:05,210
you get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and layer</font>

1009
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:08,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">foodstuff you don't have to you've just</font>

1010
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:14,920

1011
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:19,310
boxers with layer three interfaces sorry

1012
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:24,170
yes it's a kind of kind of approaching

1013
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:27,650
