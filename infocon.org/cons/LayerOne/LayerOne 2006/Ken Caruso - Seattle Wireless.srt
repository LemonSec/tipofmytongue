00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:50,970
like to welcome everybody to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third</font>

2
00:00:45,990 --> 00:01:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">shockingly still going on mayor won our</font>

3
00:00:50,970 --> 00:01:03,660
first at the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> millennia</font>

4
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:07,410
these bunch of wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in Seattle</font>

5
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,289
set up a wireless network and six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

6
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:21,840
later we're gonna see how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all worked</font>

7
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:24,660
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so I was working right ten</font>

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">o'clock in the morning yeah alright so</font>

9
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,149
first off I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the safe thanks to</font>

10
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,009
everyone here at layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> one putting on</font>

11
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,840
these small cons is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work and</font>

12
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys rock and I think everybody</font>

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,050
should give these guys a big round of

14
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,850
applause they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting paid for</font>

15
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,110
this they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this solely for the</font>

16
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,199
benefit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community and I think</font>

17
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's a really important thing so</font>

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,940
who the hell am I well my name is Ken

19
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,350
I'm a member of the shmoo group and I'm

20
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,910
co-founder of the Seattle wireless

21
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,100
project and also an organization called

22
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,080
free networks org whose mission is to

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,928
advocate and promote community wireless

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,630
networks so how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

25
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:04,709
seen Bruce Potter speak before come on

26
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,199
what what's this like two people come on

27
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well anyways he has this big rant</font>

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,899
right that he goes he goes on in the

29
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,240
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his talk about don't</font>

30
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,040
believe anything I say so I really like

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but i'm too lazy to like repeat it</font>

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">all and copy it from them so if you</font>

33
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,530
heard it before just pretend<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just said</font>

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,390
it and here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little picture of him to</font>

35
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:28,260
to remind you so uh i was putting this

36
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,670
slide deck together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was trying to</font>

37
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know I was going over some</font>

38
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,730
notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had about presenting at</font>

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,140
conferences and one of the key points

40
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,230
they have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your slides should</font>

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,410
have photos or pictures that provoke

42
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,790
emotion and so they went on further to

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,290
suggest you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to you know like</font>

44
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,299
getty images or one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these like stock</font>

45
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,950
photography sites but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> shell out</font>

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten bucks for a photo that really</font>

47
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,130
provokes emotions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">these sites and i did a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> search for</font>

49
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,980
community wireless networks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got</font>

50
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,670
this it's like to high school girls you

51
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,069
know checking out the

52
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,780
myspace account or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

53
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,399
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well okay let me you know let me</font>

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,890
dig a little bit deeper<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the root of</font>

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,140
it and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search on the same and</font>

56
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,369
the same site for sticking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the man</font>

57
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,799
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really what this is all</font>

58
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:16,590
about and I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this still not quite the</font>

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,350
emotion I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> for so then I came</font>

60
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,480
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> this image much better i think</font>

61
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know represents what</font>

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,609
I'm the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> across</font>

63
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:29,130
so brief history we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle</font>

64
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,209
wireless in two thousand and it was

65
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you know a bunch of people</font>

66
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,870
meeting in a cafe wireless had just kind

67
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,819
of become prevalent it was starting to

68
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,680
get cheap and buy cheap I mean it was

69
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">like two hundred dollars for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless</font>

70
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,970
card I think maybe 600 bucks for an

71
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,609
access point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're like well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

72
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,680
is a really cool viable technology so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

73
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,720
kind of thought well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we you know</font>

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,790
in a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phyto net esque style</font>

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,109
put up all these wireless access points

76
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,120
around the city instead of just like

77
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,100
giving away free internet access get

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,420
them all to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other so we</font>

79
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,920
thought you know that's that's a cool

80
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,540
idea and we can you know go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,100
see if this works try it out

82
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,780
experimental this technology that was

83
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,280
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you know office and home</font>

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,140
networks and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of push it to</font>

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,890
the limits<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then share with everyone</font>

86
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,869
else what we did so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

87
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,920
interesting right a wireless hotspot and

88
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,239
this is kind of where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were coming</font>

89
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,099
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> like anyone can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this anyone can</font>

90
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,539
go set up a wireless hotspot and really

91
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,310
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day all you're doing</font>

92
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you're extending the telephone</font>

93
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,450
company's local loop I mean it's useful

94
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">right everybody likes free wireless but</font>

95
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,620
it's not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that interesting this is</font>

96
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,690
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more interesting having a</font>

97
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,490
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nodes all inter routing among</font>

98
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,620
each other all talking to each other and

99
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,050
essentially breaking the local loop

100
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,310
network so the local<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop network is</font>

101
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,020
this thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes into your house</font>

102
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,210
right it's either like a pair of<font color="#E5E5E5"> copper</font>

103
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,740
or a cable or something like that and

104
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,229
it's controlled<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the telephone company</font>

105
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,419
and so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they dictate you know</font>

106
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,430
whatever access you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to resources so</font>

107
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,840
if we got all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people together and</font>

108
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,919
we got you know a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> parties</font>

109
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,869
involved and could build<font color="#E5E5E5"> out this</font>

110
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,740
network we could essentially replace

111
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and and kind of like you</font>

112
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,260
know break<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold of the whole like local</font>

113
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,880
loop monopoly and so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

114
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,460
didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> get this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at first and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,080
did a presentation at death content and

116
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,500
I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of questions about like free</font>

117
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,640
Wi-Fi

118
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">and everyone's like wolves free Wi-Fi</font>

119
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,300
gonna put you know comcast out of

120
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,349
business you know what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what's</font>

121
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,090
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all that and I'm</font>

122
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,340
like look this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't really like free</font>

123
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,500
Wi-Fi is not a big deal no one cares

124
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,299
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big deal is the local</font>

125
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,950
loop network and that and so I'm going

126
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more into this but this is really</font>

127
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:32,670
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the the core point behind</font>

128
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,200
seattle wireless so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went out start</font>

129
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,720
doing this we started off<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like some</font>

130
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,820
rap rackmount boxes pci wireless cards

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,260
you know nothin too nothin too fancy

132
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,200
there wasn't really a lot of gear

133
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,090
available out there and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

134
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,560
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using static routes and rip and you</font>

135
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,090
know we built some antennas like

136
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,190
Pringles cans and stuff like that and

137
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,859
you know it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of ghetto really</font>

138
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,880
and then we so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were looking at</font>

139
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,919
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were going to build out this</font>

140
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,190
infrastructure we looked at 802 11 and

141
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,260
802 11 basically has two modes that it

142
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,960
can operate in it can operate in access

143
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,520
point mode or ad hoc mode and they have

144
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,620
more technical terms but for the sake of

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,390
conversation those will do basically an

146
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,100
AP mode you can have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

147
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,870
clients connect to an access point in

148
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,850
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to each other all their</font>

149
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,250
frames get routed through that access

150
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,500
point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad hoc mode they can all talk</font>

151
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,450
to each other directly so for our

152
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,740
purposes that was kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you know</font>

153
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,510
that was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting at</font>

154
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,700
we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have things depending</font>

155
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,770
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-on-one central or multiple</font>

156
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,020
central access points so like in a

157
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,310
picture like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very dumb drawing but</font>

158
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,130
you know in Seattle we have trees right

159
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,570
and so on the left you got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

160
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,010
guys here and they're connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an</font>

161
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">access point they're happy right well</font>

162
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,760
then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> other guy shows up behind the</font>

163
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,560
tree he can't see the access point he

164
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,050
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> party so in ad-hoc</font>

165
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,580
mode he can join the party<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he</font>

166
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,440
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other client directly</font>

167
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,140
and there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no like master in</font>

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,760
the relationship well it introduces a

169
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,950
couple of problems one being that in

170
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ad-hoc mode those are actually that's</font>

171
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,090
not like one big layer to bridge like an

172
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,830
AP is the each each link is its own

173
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,739
individual layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 so each of those</font>

174
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,210
nodes has to route packets or you

175
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,650
basically have to route packets through

176
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,169
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those nodes to actually make the</font>

177
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,810
whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> work then we found out</font>

178
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:15,690
ad-hoc mode sucks so basically like

179
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,729
vendors implement ad-hoc mode or they<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

180
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit or lack of implementation of ad hoc</font>

181
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:22,620
mode Indian cards you know like one car

182
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,710
can talk to it one card can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

183
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">ad-hoc mode</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to another</font>

184
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,770
part of the same vendor but when you

185
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,120
start trying to mix cards together it

186
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,849
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of crazy it doesn't really</font>

187
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">work the Wi-Fi Alliance which is this</font>

188
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,050
organization that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know basically</font>

189
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,000
certifies gear and puts the Wi-Fi logo

190
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,590
logo on it the sale interoperate I don't

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,320
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they test ad hoc mode because</font>

192
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,640
in in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our experiments the</font>

193
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,840
performance has been really poor and

194
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,550
getting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work has been a pain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

195
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,109
the ass so basically at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

196
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,450
day it<font color="#E5E5E5"> exhibits like strange</font>

197
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,580
unpredictable behavior and we're not

198
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,430
really able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as as much as we</font>

199
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,469
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could so then we started</font>

200
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,630
looking at tennis right and I love like

201
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:02,800
the Pringles can is like this is a real

202
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:07,920
funny story let me a link I got to get

203
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my notes here real quick okay so</font>

204
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Pringles can five minutes hit five

205
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,270
minute history so we were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

206
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,510
building antennas and so we bought a

207
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,770
commercial antenna it was a yagi this is

208
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,630
the first time we had actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

209
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,609
passed the packet more than I think like

210
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,050
this we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending packets up to this</font>

211
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,760
thing up on the hill<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was about like</font>

212
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,500
four miles and we were like all<font color="#CCCCCC"> estatic</font>

213
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,670
we're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> whew we might actually be</font>

214
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to like pull this thing off that</font>

215
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,640
we've been talking to like the

216
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,530
newspapers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and television stations about</font>

217
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,299
and all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what do we do</font>

218
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,799
first thing we do we take the thing

219
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,179
apart and we try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> build one let just</font>

220
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,859
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see if we can you know cut</font>

221
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost down from 200 bucks that we</font>

222
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,640
paid for it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe like 50 bucks so</font>

223
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,620
while we're doing this we're taking it

224
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,720
apart we're putting all the specs up on

225
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,030
the internet and this kid comes along

226
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,920
and he basically manages to stuff it

227
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,170
into a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cans thus dude andrew</font>

228
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">hackman he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 15 years old at the</font>

229
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,410
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think and he lived down in oregon</font>

230
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,510
and so he basically shrinks the thing

231
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,800
down sticks in a Pringles can stink

232
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,250
sitting up here sticks it in a purely in

233
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,750
cans takes it in a cash you can and you

234
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,040
know we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well cool you know</font>

235
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's kind of cool it's a clever hack</font>

236
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,819
well little did we know like what chaos

237
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,590
would ensue like the Pringles can

238
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,390
becomes you know like the new black and

239
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:16,480
everyone starts building<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know</font>

240
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,370
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and so it was interesting</font>

241
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,780
we used it a lot as a tool to like get

242
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,250
people involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless you know</font>

243
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,810
because people are like people wanted to

244
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">build Pringles cams antennas so we're</font>

245
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">like yeah we'll show you how to build</font>

246
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,550
Pringles cans antennas if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

247
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,070
come and listen to us ran about the

248
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,430
Seattle wireless thing for a while and

249
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:36,220
then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> came out with a cantenna for</font>

250
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">50 bucks we're like you know what the</font>

251
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,810
fuck

252
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,120
so six years later<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's changed a lots</font>

253
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,469
changed we've gotten a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,700
mature you know we're no longer running

255
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,310
around on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roofs of Seattle with</font>

256
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,810
soggy Pringles cans and we're starting

257
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more professional here we don't</font>

258
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,979
use you know rackmount boxes anymore we

259
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,110
use so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris boxes or generally we use</font>

260
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,030
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris boxes it's embedded PC platform</font>

261
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,910
that's designed by this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> down in</font>

262
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,939
California runs linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> openbsd net bsd</font>

263
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">freebsd whatever we also use waterproof</font>

264
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,570
enclosures now you know keep stuff dry

265
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">ad-hoc mode well ad-hoc mode hasn't</font>

266
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,510
really worked out so well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

267
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,100
our links what we're actually doing is

268
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,080
we're using client infrastructure mode

269
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,580
so we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traditional you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

270
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,960
the traditional technology that you guys

271
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,030
are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to connect to the access</font>

272
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,350
point which means in situations where we

273
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,180
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have multiple links we need to</font>

274
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,310
get multiple radios we need to each node

275
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,819
has to have a client node in an access

276
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,339
point node for routing we're using an

277
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,760
open source well no consorte simplement

278
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,740
ation of olsr olsr is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimized</font>

279
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,560
link state routing protocol it's an RFC

280
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,660
its standard and basically it's designed

281
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,609
to it's a mesh routing protocol so it's

282
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,219
designed to like take a bunch of boxes

283
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,839
you can turn them on they'll all connect

284
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,250
to each other and figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the r you</font>

285
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,410
know figure out the routing all on their

286
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,480
own it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

287
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,650
and you know back in the day when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

288
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,060
were trying when we were doing static

289
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,110
routes and rip part of the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

290
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,699
did that was because none of the

291
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,100
existing routing protocols at the time

292
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,230
like ospf and these types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things were</font>

293
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,400
really designed number one they weren't

294
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,580
designed for wireless but number two

295
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,319
they're all designed in a they're all

296
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed with the fact that like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

297
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,980
you have control over all the routers

298
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,180
and like our whole thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

299
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to control them all we want</font>

300
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,670
everyone to control their own router so

301
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,890
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to have a network</font>

302
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">where someone can come up turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

303
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,640
box connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it like if all you guys</font>

304
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">fly up to seattle tomorrow bring your</font>

305
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,280
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soakers boxes down and turn</font>

306
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,540
them on you should be able to join this

307
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,189
thing participate and you know we

308
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,360
shouldn't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange any</font>

309
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,610
information with you you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be</font>

310
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to connect so technologies like</font>

311
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,480
olsr allow us to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a bunch</font>

312
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out there we chose this one in</font>

313
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,200
particular for one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing because it's</font>

314
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,680
portable it runs on<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS X it runs on</font>

315
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,380
Windows it runs on linux net bsd it's

316
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,089
also in mesh routing there's two there's

317
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,620
generally two types of protocols there's

318
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,390
proactive and

319
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,550
active mesh routing protocols so

320
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,530
basically you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come up as a box</font>

321
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this network you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send packets</font>

322
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,670
somewhere a route needs to be

323
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">established well in olsr</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

324
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,060
proactively always building the routing

325
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,800
table which means every<font color="#E5E5E5"> node is</font>

326
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,089
receiving routing updates at certain

327
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,979
intervals so when you come up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

328
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,720
say hey I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet to you</font>

329
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,730
know Joe it's like oh I know where Joe

330
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,310
is Joe's over here whereas some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

331
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,160
other mesh routing protocols like aodv

332
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,359
is one that comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind it's reactive</font>

333
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,400
so when you come up onto the network

334
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
you're like hey I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Joe</font>

335
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,550
the nodes send out like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

336
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,260
requests like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey where's Joe where's</font>

337
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,240
Joe where's Jo Jo's over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

338
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,510
this tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work better for our</font>

339
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,730
purposes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we chose it here</font>

340
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that looks crappy huh this is a network</font>

341
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,560
map that we generated olsr has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in</font>

342
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,010
that basically will take all of the

343
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,469
topology information and create sgv SVG

344
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:47,050
images so this was kind of a network map

345
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,360
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I think maybe three</font>

346
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,449
or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months ago just to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of give</font>

347
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you an idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it looks like so</font>

348
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,590
will it<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale honestly you know we don't</font>

349
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we're um we're pretty small right</font>

350
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,850
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been pretty small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a while</font>

351
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,430
but in Germany there's a there's an

352
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,040
experimental olsr network that has over

353
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,739
100 nodes and it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

354
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately you know it's hard to say</font>

355
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,010
whether or not I'll scale because it's

356
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,900
still unproven technology but the thing

357
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,520
is is that it's open technology it's a

358
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,530
standard and so we kind of feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

359
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's our need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to support it and make it</font>

360
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,589
better if it doesn't scale now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

361
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,840
we do to improve it you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

362
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,080
what changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to happen to actually</font>

363
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,880
make that work so what about the network

364
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,190
well right now the network is about 35

365
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,980
nodes and they're not all interconnected

366
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,810
we have a very we have maybe like five

367
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,800
interconnected nodes at the moment a lot

368
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">of we have a lot of nodes that are</font>

369
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,740
islands where basically they're just

370
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,450
nodes with internet access waiting for

371
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,580
another node to pop up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and connect to it</font>

372
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,020
in some cases we tunnel them into the

373
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,580
backbone<font color="#CCCCCC"> of entering of</font>

374
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,730
internet-connected note<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry of</font>

375
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,380
wirelessly connected nodes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you</font>

376
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,170
know that's that's basically where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

377
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,939
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> stands today and then we've also</font>

378
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,339
gotten a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of high-profile nodes</font>

379
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:01,330
like this is a TV tower up on Capitol

380
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,770
Hill and a low-power FM station came to

381
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,180
us a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago and was like hey</font>

382
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,069
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we really like your project</font>

383
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,800
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you a spot on this</font>

384
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,350
tower there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one catch it costs</font>

385
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,990
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,000 bucks to have somebody climb</font>

386
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,970
up the tower and mount your gear so like

387
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,250
wow in the whole time we've been running

388
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,750
this project we've never once asked for

389
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,279
money from anybody never really done

390
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,930
like any fundraising everything's been

391
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,850
out of pocket so we're like you know

392
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,130
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really really good opportunity</font>

393
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think it you know it might just be</font>

394
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,520
time to try and actually raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

395
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,959
money because you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> put six years</font>

396
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my life into this and a lot of money</font>

397
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">into it I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go pay 2 grand</font>

398
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,940
you know to have some guy climb up the

399
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,149
tower so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a fund</font>

400
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,160
raiser and believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or not like with</font>

401
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,110
no advertising really just putting like

402
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,850
a little logo on the site<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

403
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,950
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little logo on my weblog and a</font>

404
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,620
few other places and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font>

405
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,120
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise two thousand dollars to get to</font>

406
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,120
pay the guy to climb up<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing and</font>

407
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,600
mount mount antenna up there really

408
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">really cool well about a month later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

409
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,270
get an email from the person with a

410
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,860
low-power FM transmitter they're like

411
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,899
yeah I guess what the FCC will renew our

412
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,450
license so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to have that</font>

413
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,760
space anymore it's like I oh dude bummer

414
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,730
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flipside is that now we're</font>

415
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,950
actually working with a another another

416
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,029
company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> owns space on another tower</font>

417
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,800
right next to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

418
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:19,270
going to probably end up getting their

419
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,010
kind of sympathetic to the cause they

420
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,079
feel for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're actually going to</font>

421
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,630
end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a spot on another tower</font>

422
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,800
much higher so but that's kind of like

423
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,420
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of things that</font>

424
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,390
we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the kind of stuff we're</font>

425
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,040
trying to do and is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> progress well in</font>

426
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,730
six years you know actually don't let's

427
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">go back to this so another funny story</font>

428
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,640
so so we got this whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> done right</font>

429
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,020
you know we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up there and and</font>

430
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">Glenn Fleischmann this guy who's a</font>

431
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,540
reporter up in Seattle writes for the

432
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:49,510
Seattle time so it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of y ou</font>

433
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,770
coverage on Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> writes this article</font>

434
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the resurgence and community</font>

435
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,089
wireless networks and so it makes it on

436
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new york</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times you know there's a</font>

437
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,100
picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Matson in front of</font>

438
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,480
this tower and and so in the article

439
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,770
goes on and on about all these different

440
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,990
community wireless groups and what

441
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,550
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and so we get the article</font>

442
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">or like all stoked and we start reading</font>

443
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,439
it and basically like what they wrote

444
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,089
was like a so it's taken six years but

445
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,630
Seattle Wireless has raised two thousand

446
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:19,610
dollars and put a note on a tower

447
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:21,500
I think sweet so is this progress well

448
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,480
the network has not progressed as much

449
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,860
as we would like but there's a lot of

450
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,390
complications there you know it's hard

451
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people organized there's a lot of</font>

452
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,150
buildings there's a lot of trees

453
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,829
hopefully there's some stuff coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

454
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,959
the pike that might fix that but

455
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately I think the impact that we've</font>

456
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,090
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> overall has been extremely valuable</font>

457
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,530
so one of the things that a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

458
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,030
people have been working on is this book

459
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,589
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless network and what</font>

460
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,600
wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking in the developing</font>

461
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,010
world and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a guide for</font>

462
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,720
building standards-based wireless

463
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,120
networks you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can download the book for</font>

464
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">free in PDF format or you can buy it for</font>

465
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,720
a whopping price of nine dollars and

466
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">sixty-two cents online and it's</font>

467
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically based off of all the work that</font>

468
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">us and a lot of other community wireless</font>

469
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,830
networks group wireless network groups

470
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,270
have done and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being used in</font>

471
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,620
other places around the world where

472
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,689
people don't have like existing

473
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,890
telecommunications infrastructure or you

474
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:08,900
know where if they did it would be

475
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">prohibitively expensive so like you know</font>

476
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,650
places where they they get a V satlink

477
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,150
and they have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe like 30</font>

478
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,130
miles of area that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

479
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">coverage to people with their taking the</font>

480
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,550
work that we've done and they're

481
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,170
building maintainable infrastructure

482
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,050
they're not you know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not getting</font>

483
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,939
stuff from like Cisco or troppo stats

484
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,470
kind of like a closed<font color="#E5E5E5"> box solution their</font>

485
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:29,630
number one learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> about networking</font>

486
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,820
number two building something that's

487
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,470
open standards-based I think that's very

488
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,270
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean at the end of the</font>

489
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,620
day screw the network you know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

490
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,510
make more stuff like that happen around

491
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:42,800
the world I'm half so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does work ghana</font>

492
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,150
belgrade and hungry or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> places that</font>

493
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,320
come to mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was at a conference a</font>

494
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,940
couple of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago the community</font>

495
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,740
wireless summit and I got to meet people

496
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">from all three of these networks and</font>

497
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,600
like in Belgrade they have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

498
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,580
like a 35 node interconnected network

499
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,860
throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city and they have 400</font>

500
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,419
people on it 400 people that's like

501
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,669
pretty amazing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's probably</font>

502
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,860
one of the like largest community

503
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,230
wireless successes that I've heard of

504
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,149
and you know when he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like telling me</font>

505
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,620
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he was like so I</font>

506
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,540
go to see this guy talk and like we've

507
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,760
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> met before in his like first word</font>

508
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,649
was uh so you know first off I'd like to

509
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not about</font>

510
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,590
internet access it's about building a

511
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,570
local network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I like you know shed</font>

512
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,129
like a little geeky tier because I mean

513
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,810
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to like get that message to</font>

514
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,880
people for years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like here comes</font>

515
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">this guy you know out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nowhere and we</font>

516
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,570
see eye to eye it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty cool</font>

517
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,970
ways there's tons more of these projects

518
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,950
going on and I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's you know</font>

519
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,629
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all like proof that the stuff</font>

520
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,019
that we've been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is valuable</font>

521
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:41,928
and it is feasible so what's the next

522
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:43,250
big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

523
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,690
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but there's a couple things</font>

524
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,970
that I see happening in the community

525
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:50,000
wireless world that I think or you know

526
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially have some impact and could</font>

527
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,850
change things quite a bit one is this

528
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:57,350
crazy crackhead idea called OPN that a

529
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,269
friend of mine came up with and so

530
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically if you've heard the song OPP</font>

531
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:04,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">will OPN is other people's networks so</font>

532
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure everyone in this room at some</font>

533
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:08,120
point has used the linksys<font color="#CCCCCC"> community</font>

534
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">network yes whether or not you like to</font>

535
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">admit it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have they provide a great</font>

536
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,620
service one of the most successful

537
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,929
projects honestly so if you're to look

538
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,489
at this picture all those red circles

539
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:22,009
are you know like let's say they're

540
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,600
Seattle wireless well all those blue

541
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:26,299
circles are the linksys<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

542
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so the linksys community network</font>

543
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,340
basically provides like a free layer to

544
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,470
bridge right so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can like overlay</font>

545
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,908
all of our nodes on top of the linksys

546
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,649
community network or whatever community

547
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:38,929
no the default community network the

548
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:41,830
netgear community network any of them

549
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:44,570
then you know we can greatly expand the

550
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network and we can may you know it's</font>

551
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,580
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know crackhead idea but so</font>

552
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:51,740
how does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work well part of the</font>

553
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,480
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you know we talked</font>

554
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,159
earlier about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ap client mode</font>

555
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,259
thing you know one device can either be

556
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,470
an AP or client and it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only be a</font>

557
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:02,299
client to one network at a time so 802

558
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,370
11 has this really cool feature in it

559
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">about with called power saving so</font>

560
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,449
basically you know as an 802 11 card you

561
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,949
can say hey access point I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

562
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,070
to sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and try and save some power</font>

563
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Q up some frames for me so the idea is</font>

564
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,899
that basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our nodes would</font>

565
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,580
you know be using this and it be clients

566
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:21,350
of the linksys<font color="#CCCCCC"> community network and</font>

567
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,149
they'd be like hey linksys number 1 i'm

568
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to sleep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now queue up my</font>

569
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:26,029
frames hey links<font color="#E5E5E5"> this number to you know</font>

570
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,189
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> my frames</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to go to</font>

571
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:29,990
sleep<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and just basically go you know</font>

572
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,789
go back and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep track of of</font>

573
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,350
which nodes are interconnected through

574
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:37,519
which linksys community network nodes

575
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:39,769
crazy idea but it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> work because now</font>

576
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,539
with like mad wife-ing which is the new

577
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,779
code base for the mad Wi-Fi driver it's

578
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,999
a

579
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:46,219
driver for the atheros wireless cards

580
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:48,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">supports some pretty cool features one</font>

581
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:49,789
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a radio can act as an AP and a</font>

582
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:51,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">client at the same time so like when you</font>

583
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">fire this thing up you actually get</font>

584
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:56,809
virtual interfaces and you have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

585
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:58,070
know client interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap interface you</font>

586
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:01,190
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is this might actually</font>

587
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,749
OPN might work so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have if</font>

588
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,950
anybody here has any interest in working

589
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:05,809
on that or if you're a software

590
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,029
developer and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking at a</font>

591
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,049
couple and I see here and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

592
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:11,269
write and you want to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

593
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:14,869
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this let me know we're actively</font>

594
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:16,249
looking for people to work on this this

595
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:19,699
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> part this thing right here is a</font>

596
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:22,820
card made by ubiquiti networks and this

597
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,649
card is a it's based on a theory on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

598
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,889
atheros chipset<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is used a lot in</font>

599
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:31,339
Wi-Fi cards but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> operates in 900</font>

600
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:32,718
megahertz spectrum 900 megahertz can

601
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:36,529
actually like go through buildings you

602
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:38,149
know 2.4 gigahertz sucks it doesn't it's

603
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,739
just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very dependent on</font>

604
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:41,029
line of sight you have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

605
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:42,049
the thing that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to it</font>

606
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:46,009
doesn't go through trees or buildings

607
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:47,719
very well 900 megahertz does so problem

608
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:49,219
is the 900 megahertz spectrum is really

609
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:50,989
small and so there's some question as to

610
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:52,999
like whether or not you know a lot of

611
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:55,219
cards in the same area will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

612
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:56,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 900 megahertz but they're also this</font>

613
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:57,950
is abut this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like you</font>

614
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,839
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are other things</font>

615
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,179
coming down the pike and hopefully we'll

616
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,279
have some alternatives to 2.4 the FCC is

617
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:06,469
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've heard talks a</font>

618
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,830
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> licensed or opening up some</font>

619
00:22:06,469 --> 00:22:11,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff in like 700 megahertz and so you</font>

620
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,678
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is there's a possibility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

621
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:14,539
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to have some RF</font>

622
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,589
technology that isn't dependent on line

623
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:17,989
of sight which i think will help

624
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:19,489
community wireless networks a lot we're

625
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:20,960
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get better portal so has</font>

626
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:23,269
anybody everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> here knows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what a</font>

627
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,799
captive portal is what no cat off is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

628
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:27,589
know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you connect to a wireless</font>

629
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,450
network and the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send out</font>

630
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:31,549
an HTTP request it redirects you to

631
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,169
portal page you know you either put in

632
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,149
your credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card number or you agree to</font>

633
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,499
the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement what whatever</font>

634
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:39,199
depending on the network you know you do

635
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:41,389
a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things so when we first</font>

636
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">started this the guys in sebastopol</font>

637
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:43,908
wrote note<font color="#CCCCCC"> cap because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

638
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:45,049
problems that we had with community

639
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:46,369
networks is that we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

640
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:47,869
tell people you know hey this is the

641
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:50,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">this network that you're connecting to</font>

642
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:52,488
<font color="#CCCCCC">is provided by people you know in their</font>

643
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,169
spare time it's a volunteer effort and

644
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:55,430
you know if you have any problems you

645
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,870
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact them or if you</font>

646
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,340
want to help out you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's how you</font>

647
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,600
get in touch with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> also there's some</font>

648
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,669
legal concerns so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

649
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,530
to say hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do something</font>

650
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">illegal on here you've accepted the user</font>

651
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:08,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreement it's not it's not our fault</font>

652
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're not liable so that's cool serves a</font>

653
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,470
purpose but now there's this new thing

654
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:17,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">called Wi-Fi dog which is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spying no</font>

655
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:19,040
cat no cat Wi-Fi dog so Wi-Fi dog is

656
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,960
this new captive<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source captive</font>

657
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,310
portal and it's kind of focused a little

658
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
bit differently it's not I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

659
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:27,139
all the authentication stuff but it's

660
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,970
focused on aggregating information about

661
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,800
the area that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're in and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> displaying</font>

662
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,090
it on the portal page so here's like a

663
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,879
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshot and this is like</font>

664
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:37,610
totally all web you know 20 shit but

665
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically like Wi-Fi dog can take in for</font>

666
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,760
like in Wi-Fi dog when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

667
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">access points you can put in the geo</font>

668
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">coordinates of the AP and so it knows</font>

669
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,370
where the AP is it has like meta

670
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,860
information about the AP it can then

671
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,169
aggregate information like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flickr you</font>

672
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,810
can tag you know photos with location or

673
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,280
coordinates RSS feeds from blogs can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

674
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,320
tagged<font color="#E5E5E5"> with look you know geo</font>

675
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,790
coordinates<font color="#E5E5E5"> or and that type of meta</font>

676
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,830
information so when you go connect to an

677
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,480
AP you can get this page and you can say

678
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,710
hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the guy down the</font>

679
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,240
street took these pictures are you know

680
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,730
like here's an RSS feed from all the

681
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,810
like bloggers in the area and you can

682
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,340
aggregate a lot of really cool

683
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">information I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be</font>

684
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,060
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big deal for community networks</font>

685
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,189
because it is like it puts more of the

686
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,659
emphasis on community it's not you're

687
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,770
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just providing you know an internet</font>

688
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,020
connection you're providing a

689
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,060
communications for immuno cafes are

690
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,830
suffering from this I don't want say

691
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,149
suffering but like in Seattle we have

692
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,100
like you know cafes that are like

693
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,600
shutting down their Wi-Fi at certain

694
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,889
times the day because people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just come</font>

695
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,169
in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sit around and you</font>

696
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,700
know I've heard cafe owners say like you

697
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,230
know this Wi-Fi thing kind of sucks like

698
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,490
people just come<font color="#E5E5E5"> into our cafe and they</font>

699
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,410
sit there they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to anybody</font>

700
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,690
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's kind of like an</font>

701
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,070
anti-social thing so hopefully things

702
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,270
like that will change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll</font>

703
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,159
help kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like build the community</font>

704
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">around that and it's interesting because</font>

705
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,180
this is all a result of like the

706
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,590
technology getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into like the hands</font>

707
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,720
of like you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font>

708
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bloggers and people that are kind of</font>

709
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,960
more into the art scene and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

710
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,970
are like used to communicating unlike

711
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,560
the geeks who you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they're not</font>

712
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">really used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicating as much in</font>

713
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,470
a social environment so the tools are

714
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,990
finally getting mature enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

715
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,700
people with really cool ideas can start

716
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,930
using this you know to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefit and</font>

717
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,670
this is a

718
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,720
you know when I when when we first

719
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">started this people would always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

720
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">well you know why the hell are you doing</font>

721
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,910
this what's the point and I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

722
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,640
yeah there's a quote i think it's

723
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,470
william gibson it's a the the street

724
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,990
finds uses for technology that the

725
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,220
inventors never expected or something

726
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,530
like that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm sure somebody</font>

727
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,640
here knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> it verbatim but that was kind</font>

728
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,629
of my response is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I don't</font>

729
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what's going to happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

730
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,210
thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we're doing it</font>

731
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,500
because i'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that somebody's</font>

732
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do something really fucking</font>

733
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,340
cool and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of feel like it's</font>

734
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of feel like it's my</font>

735
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,580
mission to enable that I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

736
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,190
what it is but I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know I</font>

737
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,409
know it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen so then there's this</font>

738
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,210
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> muni wireless so</font>

739
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,160
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless has been going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

740
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,620
a long time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font>

741
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,990
from like cities municipalities counties

742
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,489
have started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what saw was going</font>

743
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,110
on there like huh that's cool so you can

744
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,150
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own network well you know</font>

745
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,229
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seattle comcast really pissed</font>

746
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,760
off Seattle because they like

747
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,260
over-promised and<font color="#E5E5E5"> under-delivered on</font>

748
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,550
providing internet access and cable

749
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,000
access and this has happened all over

750
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:09,320
the country so municipalities are was

751
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,970
quote up here when a parking ticket is

752
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,000
not enough so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that in a</font>

753
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,040
second but basically they're starting to

754
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,410
build their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own wireless networks to do</font>

755
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,970
a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is to you know do</font>

756
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,350
stuff like support meter maids so like

757
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,390
meter maids walk around with wireless

758
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,310
wireless devices for reading parking

759
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,290
meters reading wadding water meters

760
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,300
police officers using it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get access</font>

761
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:31,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know like criminal information or</font>

762
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,090
whatever whatever they need in the flip

763
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,870
side of that is that since they're

764
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,699
building out all this infrastructure

765
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,100
they can architect it in such a way that

766
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,960
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also provide Internet access to</font>

767
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,969
people that live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in those communities so</font>

768
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,280
a lot of like a lot of municipalities

769
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,720
are going around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and doing this and this</font>

770
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,120
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing you know</font>

771
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,680
like it's kind of what happened though

772
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,790
like the municipalities couldn't really

773
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,170
work with community wireless because

774
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,300
we're a bunch of like you know geeks and

775
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,350
it's just not the synergy wasn't there

776
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,629
but they've gone off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've done it</font>

777
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">on their own which i think is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

778
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,050
and it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very important and</font>

779
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to get a little bit a little</font>

780
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,620
bit more later into why this is really

781
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,360
important but just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an idea</font>

782
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,830
of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with meeting wireless</font>

783
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,479
right now there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a total of 186</font>

784
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,800
active<font color="#E5E5E5"> many wireless projects so that</font>

785
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,300
includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been deployed</font>

786
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones that are you know in the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

787
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,320
deployment<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RFP so like and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

788
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,790
just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past two years so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

789
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,439
like a really serious thing like people

790
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,490
are like cities are pouring like

791
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,070
millions of dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

792
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,630
and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really timing there's like</font>

793
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Francisco google thing like</font>

794
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,420
that's that's kind of like a mini

795
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,159
wireless project but these are like

796
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,720
actual like projects where they're

797
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,610
building out network infrastructure that

798
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,640
the city is using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the people are</font>

799
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:41,178
using as well so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my beef</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

800
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,559
meeting wireless Meatwad you know come

801
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:43,940
on you guys are supposed to laugh that's

802
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole point supposed to invoke</font>

803
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:50,720
emotion so I was at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I've this</font>

804
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,820
conference couple weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these</font>

805
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,120
guys in Corpus Christi are building out

806
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,760
this huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> Muni wireless network and one</font>

807
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the slides that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy showed said</font>

808
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,480
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the infrastructure they</font>

809
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,169
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using is totally secure infinitely</font>

810
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,610
scalable well you know if there's one

811
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,080
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

812
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:12,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">improvement is that you know anything</font>

813
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,270
wireless is totally not secure so

814
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,380
there's so many wireless networks are

815
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,300
going out and they're like putting a

816
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,760
bunch of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these projects and</font>

817
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,710
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they buying well they're not</font>

818
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying open standard based equipment</font>

819
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,559
they're buying proprietary equipment so

820
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,120
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out and they're buying</font>

821
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,428
like these mesh networking solutions

822
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,439
that speak 802 11 on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edge to all the</font>

823
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:32,210
end users but on the back end they speak

824
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,250
some proprietary routing algorithm they

825
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,040
make tweaks to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wireless side</font>

826
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,690
of things and all in all I don't really

827
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a win-win</font>

828
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,890
situation because on one side we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

829
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">like people and community wireless and</font>

830
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,640
people working on stuff like olsr and

831
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,649
they're trying to make open you know

832
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,179
standards-based equipment that works and

833
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,710
then you have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people like the</font>

834
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:54,920
municipalities who are nonprofit

835
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,150
organizations essentially and and they

836
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,920
want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like they're trying to</font>

837
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">make it work as well and there's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

838
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,309
synergy there that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font>

839
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,590
but instead you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're going out</font>

840
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:04,820
and they're buying gear that probably

841
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,320
won't talk to other gear and they're

842
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,909
buying gear from companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

843
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">be around in you know five years so</font>

844
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,510
they're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like they're getting</font>

845
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,428
locked in and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see more</font>

846
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,870
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need the</font>

847
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:17,120
wireless networks and have the money

848
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,949
supporting the smart people that can

849
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,820
write like the opens the open

850
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">standards-based software to support it</font>

851
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you know it's one of those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

852
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">like do we really need to like learn all</font>

853
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,340
these lessons over and over again like

854
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,379
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many times have we gone through this</font>

855
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,178
like cycle of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh someone comes out</font>

856
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,820
with a totally secure infinitely

857
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:36,320
scalable proprietary solution find out

858
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,879
that's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it doesn't it doesn't</font>

859
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,309
work or you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long run it</font>

860
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,110
doesn't work whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's open if</font>

861
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,760
it's open standards-based or<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

862
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,409
then you know people can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually extend</font>

863
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,000
it and fix the problems when it happens

864
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,890
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not kind of like locked into</font>

865
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,179
you know walked into this especially in

866
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,150
like Wireless where companies kind of

867
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:54,530
come and go fairly quickly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's my</font>

868
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,820
main beef with me any wireless so if

869
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,610
there's anybody here that's involved

870
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,020
with meeting wireless I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

871
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,129
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's awesome it makes me</font>

872
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are out there doing</font>

873
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">this it's very very important but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

874
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,730
kind of wish it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was being done a little</font>

875
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,050
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> differently so why should</font>

876
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">you care about all this why should you</font>

877
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,530
care about community wireless networks

878
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,240
why should you care about meeting

879
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:17,600
wireless networks what's what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

880
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,390
effing deal right so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote</font>

881
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,189
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a David Eisenberg hobbyist</font>

882
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,410
collecting Pez dispensers could develop

883
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,450
the idea to become ebay a couple

884
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,850
Stanford students could start Google and

885
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,020
build a better search engine two guys in

886
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,610
Europe could assemble handful

887
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,870
programmers and invent skype and

888
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,860
threaten the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trillion dollar annual</font>

889

<font color="#E5E5E5">global tel tel economy so that happens</font>

890
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can happen for a reason it can</font>

891
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,949
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> for because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is open</font>

892
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,120
and because you know there's all these

893
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">principles that kind of feel the</font>

894
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,909
internet well a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is</font>

895
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,189
threatened right now and there's a lot

896
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,660
of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could change that so</font>

897
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,250
there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole concept of net</font>

898
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,070
neutrality does a bit has anybody here

899
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:57,919
ever heard of the term net neutrality

900
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:00,050
yes no<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so basically the concept of</font>

901
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,360
net neutrality is this that you know as

902
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:05,059
a as a provider or as anyone routing

903
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,320
bits you treat all bits equal all bits

904
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:07,790
are the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't care what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

905
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,559
are basically as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

906
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,120
illegal and they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurting the</font>

907
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,110
network you pass a bit back and forth

908
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,909
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how most of our internet</font>

909
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,168
connections work and it's part of like

910
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,910
this common carriage thing that has

911
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:19,730
existed you know before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet for</font>

912
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:22,880
railroads and for major you know major

913
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:25,220
critical paths for the economy and so

914
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,960
the providers must remain neutral and

915
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,400
not filtered<font color="#CCCCCC"> not filter content not</font>

916
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,809
filtered bits you know like this stuff

917
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,010
with like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cable company saying hey you</font>

918
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we're not going to pass your VoIP</font>

919
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:35,000
traffic unless you spend you know an

920
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,550
extra 10 bucks a month that is not

921
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,440
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> network neutral but the</font>

922
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,149
Internet has long operated on this

923
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,650
principle and it's not enforced by any

924
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,260
law or you know any<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulation that's</font>

925
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of the way it's been so what</font>

926
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,200
so now in August there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a</font>

927
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,269
deregulation

928
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,590
on telephone lines where you know

929
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:54,690
currently if you get a if you get a

930
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">telephone line into your house that your</font>

931
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,130
local telephone company<font color="#E5E5E5"> your incumbent</font>

932
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,529
lek essentially is required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer</font>

933
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,299
access to that line so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a DSL</font>

934
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:06,539
connection from speakeasy or your local

935
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:08,190
ISP or whatever well come in August they

936
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,269
don't have to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore now</font>

937
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,710
they're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just going to shut</font>

938
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:11,639
it off they might start you know but

939
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,730
they're eventually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

940
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:17,939
muscling the smaller ISPs out of out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

941
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the business and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller ISPs are</font>

942
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,570
you know who basically have been kind of

943
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:23,700
innovating consumer internet access for

944
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the you know since it's existed the</font>

945
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,940
telco who brought you dial up first it

946
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,529
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telephone company how long</font>

947
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,820
did it take for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the telephone company to</font>

948
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:32,519
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> you dial up how long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did you know</font>

949
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">there these guys are not the smaller</font>

950
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys are the innovators not the larger</font>

951
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,980
guys and then in the brand x case the

952
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,529
brand x cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> this play the situation</font>

953
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,690
where a company isp and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Santa Monica</font>

954
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:44,279
basically was challenging the cable

955
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,690
company because right now the cable

956
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,700
company doesn't have to provide access

957
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,190
to their lines for other ISPs you know

958
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,600
speakeasy or you know quest or whoever

959
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,880
can't deliver you an internet connection

960
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,100
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your cable connection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only the cable</font>

961
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,559
company can so that's always that's

962
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">always existed but now in August with</font>

963
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,620
the telephone lines it's going to

964
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically become the same thing so what</font>

965
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,518
happens well you basically have a

966
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:08,070
duopoly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on cus on consumer internet</font>

967
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,990
access so theoretically you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the</font>

968
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">next year when you go to get an internet</font>

969
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,590
connection you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have two choices we</font>

970
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,899
could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the telco or the cable</font>

971
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:19,199
company no independent ist not a good

972
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:20,969
situation so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so what does the</font>

973
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,799
cable company do well they<font color="#CCCCCC"> stole cable</font>

974
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,779
for a long time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they want</font>

975
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be able to basically sell value-added</font>

976
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:29,309
services so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential threats</font>

977
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,840
of this is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet consumer</font>

978
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:33,389
internet access will basically become

979
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,490
like cable television so basic cable oh

980
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:37,408

this is like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> network neutrality</font>

1025
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:09,060
kind of comes into play because they're

1026
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,370
basically talking about in this like

1027
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,570
tiered cable television style internet

1028

1033
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,490
slow well that's because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1034
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the streaming media package you</font>

1035
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,819
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to upgrade to get faster</font>

1036
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,830
streaming media and they'll basically be

1037
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,960
rate limiting you know certain bits

1038
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,930
because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to charge you more</font>

1039
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,730
money for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it well that's a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

me to poop on verizon CEO ivan

1041
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,860
seidenberg says that web applications

1042
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,660
need to share the cost of broadband

1043
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,440
services already paid for<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1044
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,750
consumers we need to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the pipe</font>

1045
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so share the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means so</font>

1046
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:57,180
that if you charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google money to send</font>

1047
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,320
bits to me then that's going to offset

1048
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost so you guys are going to charge</font>

1049
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,590
me less for the internet connection

1050
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:05,609
right probably not so one other argument

1051
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,900
that I've heard you know and this is

1052
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people think of</font>

1053
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this as like the sky is following you</font>

1054
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,550
know the Internet is going to die a lot

1055
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,990
it in then you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

1056
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">argument that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet routes around</font>

1057
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,509
censorship right well building wireless

1058
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,339
networks is a way

1059
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,720
route around that that's and I think

1060
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,030
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the reason why a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1061
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,439
this stuff is happening now also a lot

1062
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,940
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know screw</font>

1063
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cable company if they give me as</font>

1064
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,180
long as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a single you know port</font>

1065
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,310
that i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send packets over i can</font>

1066
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,100
tunnel whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell I want over it</font>

1067
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,509
this is true you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do that but at</font>

1068
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,160
the end of the day when you get your

1069
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,500
user agreement from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp if you do</font>

1070
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,089
that then you become a QB you basically

1071
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,710
become a cable thief right now you're no

1072
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:43,240
different than the guy who like goes

1073
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,160
into the junction box in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your apartment</font>

1074
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,959
building and wires up his own free cable

1075
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,310
just because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send some</font>

1076
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,730
packets back and forth I don't really

1077
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's fair so wireless is an</font>

1078
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">alternative to this alternative local</font>

1079
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,900
loop networks full right around this so

1080
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,430
you're like I said this is kind of like

1081
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,930
I think part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless thing as a</font>

1082
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,609
result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this people feel a lot of</font>

1083
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,440
frustration with the things that are

1084
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in telecom industry and so</font>

1085
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why I like municipalities and you</font>

1086
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,760
know groups of geeks are going out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1087
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,140
trying to build other networks because

1088
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,930
they don't they don't like what's

1089
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,700
happening and in you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> event</font>

1090
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,279
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can create like a ubiquitous</font>

1091
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,569
mesh wireless network then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1092
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,460
be a lot more competitive because then

1093
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,810
at that point any<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP can connect up to</font>

1094
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,310
this network and provide an internet

1095
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,230
connection any VoIP provider can you

1096
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:25,330
know connect up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide a dial tone</font>

1097
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,620
and so it's going to breed competition

1098
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,029
it's going to breed innovation and

1099
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,859
that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how the Internet's</font>

1100
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:32,170
worked and so from the consumer

1101
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,060
standpoint this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1102
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">really this is really a big threat and</font>

1103
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part it won't</font>

1104
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:39,130
affect you know like us you know yeah if

1105
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,870
you have a t1 at your house you don't

1106
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to worry about this but the people</font>

1107
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:44,200
that are you know just starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1108
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:46,150
the internet now are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1109
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,040
open to the same innovations and they're

1110
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to see it the same way that we</font>

1111
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,070
saw it they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see it as a</font>

1112
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,810
television service they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see</font>

1113
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,700
it as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-way as you know a one-way</font>

1114
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:56,230
feed where they get information that

1115
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,029
they have to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know depending</font>

1116
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:00,210
on the type of information they want I

1117
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:03,190
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a good thing</font>

1118
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:05,800
competition and innovation is good so

network neutrality proposal were

1125
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,650
basically there would be a regulation

1126
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,860
that says as an ISP you have to you have

1127
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:25,210
to be network neutral and so he's

1134
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">about so we're just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of</font>

1135
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,590
avoid it and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

understand you know like what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1137
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean you have some people that are</font>

1138
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,450
like in the pockets of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telephone</font>

00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies and cable companies and their</font>

1140
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,689
kind of you know they're getting

1141
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,250
supported to lobby against it and then

1142
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,750
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really like should be</font>

1143
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,250
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> grok it and say hey this is a</font>

1144
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,540
bad thing they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to touch it</font>

1145
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,500
because you know they don't understand

1146
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,210
it and they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it's that whole</font>

1147
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,770
internet thing man<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sounds like a</font>

1148
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,540
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work I don't want to you know</font>

1149
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:59,350
can't we talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like abortion or</font>

1150
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:01,720
something so so you can write your

1151
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:03,910
congressperson try and educate people on

1152
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,339
the concept of network neutrality why

1153
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,859
it's a big deal and why in our country

1154
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:11,170
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does it threatens internet</font>

1155
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,420
and a consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and why</font>

1156
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,040
that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad thing the other thing you</font>

1157
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do is you can write to the FCC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1158
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,130
know this sounds like a black hole right

1159
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:23,410
looks like writing the dev null right so

1160
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:25,570
the FCC well yes and no the FCC actually

1161
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,149
you know you guys are taxpayers you pay

1162
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,250
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job they will listen to you</font>

1163
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,230
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they will do something is</font>

1164
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,180
a different story but at the end of the

1165
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,910
day they're here to serve all of us in

1166
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:39,009
this room and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they can't</font>

1167
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,390
they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make decisions for the good</font>

1168
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,720
of the people if the people aren't

1169
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:45,910
telling them what they want so as much

1170
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,259
as it sounds like a black hole<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1171
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,879
you should still do it if you if you

1172
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,350
feel that you need to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

1173
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,700
would say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the FCC</font>

1174
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:54,730
and if you need if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to</font>

1175
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,649
somebody at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FCC come to me if you</font>

1176
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,870
represent like a municipality or an

1177
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,400
organization they want to hear from

1178
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,870
organizations out there and how they

1179
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,030
feel about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and like what they can</font>

1180
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:06,130
do so if you want a direct line into the

1181
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:08,920
FCC come talk to me afterwards and I can

or whoever a copy of my slide deck and I

1214
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,090
know the slides aren't very the slides

1215
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,680
are very verbose or a lot of pictures so

1216
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,360
actually what I have pretty much

1217
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,069
everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said written down</font>

1218
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,260
so they'll be the slide deck and then

1219
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:22,750
there'll also be the dialogue to go

1220
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,800
along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I'm at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point I</font>

1224
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,880
telecommunications companies about

1225
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:46,220
putting together the free wireless the

1226
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,530
question was in Seattle have we met<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

1227
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,810
resistance from telecommunications

companies about<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting up free wireless</font>

1229
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:56,320
and building out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a free wireless network</font>

1230
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:58,520
the answer is well from the from the

1231
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,650
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the independent side we've actually</font>

1232
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,110
gotten a lot of support like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1233
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the independent ISPs I know I've said</font>

1234
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:06,320
like speakeasy five times I have no ties

1235
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,509
to them but that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one</font>

1236
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that came that came to mind there's a</font>

1237
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,060
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other ones I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asda net</font>

1238
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,070
and blog they've been really supportive

1239
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,540
of it and they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they've</font>

1240
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,710
actually come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and said we support</font>

1242
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,790
good thing but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger ones they</font>

1243
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,110
haven't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've come and</font>

1244
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,580
they've talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to kind of try and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out you know what we're going to</font>

1246
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,259

1247
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they see us as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a threat and maybe</font>

like things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mini wireless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or a good</font>

1254
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,270
example of like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

1255
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,770
predominantly geek movement and then

1256
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:48,920
turning it into something you know where

1257
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:52,250
governments are getting behind it really

1258
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,980
clean straight him to have a the larger

1259
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:56,560
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking larger telecommunications</font>

1260
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,800
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she'll remain and</font>

1261
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,490
and actually using<font color="#E5E5E5"> their lobbyists in</font>

1262
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,860
local<font color="#E5E5E5"> and state government to limit the</font>

1263
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,750
ability to put together these types of

1264
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,270
wireless network so you guys experienced

1265
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:12,940
up um I haven't experienced it

1266
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:15,400
personally but I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing one</font>

1267
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,290
thing I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say is that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know in a</font>

1268
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,540
lot of in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these situations like</font>

1269
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:23,259
in Seattle for instance you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1270
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:25,000
there really is no like city there's a

1271
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,260
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> city promoted Wi-Fi like they've</font>

1272
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,660
been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this they actually like</font>

1273
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,640
started a task force I think two or

1274
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,350
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and then in the past</font>

1275
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,240
year they just you know set up like a

1276
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,220
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of access points and Rainier</font>

1277
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,750
Valley and then it broke and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

1278
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,279
didn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for two months and so like</font>

1279
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,300
they kind of like this is funny we

1280
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,470
talked to them early on they're like

1281
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,610
yeah you know this wireless thing is

1282
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,990
great like Portland's the number one

1283
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,910
wireless city that's cool we want to be

1284
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than them and you know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1285
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:50,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Wi-Fi is awesome let's do</font>

1286
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,310
it and then they set up this task<font color="#CCCCCC"> force</font>

1287
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know two or three years later</font>

1288
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:55,240
not much has happened and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I</font>

1289
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,200
mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not involved in politics a lot</font>

1290
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">but from what I've heard that's kind of</font>

1291
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,220
typical for Seattle or as you know like

1292
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:03,520
these other places<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Corpus Christi</font>

1293
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,109
and you know Portland they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> are Austin</font>

1294
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,700
yeah exactly Austin wireless and less

1295
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,200
networks they've totally done you know

1296
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,890
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome job of working with the city</font>

1297
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,299
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the but the flip side to that too</font>

1298
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,190
is that you know there are in a lot of

1299
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,340
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> cities there are lobbyists for the</font>

1300
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,360
telcos but at the same time you know at

1301
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,980
the end of the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when</font>

1302
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,360
municipalities have gone to the telcos

1303
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,830
have been like hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that cool</font>

1304
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,690
network you got we know we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1305
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:27,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for some public service stuff for</font>

1306
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,960
you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like we want to you</font>

1307
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,820
know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make our jobs more</font>

1308
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,950
efficient in their leg up sorry you know

1309
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,300
so they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well there are</font>

1310
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,830
people there i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know like</font>

1311
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,360
these hundred and eighty-six municipal

1312
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,680
projects that you see those are like

1313
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that are tired of dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1314
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,259
that crap and so in those cases that

1315
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,370
that hasn't done any good maybe maybe in

1316
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">seattle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what's holding it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1317
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,339
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you know i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's</font>

1318
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,850
holding it up but maybe that's one of

1319
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,850
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1320
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,730
charging for premium services that you

1321
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,200
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think like Google</font>

1322
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and Yahoo setting up their own eyes peas</font>

1323
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,490
their networks take their own networks

1324
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">particularly services over and over</font>

1325
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:07,410
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> services well why do you think</font>

1326
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,910
they're doing that so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was</font>

1327
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:12,210
you know about about cable companies

1328
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:15,390
trying to charge for you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

1329
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,980
service tiered internet access and what

1330
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">about Google and companies like that</font>

1331
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,910
setting up their own networks well I

1332
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,529
mean Google's doing it right now in San

1333
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,970
Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they have that whole have</font>

1334
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys all seen that whole like Google</font>

1335
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:27,569
trailer or they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically like drop</font>

1336
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,490
the Google bomb in a city and like turn

1337
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,480
on a network like I think there's a

1338
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,220
reason why they're doing that and

1339
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,260
actually Google and Microsoft are two of

1340
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,259
the companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are actually throwing</font>

1341
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,210
money and resources at supporting net

1342
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,560
net neutrality they're actually there on

1343
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,960
the there fighting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good fight or in</font>

1344
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,520
my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good fight and so yeah I</font>

1345
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that that's a very plausible thing</font>

1346
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,530
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they you know that's</font>

1347
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:52,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a possibility but ultimately you</font>

1348
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,130
know is I mean I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you know maybe</font>

1349
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,510
five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> from now going to shoot</font>

1350
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:57,150
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is google in and take over the</font>

1351
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:04,100
internet now<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're just a search</font>

1352
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:08,450
engine right as far as as far as the

1353
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,450
pricing model changing

1354
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:17,169
say oval google or whoever has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> k to</font>

1355
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:20,799
provide a content

1356
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:25,650
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that already paying</font>

1357
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:25,650
for their their bandwidth

1358
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,010
figure

1359
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:37,020
so so right now like if you so for

1360
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:38,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance if you have a cable connection</font>

1361
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:50,009
I know what kind of internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection</font>

1362
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:56,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have at home okay right so where do</font>

1363
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:58,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about it so basically</font>

1364
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,060
like there and please let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

1365
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,259
this answers the question cuz I want to

1366
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,090
try and answer your<font color="#E5E5E5"> question but like</font>

1367
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,950
they're currently like most of the

1368
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,930
pricing models are tiered in terms of

1369
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,290
speed we're like you get you know

1370
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:12,240
certain up down for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain price and</font>

1371
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,470
the tiering that the tiering like in

1372
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,609
those quotes that I went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

1373
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,470
tiering that the price and hearing that

1374
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:19,140
they're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is not so</font>

1375
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:21,480
much it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so much tiering based off</font>

1376
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,670
of speed but tiering based off of

1377
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,290
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> where like there are services</font>

1378
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,820
like okay so here's a perfect example

1379
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:28,470
like you get an internet connection you

1380
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,570
pay you know let's say pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 bucks a</font>

1381
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,859
month for it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> fire a bit torrents</font>

1382
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,090
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> BitTorrent doesn't work you know</font>

1383
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:34,440
what the what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell is up with that</font>

1384
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,570
so you call them up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like oh</font>

1385
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,760
well you want the BitTorrent plan that's

1386
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,869
you know an extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 bucks a month that</font>

1387
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know and so it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

1388
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:44,550
services oriented thing or you know what

1389
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:48,839
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to call value-added type stuff</font>

1390
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:51,869
and value-added will take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value</font>

1391
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:54,920
so we can add it back does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

1392
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,920
that make sense is that

1393
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:05,790
exactly they do yeah Mets that's cut

1394
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:12,370
right no in that that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you</font>

1395
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:16,450
know the that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole let me go</font>

1396
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:18,490
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so uh yeah what like this</font>

1397
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:20,020
that's kind of like why this whole thing

1398
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,669
is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so asinine the internet can't be</font>

1399
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,590
free for Google or Yahoo or vonage you

1400
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,300
know it's like well there it isn't free

1401
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,800
for vonage right i mean they pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1402
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,840
their they pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their bandwidth and</font>

1403
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,130
it's not free for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer who's</font>

1404
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,230
using it because they pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their</font>

1405
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,880
bandwidth so basically like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

1406
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:35,350
trying they're like oh well suddenly you

1407
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,870
know like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> this middleman and</font>

1408
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,910
because we're the only alternative we

1409
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:41,290
can go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> P we can go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the providers</font>

1410
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,770
and say hey you want to talk to our

1411
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:47,470
customers you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to pay us that's</font>

1412
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically and so who people would say</font>

1413
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,220
well well that's never going to happen

1414
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:53,230
well you know when when ninety percent

1415
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,549
of the people in America are forced to

1416
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:57,190
get their internet connection through

1417
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:59,380
one of two providers they can do that

1418
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:00,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now they can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can get</font>

1419
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,260
your internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection from whoever</font>

1420
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:07,080
the hell you want does that make sense

1421
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:07,080
yeah okay it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> or more yeah</font>

1422
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,329
yes

1423
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,839
now they never actually launched package

1424
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,839
but they fight

1425
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:36,559
yeah so I'm sure was your name<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1426
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:38,390
Barry Barry was talking about how in his

1427
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,759
home cable connection they basically

1428
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:42,920
changed the user agreement where if you

1429
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:44,690
if you're using a VPN connection to

1430
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,430
connect to your office remote office

1431
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,289
you're basically you're violating it

1432
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:49,729
they don't actively block it but it is

1433
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:51,710
stated that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you do this</font>

1434
00:49:49,729 --> 00:49:53,538
you're you're breaking the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

1435
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,680
reserve the right to you know terminate

1436
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:56,630
your connection and so that's that's

1437
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,489
actually that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a perfect example of a</font>

1438
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,930
provider that is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> network neutral and</font>

1439
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,950
yeah they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about it</font>

1440
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,779
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been talking about it for a</font>

1441
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,149
while and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's been slowly happening and</font>

1442
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:06,890
I think does anyone know the whole the

1443
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:09,170
cable company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was blocking boy was</font>

1444
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,519
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to I don't want to</font>

1445
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:12,619
bad-mouth anybody without knowing for

1446
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:13,939
sure it was definitely them there's

1447
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:21,079
there's a cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> company that turned</font>

1448
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:22,460
around was<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so Paul right Paul</font>

1449
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:24,950
Simon Cox is doing it in South Florida

1450
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,420
where basically you know if you want to

1451
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,308
use monitor these services they're

1452
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,200
blocking like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIP in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our TSP ports</font>

1453
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:33,019
and you know you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay them an</font>

1454
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,879
extra ten bucks to do it and so the flip

1455
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:36,319
side of that so when one other thing to

1456
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,369
hear is that like so the cable company

1457
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,319
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the cable business for a long</font>

1458
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:41,690
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> the telco wants to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1459
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:44,390
providing TV on demand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

1460
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:46,819
stuff so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's a</font>

1461
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,989
really like I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's people would say</font>

1462
00:50:46,819 --> 00:50:49,308
well the telephone company is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

1463
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:50,479
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that the cable company mike is</font>

1464
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:52,130
that's their business model but the

1465
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:53,598
telephone company has been looking at

1466
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,910
the cable companies business mall for a

1467
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,289
long time because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the telephone</font>

1468
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,308
companies have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been like oh we've gotta</font>

1469
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:00,559
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to bend over</font>

1470
00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:02,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">backwards to hook all these people up</font>

1471
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,739
into our d slams and give them access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1472
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,509
our copper lines and meanwhile you know

1473
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:07,329
these cable companies have been have<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

1474
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:10,549
it easy they can just basically say no

1475
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:11,479
when user<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network no go away and so</font>

1476
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:12,319
they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that and they're</font>

1477
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:14,390
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all the money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're making</font>

1478
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,319
and so they're they're starting to move

1479
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:22,200
towards that same towards the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

1480
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:24,060
anybody else yes

1481
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,770
Wi-Fi stuff are you saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the</font>

1482
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:29,310
police pull me over i should do I still

1483
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:33,570
look I'm not saying you should do

1484
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:35,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything don't do anything any good I i</font>

1485
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:39,329
I'm not telling you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to do anything</font>

1486
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what that brings up a very</font>

1487
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:46,560
good point and so the question was if if

1488
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,779
you get pulled over<font color="#E5E5E5"> by you know cop in a</font>

1489
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,160
city with municipal Wi-Fi should you

1490
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,960
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know do s their Wi-Fi</font>

1491
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,339
connection to prevent you know your

1492
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,260
friend of being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up your</font>

1493
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">license and give you a ticket my</font>

1494
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:00,359
response is no probably not a good idea

1495
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,880
but it brings up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a point a point which I</font>

1496
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:05,060
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> alluding to earlier where if</font>

1497
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,040
municipal wireless networks are buying

1498
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:10,680
proprietary solutions then there really

1499
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,390
is no guarantee that you know the

1500
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">security is as good as these companies</font>

1501
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:17,129
say it is because there are no like open

1502
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,440
test results<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know like for</font>

1503
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:21,030
instance a good example of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you</font>

1504
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,240
know like the the encryption algorithm

1505
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:26,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">used for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GSM was you know closed</font>

1506
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,509
encryption algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like I</font>

1507
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:29,670
don't worry it's secure and secure it

1508
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:32,280
secure it's got a 64-bit key well you

1509
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,839
know come to find out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

1510
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,619
bits were all zeros and every key you

1511
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:39,029
know so the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself made you</font>

1512
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,109
know work to a degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then the way</font>

1513
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,760
they implemented it could be completely

1514
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:43,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">asinine but you really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and those invite</font>

1515
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,609
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way of knowing that and</font>

1516
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,750
that's and that's kind of a scary thing

1517
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:47,310
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean because they're like talking</font>

1518
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">about running their cities off of it and</font>

1519
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,390
I mean yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know wireless is not</font>

1520
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:53,520
secure we know that but it's inevitable

1521
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:54,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are going to use it and the only</font>

1522
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that we can make it the only way</font>

1523
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:58,020
that we can make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better especially</font>

1524
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:59,760
you know in situations where cities

1525
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,990
depend on it for infrastructure start to

1526
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,089
the pendant it for infrastructure is

1527
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,859
this is if they use open standards and

1528
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:07,170
open technologies where you know people

1529
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:12,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this room can figure out what's wrong</font>

1530
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,650
