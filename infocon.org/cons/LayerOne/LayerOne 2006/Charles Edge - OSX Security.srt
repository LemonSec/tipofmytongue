1
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,260
alright so my name is Charles edge I

2
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,910
wrote that book<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've handed out</font>

3
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,550
today I'm going to talk about just<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS 10</font>

4
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,419
security I guess for the most part this

5
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,099
might be like synonymous with security

6
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">44 in OSS or something of that nature</font>

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,080
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here use OS 10 server</font>

8
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,789
specifically and how many people use OS

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:09,640
10 so in just a couple more right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I yeah</font>

10
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
I see those velcro<font color="#E5E5E5"> da</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fone closets all</font>

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,960
the time these days like where's your

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,630
ftp server oh it's right there hey

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,860
velcroed that's but whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> works right</font>

14
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to play my slideshow if</font>

15
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,790
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I like to do this so i can</font>

16
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,470
switch between apps someone complained

17
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,130
one time than i did that so hopefully

18
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:32,020
you guys were all right with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

19
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,119
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get started just a note on what</font>

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,649
she was talking about before I'm all for

21
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,210
greater transparency at the corporate

22
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,890
level for security and stuff I can't

23
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,770
tell you how many companies I come in to

24
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:44,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">where if it weren't for socks they'd</font>

25
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,619
still be running smtp open relays and

26
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,580
all kinds of stupid crap and I'm just

27
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:56,440
totally all for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so just</font>

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:58,570
on a side note<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so yeah</font>

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,789
security through brute force by the

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:05,380
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess for lack of a better</font>

31
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:07,510
word yeah yeah I mean totally no talents

32
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,959
us admins running around deploying

33
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,299
solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> 400,000 users bugs the hell</font>

34
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,060
out of me but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so Mac os10</font>

35
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:18,299
server i titled it kind of open source

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,600
made easy because that's apples tagline

37
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:24,130
back in the day OS 9 totally easy kind

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,810
of difficult to crack just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

39
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,440
one ever played with it but now it's

40
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a standard old next distribution so</font>

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,530
anything that works in the next

42
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment is going to work in OS 10</font>

43
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,350
for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get it to</font>

44
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:40,000
compile so users that require easy

45
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,799
solutions often don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the skills to</font>

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,019
secure their own solutions kind of like

47
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,940
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft small business server so</font>

48
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,130
whereas Microsoft has for example

49
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,549
deprecated the use of small business

50
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,329
server as a terminal server OS Mac is

51
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,800
there

52
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,300
still you know three or four years

53
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,760
behind Microsoft and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this stuff</font>

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,190
and they haven't been started to do

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,750
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so when they can sense</font>

56
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,430
so far all right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in users and</font>

57
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,230
the Mac community are pretty resistant

58
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,810
to basic security concepts because they

59
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,239
haven't had to practice those a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

60
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,100
times with OS 9 traffic wasn't routable

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,010
so people really didn't worry about

62
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:24,010
securing perimeter and stuff like that

63
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:26,350
you have a question or no all right all

64
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,170
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so Mac specifics to a standard</font>

65
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,329
nixed distro<font color="#CCCCCC"> apples really hardcore</font>

66
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,859
about plist files they really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

67
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML format so they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

68
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:40,000
convert that CF and dot com files over

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,010
to PHP lists they keep everything in a

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,400
net info database so whereas you won't

71
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,140
see dot password files or things of that

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,240
nature you do see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of stuff locked</font>

73
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,708
into the net info database which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font>

74
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,750
of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because later down the</font>

75
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,400
road when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start talking about how</font>

76
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,910
they've got openldap built and stuff

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,310
like that they they lock all this stuff

78
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,000
in there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everything is encrypted</font>

79
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:06,580
at a higher rate and stuff like that so

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">file system is normally not ufs on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac</font>

81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">os10 server is normally OSX extended</font>

82
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,290
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> lazarus up in San Francisco can do</font>

83
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,090
a lot of recovery stuff for a little

84
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than some of the places down here</font>

85
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,159
like drivesavers all the files and apps

86
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,460
are in the wrong place for those of us

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,290
who have used<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache for a long time if</font>

88
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,510
you sit down on<font color="#CCCCCC"> an OS 10 server you're</font>

89
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,760
going to be like where where's

90
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,289
everything at or pretty much any other

91
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">program for that matter that Apple</font>

92
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,720
decides to implement they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

93
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">about taking code out of the open source</font>

94
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,290
community and they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

95
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,020
about giving code back but they're not

96
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,130
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about conforming to</font>

97
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,870
kind of the standards of where we put

98
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,669
things so not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very difficult</font>

99
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to find anything with allocate command</font>

100
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:53,710
or something like that but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

101
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:59,320
a good point<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make and then server</font>

102
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:01,450
manager server<font color="#E5E5E5"> and grd is sometimes if</font>

103
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,120
you do at it let's say the<font color="#CCCCCC"> httpd.conf</font>

104
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">file you're going to notice that like</font>

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,710
your timeout value doesn't actual

106
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,660
change so where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you supposed to</font>

107
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do that and a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of times it's</font>

108
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,280
locked inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of net info and rather</font>

109
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,750
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to edit some of those</font>

110
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,789
values directly you actually have to use

111
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,000
the server manager demon does that make

112
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:25,330
sense and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> another difference</font>

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,550
between the Mac community there's a lot

114
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">of GUI tools for pretty much anything</font>

115
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:33,970
including chmod if you can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

116
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,830
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious like Mac the Mac</font>

117
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,130
community in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact I haven't installed</font>

118
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,590
here a show but batch<font color="#E5E5E5"> mod it's just like</font>

119
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,700
a little you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> click for boxes and</font>

120
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:47,919
there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go so and it even does Rick it</font>

121
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,120
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> does recursion for those of you</font>

122
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,280
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out how to use an R in</font>

123
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,550
your command line segments exactly but

124
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,049
um but but you know with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

125
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,990
this stuff when it starts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more</font>

126
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,590
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> than like a chmod or or</font>

127
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,860
shown like by<font color="#E5E5E5"> building these types of</font>

128
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:11,380
tools with programs like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Coco you're</font>

129
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,479
kind of sponsoring the deployment of

130
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,440
them on a wider scale for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

131
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:19,090
deploy hen wen or snort to a client and

132
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,580
they can manage it even if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

133
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,260
an IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> company because it's got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GUI</font>

134
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,000
front end whereas maybe they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

135
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,370
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if it was a command line only</font>

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">tool so it's kind of by having GUI apps</font>

137
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,500
for a lot of the security tools that we

138
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,600
use it actually sponsors more Spurs more

139
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:39,790
in-depth use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> client</font>

140
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,770
side so so entertainment specifics

141
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,740
obviously the mac is pretty heavily used

142
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,320
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entertainment sphere I kind of</font>

143
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,030
subtitled this slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> no they target if</font>

144
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,340
you're doing penetration testing or

145
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,979
security and a Mac environment one of

146
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,630
the biggest things is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

147
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">are graphics houses where people don't</font>

148
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,350
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use passwords or in some cases</font>

149
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,640
according to the application sets that

150
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,440
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using they actually can't use</font>

151
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,200
passwords and things of that nature so

152
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,700
we do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of physical subnetting or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font>

153
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,280
landing to get around some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

154
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,280
but still it's it's great stuff to know

155
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,260
about the users<font color="#E5E5E5"> really aren't used to</font>

156
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,729
even having passwords much less having

157
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,469
to change them on their own every

158
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">any days or something that nature so</font>

159
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:21,159
when you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone who's</font>

160
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">been using computers for 20 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

161
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:24,969
never had a password for logging into

162
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,349
their computer it's kind of hard

163
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,029
sometimes to say okay well you need to

164
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:29,438
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it every 30 days so no one brute</font>

165
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:33,659
forces that or something of that nature

166
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:37,180
so especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those root passwords</font>

167
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:39,909
I actually had a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

168
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">months ago where a client had their root</font>

169
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:45,400
password on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 servers as the word root</font>

170
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,289
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was kind of special and</font>

171
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,058
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of open wireless networks</font>

172
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,460
in the Mac community they can't seem to

173
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:53,589
remember the passwords to bandy about

174
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,330
and things of that nature if you're

175
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:57,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">driving through West Hollywood that's</font>

176
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably one of the easiest places i</font>

177
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:03,639
would guess around to actually do some

178
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,930
some more driving users often want to

179
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,460
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own servers they walk into</font>

180
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,110
the apple store some guy in the apple

181
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,149
store talks me into an xserve they take

182
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,399
it home they still can't figure out why

183
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,779
it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big but they put it on</font>

184
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,849
the desk they turn it on they click

185
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:17,830
start for web server and they put the

186
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:20,378
files where they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's it they</font>

187
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:23,318
don't do anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by default a</font>

188
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,399
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll cover that later but a lot</font>

189
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,740
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are enabled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't be they should be explicitly</font>

191
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,219
enabled kind of the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of</font>

192
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:35,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">other distributions now are doing it</font>

193
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:37,689
like selinux so and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess for</font>

194
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,429
ldap as well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know any other program</font>

195
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,459
it's just like you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the start</font>

196
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:43,870
button and it's suddenly an ftp server

197
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:48,099
and that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always a good thing</font>

198
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:50,860
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so AFP specifically most of the</font>

199
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that that I've written as far as</font>

200
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,269
exploits go target AFP because everyone

201
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:56,500
else has already done openldap and

202
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,420
everyone else is already done a patchy

203
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,160
so it makes it for in for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more</font>

204
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,540
groundbreaking or interesting type stuff

205
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,360
although the same principles that apply

206
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:12,430
to like SMB would apply to AFP AFP is

207
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">just what happened to Apple talk and and</font>

208
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,079
it's like Apple<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked with multicast</font>

209
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS to find other servers and stuff like</font>

210
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:23,589
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those of you haven't used it</font>

211
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:25,180
AFP by default runs over port 548 so if

212
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,519
you're actually looking for open servers

213
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,569
out there you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> search for you</font>

214
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,569
know do a port scan

215
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">4548 AFP had a known vulnerability that</font>

216
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,330
gave a<font color="#E5E5E5"> root most of the vulnerabilities</font>

217
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:44,079
for apple stuff give or<font color="#E5E5E5"> just straight do</font>

218
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,850
s attacks specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> there have been</font>

219
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,850
three or four now for AFP that actually

220
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:51,610
gave route and and that was included in

221
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit last year at Def Con I guess</font>

222
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,060
someone demoed that AFP still has

223
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,590
similar vulnerabilities but because of

224
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,780
the way Apple patches things like that

225
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,050
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch the specific buffer they</font>

226
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,360
don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother to figure out why</font>

227
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,250
why the algorithm was able to to do that

228
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,440
if that makes sense so they'll just

229
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,230
patch each specific buffering then the

230
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,910
next one you can always like he was

231
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,010
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier fuzz it and find</font>

232
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">another one that'll kind of do the same</font>

233
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:24,069
thing so and then one nice thing about

234
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,170
AFP is you can actually run AFP over ssh

235
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,970
it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> check box they made it nice</font>

236
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,620
and easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all you have to do is</font>

237
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,510
check that box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

238
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:36,910
mitigates that as a as a possible

239
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:38,800
exploit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm one of the thing like I</font>

240
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:45,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a second ago Apache with</font>

its mods by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default when I okay by</font>

242
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,120
default all these these are the modules

243
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,469
that are enabled I know an OS 10 server

244
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:57,250
that when you start up apache personally

245
00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:01,900
some of these i I don't I don't think

246
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,430
should be enabled the I I don't know

247
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,819
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what else to say about that except</font>

248
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,739
for I've yet to see someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who set up</font>

249
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,180
an OS 10 server other than myself as a

250
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,180
web server that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually bothered to</font>

251
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,890
disable the module so they weren't using

252
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,199
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times people will argue</font>

253
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:20,080
back if I do do it well what if my

254
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,790
developers need to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jakarta it's like</font>

255
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">well then let's install a later version</font>

256
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,980
of Jakarta than the one that Apple

257
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:29,050
included you know like with something

258
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">like if you're installing a centos box</font>

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:42,640

I'm SSI PHP

263
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,240
luckily they didn't enable folder

listings this revision<font color="#CCCCCC"> intend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to by</font>

turned on by default which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally</font>

268
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,959
find to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be quite quite annoying when I</font>

269
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,090
find a server that's been turned into a

270
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,590
fishing server because someone exploited

271
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,110
performance caching on it or something

272
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,000
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a lot of these things are</font>

273
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,560
just kind of not to use a buzz word but

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,990
best practices you know you turn off

275
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,000
which are not using I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally think</font>

276
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,710
that by default you should be turning on

277
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,280
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using rather than turning</font>

off what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using but um but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:46,300
that actually bothered to put a password

288
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,060
on PHP myadmin so if you're trying to

289
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,829
exploit OS 10 server that's always a

290
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,439
pretty easy place to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because</font>

291
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,000
the users don't understand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

292
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,860
leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the web developers to</font>

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,330
actually do both the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

294
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:03,340
security and right yeah putting a yeah

295
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">just doing an HT access realm and OS 10</font>

296
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,940
server there's actually a feature called

297
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:12,810
realm and it'll do all that stuff for

298
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:15,010
you but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have yet to see ya the Roma I</font>

299
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,300
don't know if I I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these red dots</font>

300
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,280
so i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

301
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:23,050
to show me but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go into a site</font>

302
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,550
you can click on realms and then you can

303
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,170
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> add e at a realm which is</font>

304
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gooey friend and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">HT access it just doesn't use HT access</font>

306
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:37,360
files yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly um no it's it's it's</font>

307
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,310
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> although you know when you are</font>

308
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,830
logging into an htaccess file a lot of

309
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,239
times it does say realm so you know it's

310
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:48,940
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of easy to correlate what they do</font>

311
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:53,580
and I cover it in my book<font color="#CCCCCC"> realms</font>

312
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:56,499
specifically um because<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of times</font>

313
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,209
clients will will refuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

314
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:01,779
troubleshoot with their clients if

315
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:03,638
they're having ftp issues and you know

316
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,169
ftp behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat sometimes you have to</font>

317
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,779
step people through enabling or

318
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:11,789
disabling certain check boxes which are

319
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:16,779
totally far too difficult to figure out

320
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:18,729
so every client that used<font color="#E5E5E5"> my sequel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

321
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,529
I ran into so far in the field has had

322
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:23,229
the allowed network connections turned

323
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,789
on only<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe two of them needed it so</font>

324
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:30,939
that's that's kind of another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to</font>

325
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:32,589
look for and then I'm sorry well just

326
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,449
you know with with my sequel you can

327
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:38,039
disable the ability for any IP other

328
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:40,598
than localhost yeah so and that in OS 10

329
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,789
you can't see it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can grab the</font>

330
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:44,439
screenshot and bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here but</font>

331
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:47,259
it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> check box so all you'd have</font>

332
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:52,319
to do literally is uncheck the box but

333
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:54,489
no one actually bothers to so fun stuff

334
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,959
in other words they make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy</font>

335
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:58,869
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security audits and Mac</font>

336
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,429
environments because it's like okay well

337
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:05,709
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out why you have 80 open</font>

338
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:08,379
ports for a web server so post fix the

339
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:10,929
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really much to say here it's</font>

340
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,609
a typical post pics implementation it

341
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:14,799
does have claimed assess and<font color="#CCCCCC"> claim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AV</font>

342
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:16,269
already integrated which makes it kind

343
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,239
of easy you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on start you check a</font>

344
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,859
box and you're you're golden another

345
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:22,720
nice thing is that they've integrated it

346
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:25,569
with sasal so your passwords are all

347
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,199
stored and secure hashes which is kind

348
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:36,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">of kind of nice does anyone here work</font>

349
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:37,988
for Apple<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right on shows that they</font>

350
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,879
care a lot about their security last

351
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:41,319
year or two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago at Def Con when I</font>

352
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,389
was speaking and asked that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one at</font>

353
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:50,978
<font color="#CCCCCC">raise their hand either which is always</font>

354
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:52,929
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun well you know they yeah they</font>

355
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:57,389
ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of free iPods to give people so</font>

356
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:57,389
that they wouldn't get hurt so

357
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:08,630
ah it was too far flight from<font color="#CCCCCC"> cupertino</font>

358
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:12,140
so samba<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it's a slightly older</font>

359
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:14,510
release<font color="#E5E5E5"> of samba it's SMB signings not</font>

360
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,130
supported by<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple yet which apparently</font>

361
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,830
they've promised me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

362
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,630
changed in leopard by default every

<font color="#E5E5E5">SMB even if you don't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to and most</font>

368
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,180
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac administrators that I know</font>

369
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,680
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think to hit that little drop-down</font>

370
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,989
box right here where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says went</font>

371
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,760
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says Apple filing protocol</font>

372
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,650
when you first open it and change it to

373
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,750
windows and see if windows if they're

374
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,100
creating SMB share points and ftp share

375
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,320
points both of which have guessed

376
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,300
enabled so you know you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

377
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">an app and you can disable those</font>

378
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,780
globally and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mitigate that but</font>

379
00:16:51,980 --> 00:17:03,950
at the same time you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

380
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:05,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing that so sorry no</font>

381
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,800
nothing is read only by<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by</font>

write for owner reading right for user

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then read only for her guests for</font>

385
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,720
everyone yeah so right but but ever

386
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,280
since they integrated ACLs like I've

387
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">been seeing a lot of Mac administrators</font>

388
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,970
do some pretty pretty retarded things

389
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,850
with file permissions and they'll add

390
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,530
like the ww user on a on their

391
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,179
executives sharepoint where they're

392
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,350
keeping all their financial data or

393
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,710
something silly like that and you're

394
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:42,290
like what what were you thinking and

395
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:44,360
their responses usually nevermind so I'm

396
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,250
for samba they I do think that they've

397
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">done some nice things GUI tool wise</font>

398
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:52,190
although something like webmin is going

399
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:56,030
to give a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> more features they've got</font>

400
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,820
ntlm v2 ntlm and land man all turned on

401
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:01,100
by default<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they should just</font>

402
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,409
do maybe ncl<font color="#CCCCCC"> m v2 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uncheck the other</font>

403
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,209
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess a lot of this is about like</font>

404
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,460
just disabling defaults and the same is

405
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,470
true for a lot of other OSS but like an

406
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Active Directory they've actually gone</font>

407
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,710
the extra step

408
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,020
and pseudo secured the box before you

409
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn it on you know password policies</font>

410
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,170
are enabled and stuff like that whereas

411
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">a macro Austin they haven't really</font>

412
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:24,830
bothered to do that yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I put this</font>

413
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,420
down for samba but logging is set to low

414
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,600
by default that's true for every module

415
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">on OS 10 server so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to</font>

416
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,070
if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get decent logs turn up</font>

417
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the verbosity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess for lack of a</font>

418
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,419
better word of the the logging and in

419
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,410
some cases there aren't doing tools for

420
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:45,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some cases there are them and</font>

421
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">samba connect an OS 10 server as also</font>

422
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">unbekannt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess but there's GUI tools</font>

423
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,020
to make it just act<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a PDC although</font>

424
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,760
there's only like four boxes to fill in

425
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,480
for it so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really highly</font>

426
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,670
configurable virtual shares are turned

427
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,880
on by<font color="#CCCCCC"> default and every box as a</font>

428
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,860
workgroup master by default so in cups

429
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">one one interesting thing when you turn</font>

430
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,939
on the cup server and OS 10 server by

431
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,730
default it turns on the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> frontend for</font>

432
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">cups and there's no password on it which</font>

433
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,720
was always really nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and I</font>

434
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,420
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember off the top of my head</font>

435
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">does anyone else know the Pat the port</font>

436
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:27,560
for the for the web frontend for cups

437
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:29,060
right so if I were<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write if I were if</font>

438
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,429
i were to install that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now i guess</font>

439
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,470
you know if i were to turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you</font>

440
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:36,080
guys would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but by</font>

441
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,490
default it also listens on all adapters

442
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,439
and the other day<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was at a client who</font>

443
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,940
had for some reason they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> put an</font>

444
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,950
airport card in their own stun server

445
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,840
and it was their wireless access point

446
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,800
but it was an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless access point</font>

447
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,419
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can imagine like inside</font>

448
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,659
your server having an open wireless

449
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:57,170
access point is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just yeah i mean</font>

450
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:59,270
the the level of security stuff and is

451
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,370
pretty amazing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font>

452
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,280
entertainment space<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess as far as</font>

453
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:07,189
market share goes but it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> my job</font>

454
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,600
pretty easy i think so I chat server

455
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,360
they're definitely using a pretty old

456
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,129
version of ichat or a jabber I don't

457
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,750
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone here is implement a job</font>

458
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,790
or two point oh but there's a whole lot

459
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">of new stuff in it and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much better</font>

460
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,899
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they should update it but</font>

461
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,340
like with almost every other service

462
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,980
they have integrated jabber whip

463
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,030
so they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't turn it on by default</font>

464
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,470
I this is minus this<font color="#E5E5E5"> default ssl</font>

465
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:36,270
certificate is actually something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

466
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:38,340
changed but by default nearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

467
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,770
service is<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL integrated they just</font>

468
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,459
haven't turned them on did I say that

469
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,720
already so and there's there's not

470
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,810
really any encryption so i use

471
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,730
personally I'm fire as my jabber client

472
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:54,409
I don't know if you guys amused that but

473
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:58,440
as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as Mexico it does does support um</font>

474
00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:00,180
encrypted message traffic so in an open

475
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,130
directory open directory is Apple's kind

476
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:07,740
of code name for openldap sasal Kerberos

477
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,300
slapd<font color="#E5E5E5"> slurpee they kind of just threw</font>

478
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,130
everything that they can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

479
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,680
easy to build something<font color="#CCCCCC"> so kind of like</font>

480
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:17,070
Active Directory together and called it

481
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,510
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> directory so so they do all the</font>

482
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,580
integration of that stuff for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so if</font>

483
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,800
you're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a an ldap server</font>

484
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,439
it's just it's pretty pretty simple and

485
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,180
straightforward all usernames and

486
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,710
passwords are<font color="#CCCCCC"> stored</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the net info</font>

487
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,690
database and leopard that's going to

488
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,250
change their totally deprecating that

489
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,920
info and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to use sasal</font>

490
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:38,220
for a lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff then then they</font>

491
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,290
have been now all usernames and all

492
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,290
policies are disabled by default so by

493
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,550
default there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no lockout on you know</font>

494
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,889
three times when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're out for</font>

495
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,590
passwords and stuff like that which you

496
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,180
know you can enable it but but it

497
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,360
doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for administrative users</font>

498
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,310
which is always kind of kind of nice one

499
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,260
thing I didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put on my AFP</font>

500
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:02,010
slide there's a checkbox that's enabled

501
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,230
by default for masquerade for AFP and

502
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,110
what that does is it means you can use

503
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:10,020
any administrative password with any

504
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,899
user name so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say your user is root</font>

505
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,370
or let's say your your user is Bob you

506
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:19,710
can use the root password to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in as</font>

507
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:21,810
Bob so if you if you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> though and</font>

508
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,810
this is on OS 10 server specifically for

509
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:27,149
AFP<font color="#E5E5E5"> SharePoint's so that's always kind</font>

510
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,980
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fun thing when you know yeah I</font>

511
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,990
guess they put it they put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

512
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it back out every release or so</font>

513
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:35,910
so if you're running like 10 36 it might

514
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,080
not be there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you're running 10 10</font>

515
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,540
3 4

516
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,010
or it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like a argument</font>

517
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have within the development team</font>

518
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:48,000
for OS 10 server as to whether or not

519
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:52,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a good idea so Mac admins are lazy</font>

520
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,480
for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part and they don't well I</font>

521
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,100
mean I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's for the administrators</font>

522
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:02,790
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to troubleshoot permission</font>

523
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:03,990
issues for local for users I'm right

524
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,879
there with you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

525
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,740
take it out as a feature period even

526
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it's not listed as a checkbox you</font>

527
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,390
can actually enable using server manager

528
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:15,240
so but but in 10 46 and is currently

529
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,310
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like I said they take it</font>

530
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,490
out sometimes put it back you know it's

531
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:25,440
it's always and it's under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AFP and</font>

532
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:28,680
server admin anyone cares so so that's

533
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,740
open directory the next part of open

534
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,870
directory<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess is client management</font>

535
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,970
Apple has implemented kind of Active

536
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:39,600
Directory style client management using

537
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">mcx files and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always fun to</font>

538
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,189
blast out to a whole group the fact that

539
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:51,030
their screens do that when they boot up

540
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:53,400
but but never a good idea so the I guess

541
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,960
this is just indicative of them having

542
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,420
new policies that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

543
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,130
implement we did this with a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

544
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,780
different federal agencies that have it

545
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,670
where no discs can be inserted and

546
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,100
drives and stuff like that rather than

547
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:08,310
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know put gum in the driver whatever</font>

548
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,969
we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just used use this for for roaming</font>

549
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:13,290
profiles and stuff one thing that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

550
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,840
of nice about this is you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

551
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,879
push out File Vault and you can push out

552
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,500
that every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say empty trash it</font>

553
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,010
does like a secure empty trash or

554
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,930
something of that nature so but I'm but

555
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,570
this does that make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> mcx style</font>

556
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,870
updates for clients you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know control the</font>

557
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,970
appearance of clients control the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc</font>

558
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:35,189
control that they can't put USB flash

559
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,020
drives and their computers or that the

560
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,610
computers won't even boot without you

561
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:43,230
know going into netboot or something

562
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:46,139
like that the client management it's in

563
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:49,380
it's a workgroup manager and it's just

564
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:52,980
under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Preferences button but the</font>

565
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,780
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean instead of issuing policies</font>

566
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,750
to clients when they log on us you or

567
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,850
policy files like dat files you're

568
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,070
issuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> AMC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x-files to control their</font>

569
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,080
environment and you you can customize

570
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:06,659
the mcx files and say okay well if

571
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:20,460
you're running Photoshop you don't have

572
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:23,190
these features or right yep it's exactly

573
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,200
like like policies yeah like<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font>

574
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">style policies I mean it's and you can</font>

575
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,820
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> load mcx files into active</font>

576
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,400
directory if you extend your schema and

577
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:36,240
had have active directory apply policies

578
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,940
to max using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> active</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> directory plugin</font>

579
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,690
on in OS 10 which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> active</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> directory</font>

580
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">plugin is is really well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> written i think</font>

581
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,510
almost no active directory

582
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,730
implementation is perfect and so we see

583
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:51,180
a lot of max falling off because there's

584
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:53,190
an issue with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some weird flag</font>

585
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,710
in some weird part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the forest you</font>

586
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,720
know but but overall it's it's pretty

587
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,580
good if it could do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> better I</font>

588
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,140
would say it could be that it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

589
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,129
more forgiving to active directory if

590
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,130
there's an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with active directory</font>

591
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:16,350
for for heterogeneous<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our hybrid</font>

592
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,480
environments like that we we do a lot of

593
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,040
what we call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Golden Triangle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

594
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,540
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put an open directory server for an</font>

595
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">Active Directory server we bind the two</font>

596
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:28,139
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way for authentication</font>

597
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,790
and authorization they're using Active

598
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,160
Directory but then for password policies

599
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,990
they're using open directory we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

600
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,090
do that if they're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend</font>

601
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,820
their active directory schema otherwise

602
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,340
we'll just implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> an openldap and</font>

603
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:45,149
maybe pull four or five records from

604
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,679
that some of that nature and hope that

605
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,150
they don't fall off we see a lot of OS

606
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,650
10 servers when they're plugged into

607
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,110
active directory networks that just fall

608
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,060
off and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rebind and in</font>

609
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:57,030
the process of rebinding then your

610
00:26:54,060 --> 00:27:01,260
clients are active you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know um Apple has</font>

611
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:03,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">a big firm right which you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know in</font>

612
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,879
graphics environments that they'll start

613
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,159
crying you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally I mean graphic</font>

614
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,400
designers or like that they cry<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

615
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:17,070
drop of a hat yeah it's must come from

616
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:19,110
living in Santa Monica<font color="#CCCCCC"> I live in santa</font>

617
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:23,669
monica by the way so Ashley I live in

618
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:25,560
Hollywood no but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS you know older</font>

619
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,650
verte<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just to get back real</font>

620
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,770
quick before I move on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it and a</font>

621
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,420
apple selling OS 10 server from on the

622
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,889
their enterprise group is selling it

623
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,410
pretty heavy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like companies like</font>

624
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:41,100
Disney and Universal as a replacement

625
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:43,700
for Windows servers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're they're</font>

626
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,719
having really good sales and then I

627
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,030
sometimes contract with apple

628
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,680
professional services and go in and fix

629
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,930
the issues that they've they've left me

630
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,780
with from a sales standpoint and you

631
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:57,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they don't support SMB signing as a</font>

632
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,250
file server which is or as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client to</font>

633
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,439
file servers which is pretty huge they

634
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,760
also don't yeah

635
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,330
we're in the man in the middle room

636
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,100
right I mean yeah exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> all windows</font>

637
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,230
file servers by default ship with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and</font>

638
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,750
be signing turned on and if you're in a

639
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,460
star box type environment you want to be

640
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,650
able to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> files from the mac side of</font>

641
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,420
the window side you have to get a third

642
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:24,200
party piece of software like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave to do</font>

643
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:26,330
it if that one feature is required if

644
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,680
they would insert that which they say

645
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,689
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in leopard then that</font>

646
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:35,090
would remove the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need for something like</font>

647
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:38,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dave for the most part so so DNS same</font>

648
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,280
thing most packages that Apple has

649
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,530
implemented in the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and server do</font>

650
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:47,680
have do s exploits so that's you know

651
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:50,570
but then again what doesn't right so

652
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,530
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting from a DHCP</font>

653
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:57,500
standpoint ldap<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh open directory can be</font>

654
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:59,540
settings can be configured to be sent to

655
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,730
clients of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so clients will</font>

656
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,990
bind automatically to your open

657
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,230
directory environment so you could

658
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">theoretically install</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP on your</font>

659
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:11,030
laptop go into an apple environment fire

660
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,830
it up and have people binding to your

661
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,990
open directory server on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your laptop and</font>

662
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,090
therefore you can implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> mcx files</font>

663
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,730
against them things of that nature it's

664
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,520
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wildly the options that</font>

665
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:25,250
that are the loopholes or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

666
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,540
they've thrown in there but um<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

667
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,340
one of the ways to get around that is

668
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,070
just to make sure that everything has

669
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:36,080
sasal turned on or<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL turned on in</font>

670
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:37,760
there in the OS so firewall in that they

671
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,520
don't use IP tables they don't use IP

672
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,310
chains they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipfw which is kind of</font>

673
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool but because it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy but</font>

674
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,200
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more limited you can't</font>

675
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,770
block based on a mac address of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

676
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,570
or something in that nature dummy net

677
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,980
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to shape traffic with open</font>

678
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,720
directory you can have an open directory

679
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,330
master in an open directory<font color="#CCCCCC"> replicate</font>

680
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,540
kind of like having two active directory

681
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,159
controllers but your open directory

682
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,830
master is always because it's the

683
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,690
password server going to be the primary

684
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,370
server that everybody logs into so if

685
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,660
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to balance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your traffic you</font>

686
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,760
have to use something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dummy net to</font>

687
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,400
do it which can be kind of frustrating

688
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,430
for people who don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to open</font>

689
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">amlin shell you know because that's only</font>

690
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,200
available through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> command line they</font>

691
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:26,270
do have a you know the ability does to

692
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,450
build rules but the rules are just for

693
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:30,710
accepting tonight and then they built

694
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,720
this I don't know why they actually

695
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,670
bothered to deploy it because it doesn't

696
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,150
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right but they built this</font>

697
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:41,390
s2s bpn program that is supposed to

698
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:44,950
allow you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build site site VPNs but it</font>

699
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:47,720
really doesn't work very well well

700
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,550
rather than half<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess the idea was</font>

701
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,470
rather than have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know install an</font>

702
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,740
ad on one server and install an add on

703
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:56,870
another and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then bridge them that you</font>

704
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:01,370
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use estás VPN to</font>

705
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:03,649
automatically do all that eh it doesn't

706
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,780
support aggressive mode stuff which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

707
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,780
pretty typical amongst most routers but

708
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,700
be it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't the like you give a</font>

709
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:15,410
hash key give another hash key and it

710
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:18,410
just doesn't find like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work</font>

711
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,820
reliably I've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work and I put it</font>

712
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,550
in my book but I wish I to put a

713
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,280
disclaimer saying you know that it

714
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:28,399
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work reliably which which</font>

715
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:31,639
really and deployment strategy means it

716
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,690
doesn't work right so but but it's still

717
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,550
there and I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feeling that in the</font>

718
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,860
next version though they'll fix it they

719
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,750
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called the Gateway</font>

720
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,629
setup assistant which will<font color="#E5E5E5"> build NAT and</font>

721
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:46,820
all your IP Ching oh I'm all your ipfw

722
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:48,140
calm stuff for you and the ipfw stuff

723
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,240
that you can configure from the front

724
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,070
from the GUI is definitely very limited

725
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,800
compared to what you can do with ipfw

726
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:57,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm so the configuration file can do a</font>

727
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole lot more than the GUI can as in</font>

728
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,810
almost any case right and then they

729
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,420
wrote their own rather than deploy

730
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:10,970
openvpn they just wrote their own VPN d

731
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:12,860
that that really has pretty limited

732
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,770
support this is the extent of their

733
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,689
options for it so if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some</font>

734
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:21,020
some pretty serious VPN stuff you have

735
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:22,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use open VPN which has been compiled</font>

737
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,300

738
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,930
box and you're here I'm guessing that

739
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,440
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:32,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">importance but darlin ports is just a</font>

741
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,140
collection of compiled software that

742
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:41,000
works in Darwin that guys have

743
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:43,940
contributed so I'm personally a huge fan

744
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,640
of Donovan ports so their ftp

745
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,250
implementation is<font color="#CCCCCC"> TN ftp has anyone here</font>

746
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,880
used that every user has to have a shell

747
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:56,090
account which which isn't true for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

748
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">ftp software of course i find this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

749
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,770
an incredible limitation because every

750
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,650
user in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the environment has has a shell</font>

751
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:08,320
and you can use jails but no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

752
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:10,760
bothers so so in any OS 10 environment

753
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,379
that's that's always kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a pretty</font>

754
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,410
big issue especially if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

755
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,570
an anonymous<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTP server because a couple</font>

756
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">little lines of code and someone can be</font>

757
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,750
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the root of your volume</font>

758
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,370
they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to change</font>

759
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:28,700
anything but they have complete access

760
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:31,189
so and then rather than use an ftp users

761
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,870
file all the ftp user names and

762
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,360
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> are stored</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> info of</font>

763
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:38,679
course if guest is enabled then that

764
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really doesn't help you very much but</font>

765
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:46,280
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of doing this service by</font>

766
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:50,540
service is that cool or<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

767
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:53,120
quick time streaming um has anyone here

768
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,920
ever tried to intercept streams or do

769
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,510
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that not just for quick</font>

770
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">time but for real right all that stuff</font>

771
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">is pretty freely available for quick</font>

772
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,040
time as well the one nice thing about

773
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,420
about quick time as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL with</font>

774
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:14,090
it which can<font color="#CCCCCC"> help to mitigate that as a</font>

775
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:16,370
risk communications between two OS 10

776
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:20,000
servers running<font color="#E5E5E5"> quicktime streaming are</font>

777
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:22,940
all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear-text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font>

778
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,510
to just sit there where they are with a

779
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,510
hub and TCP dump and the rest is history

780
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:33,560
and I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really given a lot of</font>

781
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought to different ways to attack</font>

782
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,310
quicktime streaming servers a lot of my

783
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,700
clients use it and I'm kind of afraid

784
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:44,960
that if I build something that

785
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:48,799
it'll go bad on me so so frenetic

786
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,839
netboot um netboot is a way to boot your

787
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">mac with tea if any of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have ever</font>

00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:55,339
accidentally held the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tiki down or not</font>

789
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">tea but in the end key down when you</font>

790
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:59,119
boot your computer it's just it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has a</font>

791
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,099
little network logo where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's spinning</font>

792
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,890
and looking for a net boot image to boot

793
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:07,400
off of net boot images have to be stored

794
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in either a tftp server or an open AFP</font>

795
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,450
server so no passwords which means that

796
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily download or boot off of</font>

797
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:19,609
anyone's volume if they're running if

798
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,348
they're running netboot and a lot of

799
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">clients that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see actually have netboot</font>

800
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:25,250
open to the world so even though it

801
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:28,848
would be very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow someone could</font>

802
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:31,480
easily boot off of their server which

803
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:34,010
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is probably never a good idea</font>

804
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,140
you can use open directory to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

805
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,309
mitigate that so that you know you have

806
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a username and password to</font>

807
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:43,160
actually log into the system but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

808
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:45,078
know it's still out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

809
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,779
also use<font color="#E5E5E5"> file bulb with those to kind of</font>

810
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:50,420
make things a little more secure in the

811
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,059
OS 10 world bio bolts is just an

812
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:58,599
encrypted folder that all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data</font>

813
00:35:53,059 --> 00:36:01,910
from your / users folder let's in so um

814
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:05,720
don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put more than 100 nodes /</font>

815
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:08,629
xserve on it yeah I wouldn't definitely

816
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:13,250
not do that I mean you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> four gigs of</font>

817
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:15,940
ram dual core maybe but otherwise

818
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,940
definitely

819
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">I use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> filevault for everything the only</font>

820
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,730
time that I don't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> filevault is if</font>

821
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,720
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an application and compatibility</font>

822
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:34,450
so that it really doesn't seem to slow

823
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,250
down performance because a lot of this

824
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:39,629
stuff like if you're in Photoshop you're

825
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:42,760
you know you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your swap files</font>

826
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,410
for photoshop or stored outside so the

827
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,780
most of the read and write stuff

828
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:49,118
entourage works fine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> filevault a lot</font>

829
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:52,060
of the Adobe products don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

830
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,510
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know pretty pretty</font>

831
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,910
heavily deployed in Mac environments so

832
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,950
I like foul ball to let I mean you know

833
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:05,710
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think i have it turned on in</font>

834
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:08,799
this laptop because it does seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow</font>

835
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,390
it down a little bit but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big my</font>

836
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,380
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with file bolts is that</font>

837
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:16,359
every now and then it wants to compact

838
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,619
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> filevault image you know and then</font>

839
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,330
you're sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for two</font>

840
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,090
hours and there's no cancel button on it

841
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,650
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's like and then if you</font>

842
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:29,260
reboot it it's automatically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

843
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:32,950
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it again so that yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

844
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:35,050
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big fan of that personally so</font>

845
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">images must be stored on servers with no</font>

846
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,730
security I can't i already mentioned

847
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:43,330
that but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean in school</font>

848
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,740
environments it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess it's no big</font>

849
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,569
deal because what's a third grader going

850
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:51,040
to do but you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to</font>

851
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:53,560
companies like you have to you just have

852
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,380
to architecture your network around that

853
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:00,670
concept we were doing some work for a

854
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:03,190
government agency and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't have</font>

855
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:06,850
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> discs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so they had to use file on</font>

856
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,410
they had to use netboot but but they

857
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:11,890
were physically segmented as to which

858
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,080
image you could boot to and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

859
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:17,379
is incredibly bad about hopping across

860
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">be lands you know I'm we see it at big</font>

861
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,040
film studios all the time where you may

862
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,359
work for a company who's renting space

863
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,980
and you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be veal and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font>

864
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:25,779
can't see anything else but you do

865
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,880
because there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an update two days ago</font>

866
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to rendezvous and now it Hopsin does</font>

867
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,010
something new that's kind of weird so

868
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:36,230
so multicast DNS is always fun to play

869
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:40,100
with but rendezvous seems to go a little

870
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:44,770
beyond that sometimes anyways so

871
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:49,430
forensics specific stuff for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac servers</font>

872
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:52,130
before you plug a drive in yeah apples

873
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc arbitration d running in the</font>

874
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,370
background so if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

875
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,700
do forensics on a drive you should

876
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely either use a write blocker or</font>

877
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:05,230
rename this file<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here whoops to</font>

878
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,600
rename this file right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to something</font>

879
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,820
like you know dot old and then either

880
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,560
reboot or kill your<font color="#E5E5E5"> disc arbitration</font>

881
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:18,110
demon and that should that should make

882
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:20,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">it not do that and then you know I guess</font>

883
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:22,550
last year at Def Con there was someone

884
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,460
giving a talk on secure channels and

885
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:29,000
using secure channels to trade credit

886
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,460
card information or something a couple

887
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,020
apples specific file types and I guess

888
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,530
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple specific anymore because</font>

889
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:40,220
itunes are so widely spread now but AC

890
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:42,980
files or definitely have all the same

891
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:48,439
fields that an mp3 file might for

892
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:50,500
example so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you know I'm not gonna</font>

893
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,730
I'm not here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about forensics but</font>

894
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,290
when I have done work like that it's

895
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the second you plug in a drive to a</font>

896
00:39:54,290 --> 00:40:00,230
Mac it rights to it so that's that's

897
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:02,420
never that's never a good thing so some

898
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:07,130
of the tools that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a lot i</font>

899
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,710
mentioned snort I'll deploy snort pretty

900
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:12,380
I probably deployed at least once a week

901
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:14,270
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple servers just because no one</font>

902
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,250
else seems to and like I said it's

903
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:18,170
really easy if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got you can</font>

904
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">download hen wen top version tracker com</font>

905
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,430
it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two minutes to install</font>

906
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,620
and you've got a fully functional

907
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:28,009
version of snort if you want to actually

908
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:33,980
go further and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use snort from the</font>

909
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:37,250
command line then Darwin Darwin ports

910
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:40,630
has it in it as well and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

911
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:44,060
actually CD into the hen wind app and

912
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,290
it's it's located<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think two or three</font>

913
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">subdirectories under that</font>

914
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:51,590
so and then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my book and also i</font>

915
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:54,980
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> on AFP 548 which is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big mac</font>

916
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:56,750
website I the check boxes that work

917
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:01,730
versus the check boxes that don't and

918
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:04,400
stuff like that so so anyways I'm a big

919
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:06,530
fan of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in hand when they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

920
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,710
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guardian perl script that</font>

921
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:13,310
automatically updates your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipfw file if</font>

922
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:15,100
someone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing something to your</font>

923
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,660
system so someone's port scanning me is

924
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:24,170
supposedly will automatically update my

925
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:31,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipfw com file sometimes both it's</font>

926
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:33,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">according</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to who it's for yeah and you</font>

927
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,410
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> even on the server side in an</font>

928
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:39,440
organization with 80 people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no IT</font>

929
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:43,670
staff it's you know some of these snort

930
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,770
options like the trading pornography

931
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,530
feature the snort has and stuff like

932
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:51,680
that will i'll usually disable those for

933
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:54,590
clients because yeah you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

934
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,680
file called porn dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc might be a</font>

935
00:41:54,590 --> 00:42:01,700
script about for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> point or you know</font>

936
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,870
whatever porn clients pay really well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

937
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,000
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if any of you have ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

938
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:08,810
work for them but usually they'll pay

939
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:15,320
anything I t work specifically I'm not

940
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:17,330
there yeah yeah but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to do some</font>

941
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,520
work one time at a post house that

942
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:25,069
solely does porn and if you've ever

943
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:27,440
watched the same scene you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 50 times</font>

944
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:30,230
in a row you just feel gross you know

945
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you're like ah ah you hit her in</font>

946
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:39,890
the act you know it's terrible terrible

947
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:42,319
stuff but but you know it's sad they pay

948
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:45,740
really well and they want everything

949
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:48,410
right then so they have to so I use I

950
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,200
use checkmate sometimes for for tripwire

951
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:53,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">check sounds especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on servers on</font>

952
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">the workstation side I don't i can't</font>

953
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:58,490
imagine really deploying

954
00:42:54,170 --> 00:43:01,700
that you can automatically deployed

955
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,140
tools using apple remote desktop it'll

956
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,060
automatically install package files

957
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:09,080
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> hinman is in a package based</font>

958
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:12,440
installer so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy this to 500</font>

959
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,240
max at the same time which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font>

960
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,260
nice because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know obviously we've</font>

961
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,620
always been able to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

962
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,930
Microsoft servers and you know now with

963
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,279
Linux you can do it as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it makes</font>

964
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:27,109
sense that Apple's kind of following

965
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:29,630
that trend so<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit obviously has I</font>

966
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:34,280
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 15 exploits maybe for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mac</font>

967
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:43,340
that you can run Nessus obviously works

968
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:45,950
for OS 10 yeah but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for I I read</font>

969
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,630
an article I don't know six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

970
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,790
where they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out of the box OS</font>

971
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,770
10 is by far the most secure operating

972
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,930
system around I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well obviously</font>

973
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:56,600
like most<font color="#E5E5E5"> media people this was written</font>

974
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,940
by a mac guy because out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box</font>

975
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,980
that's really OS 10 workstation is quite

976
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:05,360
secure because they don't enable many of

977
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,100
the services i mentioned that in a

978
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:13,750
minute I actually give the link for it

979
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:17,299
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA and yeah um they have a</font>

980
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:21,680
secure deployment strategy so a lockdown

981
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:24,250
strategy it's published yeah i'll give

982
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:28,609
the link in just a minute gosh darn it

983
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:31,460
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I I feel really bad because I</font>

984
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:33,950
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I turned on all my services and</font>

985
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:36,670
I on a default server and I did an SS

986
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:39,350
can against it and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 50 pages</font>

987
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:41,110
but I didn't save the<font color="#E5E5E5"> report properly i</font>

988
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:45,230
guess so i can't show<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to you but</font>

989
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:48,110
necessary is available for 40 s 10

990
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:50,000
server and austin darwin ports is a

991
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:52,100
great place to look for different

992
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,070
updates for binaries so you don't have

993
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:59,299
to build them yourself everything from

994
00:44:55,070 --> 00:45:03,080
GD on<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think i mentioned this yet</font>

995
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:05,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">i do so and then by default all logs are</font>

996
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,710
at low levels but you can turn them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

997
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,940
and there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a program called</font>

998
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,320
consult appt

999
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,520
gives you access to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logs so you</font>

1000
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,560
don't have to go hunting for him because

1001
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,250
none of them are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right place so</font>

1002
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,390
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of frustrating sometimes</font>

1003
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,130
console yeah it's just under

1004
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:23,690
applications utilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's called</font>

1005
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:25,450
console yeah so some some apple kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1006
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:29,720
specific utilities that we use

running right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonjour browser i</font>

1009
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,600
guess i can look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you know</font>

1010
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,120
automatically it's just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out</font>

1011
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">and tell me what services are open on</font>

1012
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,710
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's computers so you know</font>

1013
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:47,180
who else has OS 10 server running

1014
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:48,650
isshikawa anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> sweep I don't see many</font>

1015
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:51,680
people with OS 10 server running on

1016
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:56,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">their ID box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I mean you know it's</font>

1017
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,799
very very rare oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have so also</font>

1018
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:08,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a there's a totally awesome</font>

1019
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:10,730
exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> for X</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an and then you know by</font>

1020
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:13,040
default NEX<font color="#E5E5E5"> in if you if you have X an</font>

1021
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,590
installed and you fiber in you can see

1022
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,029
the root of everything and you bypass

1023
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:22,490
all quotas just by going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1024
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:24,020
metadata which is pretty fun anyways so

1025
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:27,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't really go into that because I</font>

1026
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:30,350
actually have another another thing I i

1027
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,180
did on that but the sub<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bonjour browser</font>

1028
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:33,589
is kind of cool to just see what

1029
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,470
everyone's running on a network really

1030
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,880
quick secure empty trash someone had

1031
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:40,189
mentioned earlier in one of the

1032
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,720
forensics talks I think writing data 20

1033
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:46,940
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know writing zeroes or random</font>

1034
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,120
arbitrary numbers they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros</font>

1035
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:53,090
over it 20 times which you know whatever

1036
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,740
but any when you go to secure empty

1037
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:58,100
trash any of those files they just

1038
00:46:54,740 --> 00:47:01,339
overwrite that that those blocks 20

1039
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:03,500
times so<font color="#CCCCCC"> filevault obviously can slow</font>

1040
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,490
down performance personally I don't do

1041
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> requires a lot of</font>

1042
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:09,350
performance I do most of my work in

1043
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:11,299
terminal so so for me the performance

1044
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">really doesn't matter if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm riding i'll</font>

1045
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:18,050
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use another machine basically</font>

1046
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:21,110
so that's that's a cipher<font color="#CCCCCC"> filevault it</font>

1047
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:23,450
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you're in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mac OS 10 your</font>

1048
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:25,670
users file your users folder and it

1049
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:32,779
turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into an encrypted disk image so</font>

1050
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:43,340
oh I'm sorry yeah it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like EFS</font>

1051
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:49,250
plus I i can't remember that right and

1052
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's encrypted with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think a s 256 but</font>

1053
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:54,880
it's pretty pretty I you know and it

1054
00:47:52,610 --> 00:48:02,180
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bigger it gets the more</font>

1055
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:03,470
issues you might have so right when you

1056
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,859
boot they mounted right to it personally

1057
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:08,720
at home the machine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I right on that</font>

1058
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:12,170
i use for writing and you know from I

1059
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">prong i actually have used a</font>

1060
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,860
concatenated raid on it so to turn the

1061
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,870
machine on you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to insert</font>

1062
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,480
my USB jump drive but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i keep with me all</font>

1063
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:22,790
the time so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean you</font>

1064
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,440
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get pretty pretty crazy and</font>

1065
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:27,590
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine file vaults enabled and</font>

1066
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,430
all the word documents that later become

1067
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:33,920
my books are in those those folders so

1068
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:36,890
so think commander um think commander

1069
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,410
will go through its and install all the

1070
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:41,299
fold all the programs like if you're

1071
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,670
trying to install GD<font color="#CCCCCC"> live or something</font>

1072
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,410
it'll download it install it and install

1073
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> download all of its dependencies</font>

1074
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:52,700
which is kind of cool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of</font>

1075
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:54,470
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to deploy you know one</font>

1076
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,299
package without having to go through all

1077
00:48:54,470 --> 00:49:00,009
the problems that most<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac users can't</font>

1078
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:02,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of figure out squid squid man is</font>

1079
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:05,390
you know if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a friend and for</font>

1080
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:07,850
it chances are most mac shops aren't

1081
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,470
going to deploy it so squid bands are

1082
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:11,569
front end for being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy a</font>

1083
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:16,250
proxy the proxy built into Mac os10

1084
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:19,580
server is just crap so you know squid

1085
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:21,380
man is maybe two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years old since its</font>

1086
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,790
last update and I asked the guy who

1087
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,770
wrote it if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have a source code</font>

1088
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:27,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then I just update it for him and he</font>

1089
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:30,960
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to let go of it so</font>

1090
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:34,440
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I but it is still pretty decent app</font>

1091
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,590
so I wish it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I map s but that's</font>

1092
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:40,650
aside from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so the concatenated</font>

1093
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:43,290
rate thing I already mentioned gpg and

1094
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:46,170
PGP are both available for for Apple

1095
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:47,880
products gpg zan degraded straight into

1096
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:49,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">mail that app I would open my mail that</font>

1097
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,260
app but I think someone here is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1098
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">take my password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that would suck but</font>

1099
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:58,740
it's just same as anything drop-down

1100
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:00,930
list check you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ling on 11 weird</font>

1101
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:02,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing about OS 10 server or OS 10</font>

1102
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:05,640
workstation as they deprecated cron

1103
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:07,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple just didn't they just couldn't</font>

1104
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,850
work within the confines of chron

1105
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,600
anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess because they wanted more</font>

1106
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:14,580
windows style service offerings so what

1107
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,500
they gave us was launched<font color="#E5E5E5"> d which no</font>

1108
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">apple administrator that i know of other</font>

1109
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">than maybe four of us have been able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1110
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,720
actually figure out how to use

1111
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:23,570
efficiently so one of the guys actually

1112
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,160
built this program called<font color="#CCCCCC"> ling on which</font>

1113
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:29,280
which allows you it's basically like

1114
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:36,060
opening the services box and a windows

1115
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:39,120
server so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start stop and add or</font>

1116
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:41,220
remove new services from a GUI and

1117
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,890
launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the how many people here have</font>

1118
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:47,009
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> launched d yeah it's kind of a pain</font>

1119
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:51,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can re-enable cron on an OS</font>

1120
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 bucks but like apples trying to get</font>

1121
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,240
away from it and every update that you

1122
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,370
run is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blow out your update and</font>

1123
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,709
stuff like that and I'm another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1124
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:01,020
about when you update software in an OS

1125
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">tense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> environment you never know what</font>

1126
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">effects that's going to have on the GUI</font>

1127
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,330
so for clients when they want me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1128
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">update them to let's say they're failing</font>

1129
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:13,410
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Essos can because by default OS 10</font>

1130
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:17,279
server uses think open SSL oh 9 7<font color="#CCCCCC"> B or</font>

1131
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:19,440
something so in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than</font>

1132
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,210
actually updating openssl because when I

1133
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,770
tried it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would blow out the GUI and that</font>

1134
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,810
was the clients requirement that they

1135
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,310
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain their GUI I would just</font>

1136
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:31,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">change the headers for it then it would</font>

1137
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:33,750
pass the nessus can so so GUI tools Mac

1138
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:35,009
users love<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and I don't think they're</font>

1139
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:38,910
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use anything without it like</font>

1140
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:41,280
there's a there's a you masks you know

1141
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> define how new files that you</font>

1142
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,390
create

1143
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,430
or have their permissions and what

1144
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:49,120
attributes that different things you do

1145
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:51,339
as a user have there's there's actually

1146
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:54,069
GUI app for that for creating you masks

1147
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:56,740
and stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they get you know</font>

1148
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:59,280
like like I showed even even CH mind has

1149
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:07,299
has a GUI and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 10 which is</font>

1150
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:09,940
kind of kind of wild so what's next more

1151
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:13,900
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is the link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1152
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:16,230
that that NSA white paper for anyone who

1153
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,770
asked about I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think John asked about it</font>

1154
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:22,690
so there's the link right there and I

1155
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:25,360
eldest annoyed last night so he's got

1156
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:28,060
the updated copy of my presentation it's

1157
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:30,100
only missing one screen I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

1158
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">which one it is but I'm sure it's one</font>

1159
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:39,130
that doesn't matter it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

1160
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,690
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a half old almost but but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1161
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:44,070
the same and i think it was written for

1162
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:47,500
10 3 so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not include launch d</font>

1163
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:50,170
but it does offer some pretty basic

1164
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:52,240
guidelines and pretty pretty good things

1165
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:55,990
to do I mean you know if you're

1166
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:58,330
deploying OS 10 as a specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of</font>

1167
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:59,799
server like a ldap server or a web

1168
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:02,440
server it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cover that as</font>

1169
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,270
much as maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could i think i'm gonna</font>

1170
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,040
i'm one of the next books i'm going to

1171
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:08,140
write as OS 10 security and i'll

1172
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:15,850
probably you know reference some of

1173
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:17,049
their material frequently yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

that I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't want to pretend</font>

1177
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,710
I know something AFP 548 a great website

1180
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,730
I've got they've got a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

1181
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,960
backlog of<font color="#E5E5E5"> article so I've got like four</font>

1182
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:45,370
articles that I wrote for them that

1183
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,160
haven't been published yet so they're

1184

you know they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as up to date as</font>

1185
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,690
maybe they could be but secure Mac Mac

1186
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:58,150
security you know sans doute

1187
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:02,680
Orange has I think eight Mac specific

I have 24 machines at home and that's

1223
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:45,879
that's where I do a lot of my testing

1224
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:49,180
and then at my office I've got another

1225

1231
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,900
breaking that specific configuration

1232
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:07,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">until you're actually going easy what I</font>

1246
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:38,799
whatever OS you know and a lot of times

1247
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:40,450
they're really clear they do document

1248
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:42,460
some of their files pretty well ever

1249
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:44,019
since all this plist file conversion

1250
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:47,469
stuff they really aren't documenting

1251
00:56:44,019 --> 00:56:50,919
stuff like they used to or not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1252
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:53,859
a collection of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> at AFP 548 have</font>

1253
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,019
actually started doing kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

1254
00:56:53,859 --> 00:56:59,469
apple doesn't provide knowledge bases on

1255
00:56:56,019 --> 00:57:00,968
what they updated AFP 548 it's actually

1256
00:56:59,469 --> 00:57:03,099
starting to review everything that they

1257
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:04,539
update and then you know say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well</font>

1258
00:57:03,099 --> 00:57:10,539

it definitely works on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows but you</font>

1298
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:57,660
know you need a Cisco device to do it

1299

either running you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know without NAT and</font>

targeting like if you're working

1316
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:46,049
specifically with print shops like we

1317
01:00:44,819 --> 01:00:48,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't take on new friend shops as</font>

1318
01:00:46,049 --> 01:00:50,130
clients anymore because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just don't</font>

1319
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:52,170
don't pay well but if you're if you're
