making enough advances kind of reminds

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,479
me of where firewalls were maybe about

quit your day job just yet what we're

20
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:26,649
going to touch on here is we'll talk a

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,179
little bit about encryption plausible

good tools out there for doing that you

only a matter of time before the bad

66

guys really start using what's available

out there today with encryption to start

68
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,540
covering their tracks we had some issues

69
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">here about a year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so ago where you</font>

know with with some of the tools if you

<font color="#E5E5E5">created an encrypted partition within an</font>

you know statistically proven fact that

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was another hidden partition within</font>

76
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:41,349
away they've dramatically improved the

way they do that and essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

we're showing graphically here you take

nearly impossible now truecrypt is also

<font color="#E5E5E5">I liked about it was kind of cool here</font>

94
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it uses a key file rather than using</font>

95
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,180
a crypto key so it becomes a choice of

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,909
which of the 70,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus files on the PC</font>

97
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,310
did the bad guy use as<font color="#E5E5E5"> his crypto key</font>

98
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:36,610
which I thought was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat again</font>

99

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,020
bit about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vista this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting kind of</font>

145
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,880
interesting I was over in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK about</font>

146
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,510
two weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a lot of talk</font>

147
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,790
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vista thankfully though this the</font>

148
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,710
whole TPM bit is only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used</font>

149
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,270
on two versions the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise version</font>

150
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,159
and then they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this other version</font>

151
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's it's up above enterprise that just</font>

152
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,850
kind of have everything plugged into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

153
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,860
but the bottom line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they're</font>

154
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,560
actually using a hardware crypto chip on

155
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,200
the motherboard itself to store the

156
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,840
private keys the bad guy can then put

157
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,210
his public key on a token he can put it

158
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a USB key etc which is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

159
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,039
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtually impossible for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone to</font>

160
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,770
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break that you know the key</font>

161
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,200
itself now combining that with full

162
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,560
volume encryption I mean all bets are

163
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,450
off

164
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,700
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply no way that</font>

165
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,740
someone who's used windows vista

166
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,659
enterprise and has implemented full

167
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,070
volume encryption you're just not going

168
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that drive it's not going to</font>

169
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,880
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's kind of scary</font>

170
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,560
it's so scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some people in the UK</font>

171
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,710
the government was seating a story about

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows building in a back door to allow</font>

173
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,750
law enforcement to still get at the key

174
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,030
so they could decrypt the drive to run

175
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,100
their forensic analysis on it windows

176
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,469
immediately came out and put out this

177
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,540
big press release about there's no way

178
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,450
in hell we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow a backdoor</font>

179
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,180
in Windows now fortunately for the

00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,909
community at<font color="#CCCCCC"> large it really requires no</font>

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:08,169
effort from Microsoft to provide a

185
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:19,120
system access so chances are it will be

186
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,370
there and surely we can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent or so still yet unpatched</font>

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,390
neat<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft making the statement that</font>

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,839
about steganography I mean how Qaeda is

209
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,600
going to hide their commands for their

210
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,070
next attack inside a porno image or

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,980
something on the web and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,380
on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this it just gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font>

213
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,959
outrageous you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and download a</font>

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">version that also has an encryption part</font>

that goes along with it where you can

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,540
encrypt the data before you store it in

grab that it was kind of fun but

223
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:41,470
somewhat meaningless there are a number

224
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,779
of programs out there that will look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

out there to essentially try to outwit

that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess that by keeping track of</font>

frequency counts they try to keep it a

231
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:02,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more in line to make the data</font>

232
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,219
seem a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more covert will say</font>

233
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,258
tons of other tools freely downloadable

00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:10,959
on the web if you want to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

235
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:13,509
with steganography again it's kind of

236
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,180
neat I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it being used to</font>

237
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:17,769
do anything malicious there was actually

238
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,040
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago somebody went out</font>

239
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:23,740
on usenet and did a survey we're going

240
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,949
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in just a second this</font>

241
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,959
is stag detect again looks at the data

242
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:31,599
itself the randomness of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data to try</font>

243
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,099
to determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> if in fact a specific tool</font>

244
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,579
was used because they all leave some

245
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,620
form of a pattern in the data to try to

246
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:41,109
basically you know let you know that

247
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,540
possibly steganography was involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

248
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,589
the image man I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

249
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,629
more prone to to error than Christ IDs

00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,339
was about five or six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

251
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:56,139
the false positives from this are just

252
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:57,910
absolutely huge but everybody remember

253
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:02,050
these images anybody remember these

images guy gets out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on ABC steganography</font>

is going to destroy<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world here look</font>

at this image embedded within that image

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">was pretty wild it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was all hype though I</font>

mean again getting back to the whole

260
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:18,719
user net bit these guys went out and

261
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,670
actually collected images on usenet

262
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,220
roughly a million of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them they ran</font>

263
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,319
various tools against them to try to

264
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,420
determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> if in fact any of those images</font>

the image as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see roughly about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">20,000 or so images came back as</font>

positive candidates now<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20,000 out of a</font>

269

million not a bad number again this was

270
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,750
done like two years ago looking at the

271
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,509
total data here they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

272

00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:49,510
they ran addiction

274
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,880
very attack against them use the

275
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:55,530
dictionary with roughly 1.8 million

276
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,600
words and phrases didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a single</font>

279
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,350
against I mean that's kind of

280
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,880
eye-opening so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally believe that</font>

281
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> height that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement is</font>

282
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,510
giving to steganography doesn't quite

283
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,510
deserve all the attention time it's

286
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,890
that's specifically mentioned

287
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,290
steganography is being used to hide the

288
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,290
data there's simply easier ways to do it

289
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,950
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know possibly possibly but there's</font>

290
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,410
so many other easy ways to high data I

291
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,150
mean if you know what really<font color="#CCCCCC"> got me was</font>

their whole insistence that well al

Qaeda is using this and they're going to

<font color="#E5E5E5">issue their command for their next</font>

attack using steganography you know the

296
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,060
guy was up on stage talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

on a conference and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just I just can't</font>

00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,930
with that I mean it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> he just rips</font>

301
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:02,319
it apart but yeah possibly but

302
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:05,199
personally doubtful doubtful now one of

303
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,940
the tools i ran across i I've been

304
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,550
buying hard drives on ebay for about

305
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,730
five years now you want to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font>

306
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,920
learning forensics go out to ebay look

307
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,010
for used hard drives now<font color="#CCCCCC"> when someone is</font>

308
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,660
selling lots of hard drives chances are

309
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,670
they're smart enough to have already

310
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,589
wiped the drives<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right they're</font>

311
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,449
selling them in bulk you go for the guy

312
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,460
that's selling one or two drives at a

313
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,010
time all right doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a history</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

314
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,040
selling drives chances are he grabbed it

315
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,020
from a pc at work etc he's selling it

316
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,599
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have some fun with it I</font>

317
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,160
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into naming names and</font>

318
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,260
all that fun stuff because I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

319
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,270
rather not have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay the legal fees so</font>

320
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,680
we'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that I got a hard drive</font>

321
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happened to belong to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Catholic</font>

322
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,290
priest from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Midwest and I found a</font>

323
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,949
lot of instances of this program<font color="#E5E5E5"> on his</font>

324
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:56,469
hard drive now access data has this

325
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,870
wonderful ability to generate word lists

326
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,570
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a full scan of the drive</font>

327
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,790
itself you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also enter biographical</font>

328
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,950
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to brute-force some of</font>

329
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,589
these album manager files he had on the

330
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,300
on the drive had it been kiddie porn i

331
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,460
found i probably would have had to have

332
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,050
reported it but in fact he just had some

333
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,510
wonderful porn that other priests had

334
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,010
been sending to him just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

335
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,780
interesting was fun reading some of the

336
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,670
emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> too because here's this guy</font>

337
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been entrusted to counsel</font>

338
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:27,189
parishioners and some of the emails he

339
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,540
was writing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> his parishioners was was</font>

340
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">just pretty wild so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had a lot of</font>

341
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,920
fun with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in fact if anybody wants to</font>

342
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,020
buy some drives I kind of got a few

343
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,750
hundred I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get rid of at this</font>

344
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,819
point and some of them are quite fun but

345
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,330
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this program what the guy did</font>

346
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,310
here is rather than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know trying to</font>

347
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,640
hide data in pictures he's hiding

348
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,439
pictures with in what looks like data

349
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,270
scanning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for headers on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drive won't</font>

350
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,760
find the pictures all right there

351
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,310
actually encapsulated within this you

352
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,410
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> photo manager and somewhat</font>

353
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,829
encrypted although rather poorly so

354
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,390
again looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the images</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you simply</font>

355
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">won't find them so you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

356
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,710
the tags for the file itself you know

357
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">unfortunately fortunately i guess i</font>

358
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,060
should say is most bad guys are pretty

359
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,190
stupid they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to</font>

360
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,959
run a packer against this they would

361
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,550
simply have it on the drive so

362
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,640
somebody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to find</font>

363
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,199
instances<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this program itself and you</font>

364
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,540
know it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be kind of rough</font>

365
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,700
to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain in court why in fact</font>

366
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:32,280
you're using this period if you're not

367
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:37,660
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give up the passwords sure</font>

368
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:39,850
we'll get into that in just a second now

369
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,290
wiping god this stuff is getting good<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

370
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,780
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i played around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with evidence</font>

372
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:49,000
or so ago they didn't touch the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mft they</font>

373
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,950
did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great job of wiping the file and</font>

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,420
wiping slack but from a forensic

375
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,700
standpoint all you have to do is look in

376
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mft and there's the file name file</font>

377
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,300
size etc etc you knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the guy had</font>

378
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,270
the images of whatever you were looking

379
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,670
for at one time on that pc because it

380
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,680
didn't touch em ft today it<font color="#E5E5E5"> touches</font>

381
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,110
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean this stuff is really</font>

382
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,030
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting good the only forensic</font>

383
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,040
software I'm aware of that even takes

384
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,780
the time to tell who's operating it that

385
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,780
something is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the mft is</font>

386
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,850
smart

387
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,480
you might know the guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote smart</font>

388
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,190
name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andy Rosen he originally wrote</font>

389
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,930
guidance<font color="#E5E5E5"> software's product they kind of</font>

390
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,170
had a parting of ways and he put out his

391
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:29,510
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> lenox</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based product called smart but</font>

392
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,949
he actually examines the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft and when he</font>

393
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,630
sees<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff is filled</font>

394
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,090
with zeros there's a wipe and there's

395
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,530
gaps and data he gives you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop-up hey</font>

396
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,400
it looks like someone may have ran a

397
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,930
white utility on this disk anyway the

398
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,840
capability of this stuff is just

399
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:47,420
phenomenal today I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one I</font>

400
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,260
personally prefer but this one is pretty

401
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,110
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's very well very well done</font>

402
00:16:50,260 --> 00:17:01,850
looking at the specific capability of it

403
00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:04,040
yes not that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware not that I'm</font>

404
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware of not a defrag after running it I</font>

405
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,810
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would still find garbage</font>

406
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,180
within it but again today they do in

407
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:16,429
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> white within the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mft itself it</font>

408
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:18,980
requires a reboot but they do do it well

409
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,690
not today they're actually shifting

410
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,450
stuff around and repacking it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

411
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,100
you'd say it's real good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's</font>

412
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,260
pretty hard to detect very hard to

413
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,669
detect just some of the limited cake not

414
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,350
limited but some of the massive

415
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,930
capability within evidence eliminator

416
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,030
itself it's pretty expensive I mean it's

417
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a cheap program and it's funny</font>

418
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,570
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement</font>

419
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:42,560
they say well the bad guys aren't going

420
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to spend the money on this stuff up you</font>

421
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,590
know well actually actually they are

422
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to steal it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I mean it's</font>

423
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,790
funny any time you find a tool that kind

424
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of does nefarious things being offered</font>

425
00:17:52,790 --> 00:18:00,500
commercially there's always cracks for

426
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:02,090
it I mean loft crack<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay within days of</font>

427
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,100
releasing a new version there's a new

428
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,379
crack for it that's that's just life and

429
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,840
for research purposes only mind you all

430
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,610
always go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and download it it's just</font>

431
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see if it works I mean it it's</font>

432
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,240
amazing absolutely amazing so to think

433
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the bad guys aren't going to use it</font>

434
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost money is crap they are</font>

436
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,840
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for free in fact you know they're</font>

437
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,770
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys they don't mind doing this kind</font>

438
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,050
of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right but now the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

439
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,610
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called cyber scrub I</font>

440
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,309
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

441
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,169
because it's particularly good i like to

442
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:35,000
use it because there's an error<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

443
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,100
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> made encoding it and when you</font>

444
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,040
take the trial where version and you

445
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,379
delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off your pc it doesn't delete</font>

446
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,350
it it just blows away the trial portion

447
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,410
of it you get to use it forever for free

448
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,240
so i use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on all my pcs and no i</font>

449
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't alerted them to the bug yet</font>

450
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,850
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm enjoying using it but again</font>

451
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is incredibly powerfully it does a</font>

452
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,230
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> job of cleaning up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the drive and</font>

453
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:01,850
its really really configurable so if you

454
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,230
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little bit covert about to</font>

455
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,240
use you can only tell it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go after</font>

specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to white you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

to wipe everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if if every</font>

458

time you you go to shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pc you</font>

459
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,130
configure something to automatically

wipe out all of your internet history

461
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,340
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything else chances are</font>

462
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,020
somebody's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out that</font>

463
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,760
maybe he's using a utility on this

464
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,639
machine to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean it up every day after</font>

465
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,559
he uses it with cyber scrub it's fully

466
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,929
user configurable I mean it's incredible

467
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">product get a chance download that there</font>

468
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:32,419
is a trial version out there now it does

469
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,090
go much deeper than others I mean with

470
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:37,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">this program you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually</font>

471
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:41,389
go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> within the PST file and wipe</font>

deleted email that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool that's</font>

473
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:47,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely cool take a look at it</font>

474
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself it is it is very very nice and</font>

476
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:54,200
quite as far or that's quite as

477
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:59,270
configurable as this tool and again it's

478
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:01,130
it's almost free actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 2995 but</font>

479
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,230
I'm one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those guys where years ago</font>

480
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,350
when copy-protection was real big on

481
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,240
software I'd spend 5 grand on tools just

482
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,370
to break a thirty dollar program it's

483
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,710
for the sport of it you guys remember

484
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the old was a card you could buy was a</font>

485
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,240
magnetic transition card would do

486
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,040
magnetic transition copies of floppies

487
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,290
when they were burning the little laser

488
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,540
burns on floppies to get the signature

489
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,918
and all that crap at a four thousand

490
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,600
dollar card that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a magnetic</font>

491
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,030
transition copy cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could break a</font>

492
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,990
thirty dollar program it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great well</font>

493
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:36,049
anyway for 2995 you too can purchase a

494
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,210
copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our wipe and clean does a very</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice job again fully user</font>

496
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,840
configurable and pretty scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

497
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,129
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from a forensics</font>

498
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,840

499
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,929
blow away anything that you could have

500
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,760
possibly wanted on that machine and very

501
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to detect that in fact it had</font>

502
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,690
been run because it truly does use

503
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:55,400
random data for wipes in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's full</font>

the various<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD methodologies to use</font>

506
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,510
it's got its own random white

507
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:06,650
methodologies I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hell of</font>

508
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:08,870
a tool hell of a tool putting out PGP

509
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,840
this was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting video a</font>

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bug in PGP swipe utility it was</font>

511
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,740
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year or so ago where it wiped</font>

512
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,740
the file but didn't bother wiping the

513
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:22,039
file slack which was kind of interesting

514
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,700
and it's got a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem today it will</font>

515
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:27,860
go in and modify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mft but you've got</font>

518
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,510
it and then run it I mean how convenient

519
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that cyber scrub a 2995 program</font>

520
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:40,340
versus PGP which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost you</font>

521
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,899
some big bucks requires a reboot you

522
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,750
don't have to boot off another operating

523
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:48,918
system to clean up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft so PGP is</font>

524
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,480
still kind of out there in being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

525
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,520
really clean up a drive if you're if

529
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,469
it's much easier to use I mean Christ I

530
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:03,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to get PGP to</font>

work again but such<font color="#E5E5E5"> is life now other</font>

signatures whole nother subject we could

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,730
spend an hour talking about signatures

542
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:33,590
now typically in a forensics

543
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,990
investigation you would use signatures

544
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,580
to literally get rid of all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> files</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't care to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,779
creates a full hash set for an entire

those files as being files you don't

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,830
have to bother looking at on the other

look through the drive to see if in fact

do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's great that they're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">finally getting their act together in</font>

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that regard now NIST used to provide a</font>

568
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,320
great set of known good signatures it's

569
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,230
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 bucks a year you get a complete</font>

set of cds they still haven't done DVDs

571
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,499
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really foolish but you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

full set of cds every month and it's a

though and that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> started also add</font>

577
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,469
into the library all of the known bad

00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:53,960
signatures so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now instead of having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

good set of signatures that you want it

<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at it's also going to tag unless</font>

581
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,949
you go in and configure yourself the

582
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,360
known bad stuff along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it so now</font>

583
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,669
instead of known good or known bad

584
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,100
they're just known which is a bit of a

585
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:08,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem and I've tried talking to a few</font>

586
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,340
people would missed about it and they

587
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,110
seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel that they're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

588
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,939
and their government so what the hell

589
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,658
are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do it's a bit of a mess</font>

590
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:20,119
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> access data forensic toolkit they've</font>

591
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:22,999
got a number of their own signatures and

592
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,100
they're also compatible with the NS RL

593
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:27,919
but they allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a little bit</font>

594
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,748
more configuration here if you look in

595
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,970
the the hash set window you can

596
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally click off what types of files</font>

597
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,379
you wish to generate alerts on they've

598
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,049
actually gone through the the NS RL

599
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:40,309
database and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken down in a</font>

600
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,408
manner that you can do some light

601
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,928
filtering with and it allows you to pick

602
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:47,690
and choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to alert on n</font>

603
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:50,389
case has a small collection themselves

604
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,299
it actually does a conversion to import

605
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:54,918
the the NS RL database but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

606
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:58,190
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the granular control you'll get</font>

607
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:01,070
with ftk now signatures are kind of cool

608
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,960
but they're real easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just eliminate</font>

609
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,908
as being a threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your getting caught</font>

610
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,429
doing anything it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really stupid</font>

611
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:09,049
you know again this has to be a bad guy

612
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,779
that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the time to</font>

613
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,259
want to not go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> jail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's as</font>

614
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:16,820
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> as that using a basic hex editor</font>

615
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:19,129
literally going in and changing a single

616
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">character in the file somewhere in the</font>

617
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:24,678
text okay blows away the signature it no

618
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:28,600
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> matches okay it's it's that</font>

619
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:32,629
simple again take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hex editor find a</font>

620
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,049
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of text over here change as I did it</font>

621
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:39,168
was the word this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I changed it to vic's</font>

622
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:41,389
md5 no longer matches right it's not

623
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:43,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to alert on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular file</font>

624
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:45,168
and we'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool in a few</font>

625
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:48,159
minutes that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to blow your</font>

626
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:51,830
minds on how much it can do with this

627
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">but now exec packers what exact backers</font>

628
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,519
do basically is allow you to change the

629
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">signature of the file by literally</font>

630
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:01,190
compressing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right it attaches</font>

631
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,259
itself to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file when you then execute</font>

632
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,970
that file it automatically unpacks it

633
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,429
and ends run you know then runs to file

634
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,379
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fortinet used to</font>

635
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:11,659
hide all that GPL code they didn't want

636
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:16,039
people knowing they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their</font>

637
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:19,369
firewalls<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay literally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you execute the</font>

638
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,769
file it unpacks it file runs take this

639
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,749
use it on any malicious program chances

640
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:25,399
are the antivirus signatures not going

641
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,869
to catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

642
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:28,158
forensics perspective you're not going

643
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:32,090
to have anything that will match up with

644
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,190
it either pretty cool stuff problem from

645
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:37,070
the forensic community's perspective is

646
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:41,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is free and there are tons of</font>

647
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,879
packages out there to do this somewhat

648
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,220
malicious activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean there's not</font>

649
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:49,279
too many good reasons for needing a

650
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,039
packer yes they do provide some degree

651
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,989
of compression so of course if you've

652
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,429
got a small drive etc etc you want to

653
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:57,859
really reduce things down or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

654
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:59,659
all the debug code in a software running

655
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:02,418
a packer on it does make things nice and

656
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:04,580
compact but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does just munch</font>

657
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:06,700
anything that antivirus could find for

658
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,699
it

659
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:16,799
yeah yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep now binders are a whole</font>

660
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:19,190
nother thing binders are really cool

661
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,690
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> first started learning about</font>

662
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:24,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">network security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course I learned it</font>

663
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,649
from the aspect of breaking at first if

664
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,119
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to learn the good on</font>

665
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:28,498
anything you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn to bed that's</font>

666
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,928
why I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot of study on anti</font>

667
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:33,059
forensics I'm learning forensics so in

668
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,070
trying to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the dark side of</font>

669
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:39,570
the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended up downloading a ton and</font>

670
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:41,099
a half of we'll call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> God I don't want</font>

671
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:44,009
to call them hacking tools varner

672
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:45,779
ability assessment tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I downloaded</font>

673
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bunch of vulnerability assessment</font>

674
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,799
tools and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan to hell out of my</font>

675
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,629
box right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I finally got to the point</font>

676
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,129
where I started doing it using VMware

677
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:56,218
because I got tired of rebuilding the

678
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:58,289
box the bottom line is they're using

679
00:27:56,219 --> 00:28:00,269
binders on a lot of this stuff today I

680
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:02,729
mean I've done a lot of conferences

681
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:04,529
where I speak on script kiddie tools and

682
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:06,119
all that fun stuff and I always for one

683
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:08,369
everyone now don't go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home</font>

684
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">tonight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and go downloading these tools</font>

685
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:11,218
or loading them on your corporate

686
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:13,019
network to try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a handle on how</font>

687
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:14,759
they work because chances are you're

688
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,769
bringing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan and with it it's going</font>

689
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be phoning home immediate back door</font>

690
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:21,450
back into your network etc etc binders

691
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:23,099
are pretty cool if you want to play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

692
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,989
binders to get a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle on them I</font>

693
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:29,759
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really neat site Trojan France</font>

694
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:32,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">calm has just an unbelievable number of</font>

695
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,229
Trojan programs and on top of that an

696
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:36,479
unbelievable<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of binders to go</font>

697
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:42,509
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them now surely you guys</font>

698
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:45,599
remember silk rope anybody remember silk

699
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:47,879
rope<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay two or three people silk rope</font>

700
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,249
was the binder that was primarily used

701
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:52,978
with the hell was the name of that old

702
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:54,899
Trojan again<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah back orifice back</font>

703
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:56,609
orifice that was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> such they had the</font>

704
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">best names for everything that went</font>

705
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:02,009
along with that all of the add-ins<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

706
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:04,709
called butt plugs I mean that was it was

707
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:06,539
just cool really cool but silk rope<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

708
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,159
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 was one of the first binders</font>

709
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:10,549
that was made available out on the net

710
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,019
and it was used so that you could attach

711
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:15,418
you know back orifice to other programs

712
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:17,759
so you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a hacking tool all</font>

713
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:21,089
right you would attach back orifice to

714
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:23,220
it using silk rope some bonehead 13 year

715
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:25,230
old is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go to dad's pc and down</font>

716
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,330
this hacking tool or maybe it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

717
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,030
be a tool for viewing porn videos there

718
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,799
was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that used out there too and</font>

719
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:34,470
he would immediately be setting up back

720
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">office on dad's pc right you get that</font>

721
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,460
back channel in a dad's pc seek that you

722
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:42,120
know surf that VPN tunnel into the

723
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,770
office and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have a field bed tons of</font>

724
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,299
binders out there again the difference

725
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,340
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a packer and a binder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Packer is</font>

726
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:49,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply going to lunge up the signature</font>

727
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,389
by compressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright the program</font>

728
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,129
itself a binder is actually going to

729
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,809
combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two programs together so</font>

730
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,789
when you do the install of the one tool

731
00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:00,600
you're actually installing the tool plus

732
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:02,700
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan pretty interesting stuff put it</font>

733
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,010
now metasploit everybody is very

734
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the metasploit project</font>

735
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,510
itself did you know that they have a

736
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,740
full implementation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an anti forensics</font>

737
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:15,299
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vinnie Lou I've talked with my</font>

738
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,919
number of times on email I found some

739
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,900
bugs and some of the tools and he's put

740
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,490
him on his to-do list had a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

741
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">good conversations with him he's a real</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">straight up guy somewhere out in Arizona</font>

743
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:28,770
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's put together a nice set of</font>

744
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:31,470
demonstrations on what possibly could be

745
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:36,059
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an anti forensics environment</font>

746
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:37,919
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the metasploit project one of</font>

747
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:41,100
the more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones is a program</font>

748
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,929
called time stop all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right again these</font>

749
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,178
are you know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just beginning to</font>

750
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:47,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">roll out out there it doesn't use the</font>

753
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,270
uses set file excuse me uses anti query

754
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,789
and empty set information to write the

755
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,980
new times the GUI for it well there is

756
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:03,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">no it's all command line and you tend to</font>

757
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into a little bit of trouble with</font>

758
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,500
syntax he's got like four or five

759
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:10,229
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools out there and each tool</font>

760
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,090
seems to be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different syntax so</font>

761
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,679
what I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the presentation is I</font>

762
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,840
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proper syntax and given you</font>

763
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,950
examples of how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is used so you can</font>

764
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,809
kind of get it right you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

765
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,919
keep emailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vinnie to figure out what</font>

766
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:21,658
the hell<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was thinking when he wrote</font>

767
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing in the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place but it's</font>

768
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:26,669
really pretty cool with with time stop

769
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,429
it's got a number of really interesting

770
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:31,980
options you can choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do single</font>

771
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:34,260
actions like you know last written last

772
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,360
access you know created all that fun

773
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,120
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> to alter the times and then it's</font>

774
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,949
got another

775
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,510
option it's the dash B option we're

776
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:44,890
going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at length in</font>

777
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:49,800
just a minute this is the the specific

778
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,800
syntax<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is incorrect by the way yes</font>

779
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vinnie made a big deal out of it about</font>

780
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using the standard windows interface</font>

781
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:01,090
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for changing it no perhaps there's a</font>

782
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,860
way of you know perhaps there's a way of

783
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,470
somehow figuring out that someone

784
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,449
accessed set file time all right to

785
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,100
change the times on it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

786
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,870
if you know the last command that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

787
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,189
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine was set file time</font>

788
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:16,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">perhaps it's a giveaway I don't know</font>

789
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,190
again I'm a I'm a practitioner I'm

790
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,389
certainly no expert hope nobody thinks

791
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they got an expert up you're</font>

792
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:24,490
talking on the subject I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

793
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:27,129
to brief you on what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned I just</font>

794
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,230
think it's that important again the

795
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,630
syntax is incorrect we do correct it and

796
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:36,190
showing the use of it now this would be

797
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:39,160
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop run against a directory shown</font>

798
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,830
in ft kay well actually this is before I

799
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:46,179
ran it so again if you take note of the

800
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:49,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">timestamps all right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running times</font>

801
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:52,270
stop against that directory reimaging

802
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:55,300
and bringing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back into ftk that's</font>

803
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,190
what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my time stamps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

804
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,428
it kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mudd jism sets them at a</font>

805
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:02,080
fairly arbitrary date but it's a bit of

806
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:03,910
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem this is using an option called</font>

807
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,159
the dash B option it's referred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to as</font>

808
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:07,900
the crag option it catches everything

809
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,120
within the directory and munches the

810
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,190
dates for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole directory so you</font>

811
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,659
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it line by line you can</font>

812
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:17,679
do the entire directory and everything

813
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,570
underlying it so for ftk all of the

814
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,640
dates are now incorrect it's changed

815
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,649
every day to a date that's fairly well

816
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,960
meaningless since they're advanced in

817
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:29,500
time all right that's what 2009 I

818
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,080
believe there yeah yeah Your Honor I

819
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,570
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even working there in 2009 how</font>

820
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,669
can this be correct or not my files<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

821
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">right yeah yes yes yeah which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

822
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:48,640
pretty cool then uh-huh then we get into

823
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">n case n case has a bigger problem with</font>

824
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,500
it yet and Vinny alerted in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

825
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:56,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's well over a year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or so ago here</font>

826
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,580
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have n case prior to running time</font>

827
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,160
stomp again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took the original</font>

828
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,080
partition that we imaged and then I ran

829
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,760
time stamp on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> re image and brought it</font>

830
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into end case take it take a look</font>

831
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:14,350
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens with in case there are</font>

832
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:16,179
no time stamps<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem I</font>

833
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:18,009
heard there's some talk that it will be

834
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">corrected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a future version a new</font>

835
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,700
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> end case was released like</font>

836
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,460
two weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to be quite honest</font>

837
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have time to rerun it</font>

838
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,429
but I most certainly will over the next

839
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,570
couple of weeks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you'll email me</font>

840
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,149
I'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if the problem is</font>

841
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:36,669
still there but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you explain</font>

842
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:39,370
that in court yes you can't which just

843
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:40,569
blows it right out so you know a lot of

844
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point of what I'm getting out here</font>

845
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,500
is we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> better forensic tools all</font>

846
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,939
right you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got maybe three commercial</font>

847
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,590
vendors out there today selling this

848
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,720
stuff you can always fall back to

849
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">autopsy and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all that</font>

850
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,980
fun stuff I didn't bother running it on

851
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,940
that but most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people out there</font>

852
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,040
today are doing point-and-click

853
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,950
forensics they're relying on access data

854
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,560
is ftk they're relying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> end case well</font>

855
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,750
if you are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case case closed this</font>

857
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:13,690
time stamps to tie it to it of course

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and again this is</font>

it as a Craig option it gets every

863
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,230
single file in the directory you'll

864
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,910
notice though that it did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the</font>

865
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:34,210
time stamps on the directories

866
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:36,520
themselves all right again these are

867
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,290
early tools they<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get better</font>

868
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,720
unfortunately or fortunately depending

869
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:45,220
on your perspective but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it is a</font>

870
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,750
major issue now slacker slacker is cool

871
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,689
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know why anybody bother</font>

872
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:52,810
using it what slacker does essentially

873
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,210
is it allows you to hide data in slack

874
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:58,240
space but what's cool about it is not

875
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,070
only will it<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt the data it'll push</font>

876
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,220
it across multiple files within a given

877
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,810
directory which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of neat</font>

878
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,580
literally then you can take a key

879
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,560
the key happens to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> given file</font>

880
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,970
you're not hand entering the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

881
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,330
you give it a file name it uses that

882
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:16,029
file then as the key it<font color="#E5E5E5"> chooses another</font>

883
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:17,890
file to use as a map and then it

884
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,680
distributes all of the data across

885
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,319
multiple files and maintains a map

886
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,120
within another file that you've given<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

887
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,170
very interesting concept but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again if</font>

888
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,049
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide data there's</font>

889
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:32,830
simpler ways to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay much simpler</font>

890
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:35,020
ways to do it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is kind of neat the</font>

891
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,880
syntax<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it was incredibly difficult to</font>

00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,470

894
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,160
figured out that's where we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

bugs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular program he is</font>

897
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,540
release but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course when you get a</font>

898
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,850
copy of the presentation that's the

899
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,980
proper syntax to use to not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only high</font>

900
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:53,950
data given a specific file as a key

901
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,270
given a specific file as a map and by

902
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> map you've got to have at</font>

00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:00,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">least a thousand 24 bytes available to</font>

904
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,950
store the map or it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just blows up so</font>

905
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,799
bear that in mind and again how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull</font>

906
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:07,810
it back out so yeah it's cool but<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

907
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell is going to use it I mean if a</font>

908
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:11,740
bad guy wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hide data there are</font>

909
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:16,330
much simpler ways to do it much simpler

910
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:18,459
ways but now this is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it starts to</font>

911
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:20,880
get interesting they have not released a

912
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,810
copy of this it's called transmogrify

913
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,020
currently being worked on what

914
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:27,460
transmogrify is supposed to do is

915
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,940
automatically on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fly modify the</font>

916
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,950
signatures for a given file set you can

917
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,290
take all of your executables and make

918
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,089
them look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like JPEGs with in any case</font>

919
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,980
you can take whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd like can</font>

920
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,840
make it look like anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and it</font>

921
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,300
supposedly will covertly maintain a

922
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,010
database knowing what it has modified so

923
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,240
that you can go right<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and quickly</font>

924
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,850
change everything back to what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

925
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">is so even if you're looking at the</font>

926
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,710
magic bits or magic bytes within the

927
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,200
file itself chances are they're going to

928
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:59,320
be wrong so as n case or for that matter

929
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything such as ftk goes through when</font>

930
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">you tell it ok I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see every jpg</font>

931
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,350
on this machine because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after</font>

932
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:07,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">a guy to suspect that a kiddie porn if</font>

933
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:10,390
he's run transmogrify you will never

934
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,790
find those JPEGs they may just simply be

935
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,839
Word documents and again they're not

936
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,520
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be flagged because he's</font>

937
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,980
actually gone in and modified those

938
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,490
those magic bites were it actually

939
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:24,400
to be the correct file type<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's</font>

940
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,629
pretty cool he didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me any date</font>

941
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,250
line and when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

942
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,500
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a little bit of blurb on the</font>

943
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,119
website that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming but this is</font>

944
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,700
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blow the hell out of any</font>

945
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,160
forensic tools ability to you know go

946
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,450
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and grab specific file types it's</font>

947
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,210
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a real pain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ass</font>

948
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:44,560
but transmogrify is a pretty cool name

949
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:47,340
too I kind of like that Sam juicer

950
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,710
everybody here I'm sure has used<font color="#E5E5E5"> pwm</font>

951
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:54,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you want to go out and grab a you</font>

952
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,800
know password<font color="#E5E5E5"> set or a hash set out of a</font>

953
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:59,440
Sam file you would use pw dump but it's

954
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,040
noisy noisy as hell now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know why</font>

955
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,720
specifically this is part of the

956
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit framework for anti forensics</font>

957
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,879
it should just be part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

958
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:13,390
framework period but Sam juicer allows

959
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:17,440
you to literally go in and inject code

960
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:19,480
and tell us a SS and you know do the

961
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,820
work of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PW dump without making the noise</font>

962
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,350
that typically surrounds it supposedly

963
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have been able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify the</font>

964
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,400
signatures that would typically be used

965
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,710
with PW dump and alert to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font>

966
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,119
it has been run would Sam juicer there

967
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:36,490
are no signatures so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of cool</font>

968
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,020
again I mean God with the advances that

969
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,790
have been made in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last couple of</font>

970
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,070
years here I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> rainbow tables that</font>

971
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,800
that was fun I mean passwords are

972
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,600
obsolete<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

973
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,040
and they're focusing now and going after

974
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,609
banks with their two-factor

975
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,540
authentication because of the new

976
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:54,069
recommendations that came out we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

977
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,600
banking has to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> to two-factor</font>

978
00:39:54,070 --> 00:40:01,030
authentication by the end of 2006 and

979
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,440
well I'll stay out of your space but the

980
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,420
bottom line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

981
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">being stupid because why go after just</font>

982
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,800
banking if I mean you look at the big

983
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,260
picture anybody who's running<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows is</font>

984
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,690
vulnerable so you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after anyone in a</font>

985
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,340

986
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,380
foolish to think that you can't crack

987
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,050
any windows passwords and typically

988
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">about two hours or less I played around</font>

989
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,770
with rainbow tables myself again for

990
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:26,609
research purposes only mind you I'm a

991
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:31,610
cissp I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prequalify that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

992
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:38,540
created a database it was about do what

993
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:42,350
okay cool yeah hi area<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh-huh there you</font>

994
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:45,580
go I test well yes the bottom line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

995
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:48,259
that i created every letter and number

996
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,900
worked out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four gig fits</font>

997
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:53,150
very very nicely on a DVD and one of the

998
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,860
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> i screw around with this stuff we'd</font>

999
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,390
naturally started using symbols in his

1000
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,400
password because i sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> him back his</font>

1001
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,140
other password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i couldn't crack it</font>

1002
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,270
so i went ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> created the bigger</font>

1003
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,339
file took like five months<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a dual</font>

1004
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,470
xeon server but I've got every letter

1005
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">number and symbol and if I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1006
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:11,509
mistaken it's around 18 or so gig it's

1007
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:14,690
pretty big won't fit on a DVD but fits

1008
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:17,630
very very nicely on my mp3 player so

1009
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:19,220
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still quite portable and in fact I</font>

1010
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,430
understand that somebody's got it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:25,069
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on the net</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and there's a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">package called remote exploit you may or</font>

1014
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:34,430
has a utility<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually works with a</font>

1015
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:37,100
web-based set of rainbow tables files so

1016
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,480
when you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know crack the</font>

1017
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,670
password you don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything</font>

1018
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,040
with you literally just bring in a copy

1019
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,690
of remote exploit on a CD and all bets

1020
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,700
are off you got to have internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

1021
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,190
mind you but again passwords are

1022
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,049
obsolete you know Sam juicers cool but

1023
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:54,290
again there's so many methodologies for

1024
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:58,550
just obliterating a windows network<font color="#CCCCCC"> god</font>

1025
00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:00,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the crazy now future work coming</font>

1026
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:03,560
out of Vincent low in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit and</font>

00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:05,540
a forensics product project ntfs change

<font color="#E5E5E5">provide documentation on the programs</font>

1031
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,859
he's got up there to date which would be

1032
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,300
kind of nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was scratching my head</font>

1033
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,880
for a couple of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to learn</font>

1034
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,740
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with this stuff browser log</font>

1035
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,020
manipulation which will be pretty cool

1036
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,660
especially in light of the presentation

1037
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,670
we heard just a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of minutes ago</font>

1038
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,500
file metadata modification and NTFS

1039
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,770
extend that attribute work so again

1040
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,930
metasploit anti forensics project

1041
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:34,880
definitely worth a look very very good

1042
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,440
stuff currently out there and it looks

1043
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">like some pretty good stuff coming</font>

1044
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,110
through now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's funny when I did this</font>

1045

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the cybercrime conference had</font>

about three quarters of the content I've

keep my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name the hell offer this thing</font>

1050
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,690
just leave it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit project</font>

1051
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,069
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty funny because</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sachin Lou but now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced anti</font>

1055
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:04,470
forensics this stuff quite honestly gets

1056
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:05,940
a bit above my head but I thought it was

1057
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting and I thought I'd point it</font>

1058
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,740
out to you there's supposedly something

1059
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,829
out there called mas death anybody heard

1060
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:17,729
of it stands for most<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely allows</font>

1061
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:20,369
you to literally compile retarget ball

1062
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:23,009
position independent code that will run

1063
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">within let's say a buffer overrun so you</font>

1064
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:26,279
can generate this code that will run

1065
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,619
within the buffer overrun<font color="#E5E5E5"> so nothing</font>

1066
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:30,180
ever has to hit the hard drive that's

1067
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,619
kind of cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hit the hard</font>

1068
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,288
drive there's really no evidence that it

1069
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:36,960
ever ran don't know enough about it to

1070
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:39,410
play with it myself but there you go

1071
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,000
take a look at it it looks pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font>

1072
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:45,029
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to write code that will run</font>

1073
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,329
within an exploit addressed self is

1074
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:50,190
pretty cool URL is there and again I'll

1075
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:51,450
most certainly get you guys to copy the

1076
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,759
presentation so you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and take</font>

1077
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,129
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it that is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be another</font>

1078
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:57,990
defining moment with in forensics no

1079
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:59,819
longer having to touch the hard drive to

1080
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:04,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the exploit on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine is pretty</font>

1081
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:09,029
cool now on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lennox side there are</font>

1082
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:12,930
tons of tools rune FS ability to high

1083
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:14,880
data within bad block I notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> waffen FS</font>

1085
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,420
system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually pretty cool this</font>

1086
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:26,038
I have played with I was screwing I was

1087
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:29,279
up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York and the guys from smart</font>

1088
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,299
and eros and had a class going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on up</font>

1089
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:31,740
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we met and had a few drinks</font>

1090
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:33,299
and I gave him an image with a spoof

1091
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,089
journal file and he really had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

1092
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:39,240
it a second look to be able to catch it

1093
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:41,670
but it is pretty cool k YF s<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love the</font>

1094
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,109
names on this stuff too heids data null

1095
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,130
directories well you know if you're

1096
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:47,369
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something in an old</font>

1097
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:50,759
directory why not call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> KY most people</font>

1098
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:52,619
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway datum you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi data in</font>

1099
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:54,420
reserve space in other words hiding data

1100
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:57,210
in space that forensic tools aren't

1101
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,470
going to look in I mean this stuff has

1102
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,140
been out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for years</font>

1103
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,509
and the forensic<font color="#E5E5E5"> product vendors are not</font>

1104
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,220
addressing the issues so again hopefully

1105
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,420
my speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is going to help maybe</font>

1106
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's going to spark somebody to start</font>

1107
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,740
writing better tools or at minimum start

1108
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,540
harassing these guys that are writing

1109
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,979
the tools to you know hey this stuff is

1110
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,790
out there maybe you want to consider

1111
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:20,940
doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little something about it but</font>

1112
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:23,480
now in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion for the little track</font>

1113
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,920
here on anti forensics is a little quote

1114
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,630
actually found this on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web gave it a</font>

1115
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,910
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a modification but I</font>

1116
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,740
sincerely<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe this today the tools</font>

of malicious system activity I mean if

we don't do something and do something

<font color="#CCCCCC">what we we call forensics today is going</font>

1126
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:53,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get thrown right out the window these</font>

1127
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:55,618
guys are getting just<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk I mean the</font>

1128
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,750
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> are definitely out there to wreak</font>

1129
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,340
havoc with the investigator and again

1130
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,650
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to call literally anything</font>

1131
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,420
they can do questionable you know

1132
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:05,700
there's enough slime balls out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on</font>

1133
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,750
the the opposite side of the coin here

1134
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are going to be bringing these</font>

1135
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,339
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> into court you know hey there's a</font>

1136
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,140
possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this tool was used and</font>

1137
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:15,299
my client<font color="#E5E5E5"> really didn't put those files</font>

1138
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,790
on that pc you know what is it the

1139
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:20,880
Trojan defense been used successfully

1140
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:24,109
here in the US a couple of times it's

1141
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">just amazing amazing and with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

1142
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:29,460
wrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up I hope you found it</font>

1143
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,230
interesting and informative and if you

1144
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:36,080
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions I'll be be happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1145
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">give them a shot yes no questions cool</font>

1146
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right cool</font>

1147
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,399
well my position on it is somewhat maybe

1148
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:58,250
it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> light wait for you here</font>

1149
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,990
but where I came from on this was you

1150
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,940
know I'm at this law enforcement

1151
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,560
conference it was Secret Service down in

1152
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,930
Miami and they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making this</font>

1153
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,609
absolutely huge deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean everybody's</font>

1154
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:09,529
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> al-qaeda to everything</font>

1155
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:10,640
today and they were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> convinced that</font>

1156
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:13,340
al-qaeda is going to be using

1157
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,080
steganography to issue commands to their

1158
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:17,690
operatives and we've got to buy the

1159
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,490
tools now to try to thwart the use of

1160
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:22,010
steganography and I just didn't buy into

1161
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:24,020
it so yeah possibly you know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1162
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,609
great tool it's a great way to go but

1163
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,990
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole push that the Secret</font>

1164
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,710
Service was giving was just to be

1165
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally unwarranted</font>

1166
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,880
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

1167
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:47,520
encryption there is no difference there

1168
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">really is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no difference I mean done</font>

1169
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,210
right it would be totally undetectable I

1170
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:52,710
fully agree with that but my whole issue

1171
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:54,480
was that you know you got these guys

1172
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:56,490
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Miami</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are literally going</font>

1173
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a new industry for software</font>

1174
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:02,040
programmers to write anti steganography

1175
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,480
programs and it's as bad as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1176
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,700
we have at airports today I mean it's

1177
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">completely useless absolutely useless</font>

1178
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,509
you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all safe from old ladies</font>

1179
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:11,760
with knitting needles all right but

1180
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:13,170
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all we're safe from I think</font>

1181
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,780
steganography is going down the same

1182
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:17,460
road I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1183
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,650
steganography has a field wonderful

1184
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">great tool it's got great potential but</font>

1185
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,910
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a juice for</font>

1186
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,140
malicious purposes by<font color="#CCCCCC"> al-qaeda and I</font>

1187
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:29,299
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand why they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1188
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:32,009
going so nuts about it other questions

1189
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:35,310
there you go they go I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what</font>

1190
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:37,050
I I was at a presentation in Myrtle

1191
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:39,120
Beach I was doing a firewall track<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1192
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:41,070
Marcus actually did a presentation in

1193
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,190
front of all these three letter guys

1194
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:46,680
this is a healthy name of it nails god

1195
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,500
it's a forensics and security summit in

1196
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,549
Myrtle Beach it's there every year

1197
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,960
forget the name of it off the top of my

1198
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:54,150
head<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's it's all these guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1199
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">make their living through Homeland</font>

1200
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,420
Security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Marcus spent an hour just</font>

1201
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,430
bashing the hell out of Homeland

1202
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,960
Security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line is all it</font>

1203
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:05,419
did was fatten up everybody's budgets

1204
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:08,760
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really getting no benefit from</font>

1205
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,870
exactly exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I had talked with a</font>

1206
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,940
friend of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine he's with the Secret</font>

1207
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:13,440
Service<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't John but one of the</font>

1208
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,660
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works for John and he's</font>

1209
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,400
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their emphasis on white</font>

1210
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,609
collar crime has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut in half in the</font>

1211
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">last year you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and they're having to</font>

1212
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:24,390
concentrate so much of their effort on

1213
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,830
you know cyber terrorism and terrorism

1214
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,450
in general that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1215
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:31,790
resources to investigate<font color="#CCCCCC"> white-collar</font>

1216
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:31,790
crime so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just amazing</font>

1217
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:39,910
and now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time to play I guess</font>

1218
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:41,140
right there you go maybe now is the time

1219
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,700
to roll out the tool we just talked

1220
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:46,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a couple of minutes ago okay cool</font>

1221
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,049
any other questions

1222
00:49:55,850 --> 00:50:01,880
for primary partition partition table

1223
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:04,820
accomplish that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remove</font>

1224
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:09,430
osm preschool partition table as both

1225
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,430
silly as that was a confident

1226
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:14,070
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though it did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to</font>

1227
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,670
explore these data and dial system

1228
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:19,350
skewer the presence of a partition on

1229
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">the drive itself yeah again</font>

1230
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,759
unfortunately a lot does the major

1231
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:26,899
commercial rental packages don't look

1232
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">your data or don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vote for partitions</font>

1233
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,640
yeah well Andy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rosen with smart he had a</font>

1234
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that if this</font>

1235
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,150
thing in New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he went ahead</font>

1236
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:37,788
and created the partition table made a

1237
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:40,309
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of manual entries to it and it</font>

1238
00:50:37,789 --> 00:50:42,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">was part of the practical that the</font>

1239
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:43,579
students were supposed to do was to run

1240
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:45,759
through this image and they were

1241
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:47,960
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> return a report to Andy and</font>

1242
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,020
farmer dude the guy that always helps

1243
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,460
Andy out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what Andy didn't want to</font>

1244
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,200
happen was have these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> take these</font>

1245
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,839
images and go back to their offices and

1246
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,868
run ftk on him which is point & click or

1247
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:02,450
run run<font color="#E5E5E5"> n case on him so he chose to</font>

1248
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:05,240
format the partition in a manner that ft

1249
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:07,520
K&N case couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even see it couldn't</font>

1250
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,589
you know you couldn't boot it yet his

1251
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:15,230
program would so yeah that was done

1252
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:17,808
manually in his case oh yeah yeah yeah

1253
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:20,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">and again my whole point here is that</font>

1254
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:21,529
the providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tools that we've</font>

1255
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,049
got out there today commercially just

1256
00:51:21,529 --> 00:51:26,059
aren't addressing these issues I mean

1257
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:28,009
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> vineet old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> n case well over a year</font>

1258
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago about the problem with the time</font>

1259
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:32,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">stamps and to date I haven't seen a</font>

1260
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:35,569
resolution to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's like they're</font>

1261
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:38,839
just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing it not hearing any</font>

1262
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:41,980
other questions well cool in for me

1263
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:41,980
that's a wrap thank you very much
