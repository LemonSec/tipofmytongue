1
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,730
and told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me they were going to be</font>

2
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:49,530
thank you well hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody what I'd</font>

3
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to do here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is give everyone through</font>

4
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,890
the course of this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so Oh am</font>

5
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:02,790
I am i loud enough can people hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in</font>

6
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:04,559
the back no what I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is over</font>

7
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,929
the course of the next hour so give you

8
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,360
all an introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> to digital forensics</font>

9
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a procedure point of view and as</font>

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,880
mr. Henry put forward the field is has a

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,490
lot of software in it that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,110
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal to resist forensics but most</font>

13
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,820
of the time when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're dealing from a</font>

14
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,119
professional standpoint with forensics

15
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,460
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with well corporate</font>

16
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,320
collar types where where they don't know

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,550
what the tools are out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,279
usually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty good chance of</font>

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,039
finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> some good data so we'll try to</font>

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,780
cover that and of course a couple of

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,630
introductory notes there's a lot that

22
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,070
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through so please feel</font>

23
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,720
free I'm going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this live and</font>

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,850
available so you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,950
download this from the layer one site so

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,630
if if you have any questions also please

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,760
hold them to the end so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,130
topics that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover here the</font>

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,600
ones to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on are the ones in bold so</font>

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,600
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a conceptual</font>

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,490
introduction of forensics go through

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,610
briefly a slide or two on the anatomy of

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,669
malice which talks about the anatomy of

34
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,070
an investigation digital evidence

35
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,929
forensic procedure which is where I

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,239
spend most of my time forensic tools and

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,769
techniques just some tools to basically

38
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,810
have you look up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us know</font>

39
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,370
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run man and so between the</font>

40
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,260
internet and man you've got a pretty

41
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">good shot of finding out how these tools</font>

42
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,850
work and how powerful they are a brief

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,010
section on counter forensics which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

44
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,329
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> glaze through friends at hardening</font>

45
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,768
for the corporate types you want to

46
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,140
protect their systems and some further

47
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,580
educational resources by the end of this

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,208
hopefully all of us can become digital

49
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,359
proctologists

50
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,349
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> definition of forensic science</font>

51
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:45,840
it's the use of science and<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

52
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:48,268
<font color="#CCCCCC">to investigate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and establish facts to</font>

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,709
facilitate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decisive action which means</font>

54
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:53,549
there has to be a plan and a procedure

55
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,260
to it also an argumentative exercise now

56
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,299
this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem funny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but in reality</font>

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,399
forensics is the art of challenging

58
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:01,230
thing so it is it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something of the</font>

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,469
debate team so to speak a forensics team

60
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,969
is a debate team<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in digital</font>

61
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,290
forensics the subject of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

62
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,180
investigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be digital</font>

63
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,019
data data storage systems are where

64
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,409
you're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking and of</font>

65
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,120
obviously evidential discovery so a

66
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,760
couple of critical distinctions I'd like

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,579
to make first is forensics versus

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,560
security security in a sense is anti

69
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:25,349
forensics so the more secure your system

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,629
is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality the less vulnerable it is</font>

71
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:29,909
so to speak to forensics so forensics

72
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,268
facilitates discovery where<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

73
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:35,280
from that point of view resists it vital

74
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,199
versus<font color="#E5E5E5"> post-mortem versus recovery</font>

75
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,480
forensics where vital forensics happens

76
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,760
on a live system it's dynamic they're

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,349
evolving the frightening piece here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,500
that you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> against time time is</font>

79
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">your enemy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> post-mortem forensics you</font>

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,069
have more time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your side but as the</font>

81
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,900
tools are getting more advanced and as

82
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,659
cryptography is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into play and</font>

83
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,739
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have encrypted file systems you</font>

84
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,209
don't have as much time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

85
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,549
post-mortem discovery and vital

86
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,470
discovery is far more it usually

87
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,359
provides far more insight into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a system</font>

88
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,449
in its attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's obviously</font>

89
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,459
recovery which isn't also<font color="#E5E5E5"> an element the</font>

90
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,379
last distinction is<font color="#CCCCCC"> archaeology versus</font>

91
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,479
geology this is a term<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've borrowed</font>

92
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,939
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan farmer from the corners of the</font>

93
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,799
coroner's toolkit where archaeology

94
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,389
studies the direct effects of humans and

95
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:24,090
geology studies the effects of

96
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:25,380
autonomous systems so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first piece to</font>

97
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,750
being a forensic<font color="#CCCCCC"> investigator is</font>

98
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,460
discovery seizure and preservation so

99
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,409
from a discovery point of view there's

100
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,599
the discovery of raw data both in vital

101
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:35,370
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> post-mortem forensics electronic</font>

102
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">surveillance there's seizure and</font>

103
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,669
preservation so to borrow the term from

104
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,710
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 through the abstraction layers</font>

105
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:42,960
you want to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the lowest level</font>

106
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,460
possible so analyzing a bit stream is

107
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,039
usually far more productive than looking

108
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the actual application data from</font>

109
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,969
volatile to non-volatile so this will

110
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,900
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about later in terms of order</font>

111
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:54,330
volatility

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,008
knowing the geological terrain so for

113
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,780
example it's critical that you know how

114
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:00,060
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux system works or how your</font>

115
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,369
window system works how the NTFS file

116
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,039
system really stores data you know what

117
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,780
are these what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these metadata that's</font>

118
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,729
stored along with files<font color="#E5E5E5"> like file names</font>

119
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,280
and file times and what does all this

120
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:13,680
mean avoiding<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware and documenting</font>

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,299
everything recognition of digital

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,949
evidence is also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibility of</font>

123
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,630
an investigator you have to be able to

124
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:21,840
identify it and chain of custody which

125
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,990
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit later duplication</font>

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,820
distillation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and conversion now as we'll</font>

127
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,860
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about later in the evidence section</font>

128
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,289
following industry standards is a really

129
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,370
important thing this is what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

130
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,139
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define whether or not a</font>

131
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,270
court accepts the evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you put</font>

132
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,400
forth so duplicates must support

133
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,020
independent verification duplicates must

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,659
be tamper proof and to quote the federal

135
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">rules of evidence if data are stored in</font>

136
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,410
a computer or similar device any print

137
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,210
out or other output readable by<font color="#CCCCCC"> site</font>

138
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,060
shown to reflect the data accurately

139
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,370
isn't original this<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically mean this</font>

140
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically facilitates digital evidence</font>

141
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,160
and then conversion both for analysis

142
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,080
and representation analysis and

143
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,360
reporting finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the who what where</font>

144
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,680
when why and how finding the needle in

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,880
the haystack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then being able to</font>

146
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,590
report on it expert testimony being

147
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,050

take your your course with forensics was

207
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,090
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the target or merely an instrument</font>

computer just 11 stepping point for

212
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,870
example print servers used to be very

common as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> entry point for for attacks</font>

214
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,250
so if you're investigating a print

219
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,939
you can determine that it wasn't

220
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,930
premeditated then you usually have more

221
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,500
options because there's more

222
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:45,050
carelessness to deal with so evidence to

223
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,089
quickly gun through this primary

224
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,740
evidence is supportive evidence counter

225
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,779
supportive evidence and controversial

226
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,060
evidence all of which are very important

227
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:55,040
if you don't have evidence and counter

228
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,930
supportive evidence saying so the first

229
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">question says this is evidence that it</font>

230
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,800
happened this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is evidence to support</font>

231
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,450
that it didn't happen this way or this

232
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,740
way or this way that it did in fact

233
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,690
happen this original way and then

234
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,240
controversial evidences evidence that

235
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,560
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure what to make of</font>

236
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,490
secondary evidence is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that of discovery</font>

237
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,619
or destruction

238
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">either concealment fabrication forgery</font>

239
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,510
and then the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of evidence</font>

240
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">are fossilized artifacts or residual</font>

241
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,970
evidence so then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a questions of</font>

242
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,619
government what are the objectives of

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,140
ruled that digital evidence is not

297
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,740
considered hearsay because it's a direct

it's a result of machine storage and one

314
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,420
your evidence probably doesn't belong

either to the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you requested</font>

that you find it or the courts and the

00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:00,830
courts won't accept it you'll have no

318
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,390

319

00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,810
follows that then it can be admissible

365
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,550
but as I said before it's usually a good

366
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,699
idea to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry-standard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools that</font>

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:13,930
when a quick aside here the key to

interesting tidbits Peter<font color="#CCCCCC"> gutman wrote</font>

393
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,110
some amazing articles and if you go to

394
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vico site you can actually see</font>

398
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,830
magnetic residual so that if for some

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,540
reason you happen to have an electron

400
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,370
scanning microscope in your basement you

401
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,290

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,850
into the interesting part collection so

407
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,010
again you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go for first layer</font>

408
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,750
collections data preservation integrity

409
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,340
and documentation or all challenges that

410
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,920
you have to remember and that will equal

411
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,050
your evidence viability and then there's

412
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,459
contamination challenges there's normal

413
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,229
deterioration that the system is going

414
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put on the system or on the on your</font>

416
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,610
it will overwrite files by allowing that

unallocated state that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are space to be</font>

418
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,550
used examination contamination in simply

419
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,130
doing a directory listing for example on

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,330
there system malfunction negligence all

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,010
of the rest of the stuff tamper we're

426
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,500
both user and<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel I'll just talk</font>

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,210
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just briefly the user space</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">while in the form of replacing</font>

executables the root kits and also

431
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,620
replacing libraries but there's some

432
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,140
very neat stuff in the kernel world

433
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,850
where people will replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-level</font>

434
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,350
right calls so they don't need to

435
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,910
replace the libraries and some of the

436
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,190
root kits can't detect this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

437
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,800
kernel level so something to pay

438
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,480
attention to such for example I've seen

439
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">people bitten by the fact that sink</font>

is think big so think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Enterprise don't</font>

memory tools do that unfortunately and

508
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,590
then there's whether or not you think

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,629
the evidence is anticipated to be

510
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,679

511
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,160
with your stories and then move to the

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,930

522
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,820
really provide you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,840
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just</font>

527

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,730
there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of process</font>

530
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to download and install some tools</font>

531
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,840
which we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little bit</font>

532
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,110
later but there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why this talk</font>

533
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,899
tends to be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lin eccentric and then</font>

534
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,790
the mechanisms finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> your method of</font>

535
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,290
access there sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> alternative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

536
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,670
you want a lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> level read you might be</font>

537
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,770
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it from a direct approach</font>

538
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,960
except the problem is direct reads tend

539
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,860
to be far more difficult and then raid

540
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,870
captures so look at your logical<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks</font>

541
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,750
document the scene contain your scene

542
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,040
now one quick moment I'll mention here

543
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,830
before and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'll just let you</font>

544
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,659
guys read this on your on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own but</font>

545
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,030
one thing to mention is that turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

546
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,340
a machine used to be the old old mindset

547
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,899
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know immediately pull the plug and</font>

548
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,149
secure your environment but that no

549
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,780
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily applies because for</font>

550
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,480
example in the case of encrypted

551
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,430
file systems or loopback file systems if

552
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,020
the machine is on most likely the

553
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,330
encrypted file system is mounted and you

554
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,340
have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the data so if it's not</font>

555
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,990
mounted any longer because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> power it</font>

556
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">off the box now you're in a situation</font>

557
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,390
where you have to crack the data so

558
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,920
capture the data and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll let you</font>

559
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,510
kind of follow this but one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

560
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,360
to point out<font color="#E5E5E5"> is try to get as much</font>

561
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,460
information as possible so running d

562
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">message or the equivalent you know using</font>

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">dr state is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also imperative before you</font>

565
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,000
do your imaging and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> safe synchronized</font>

566
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,830
the memory to disk document everything

567
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so here are some examples of some of</font>

568
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,669
the fields you might have in in a

569
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,679
spreadsheet that keeps track<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

570
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,240
evidence evidence needs to be carried

tracked all the way through whose hands

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's in and whose hands it moves through</font>

573
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,570
fingerprint your capture secure the

574
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,610
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let you</font>

575
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,939
guys cover this on your own this is an

576
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,100
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> collection just to again</font>

577
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,920
i'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys read this off offline</font>

578
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,040
but this is a secure capture so it's a

579
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,750
capture to an encrypted file system and

580
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:29,280
it grabs everything that's easily

581
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:31,260
accessible through the system so another

582
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,850
site is on surveillance establishing

<font color="#CCCCCC">it like a very granular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ids and absolute</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to protect their data so for example a</font>

for deleted data interleave data set so

630

looking at things like steganography and

looking at things like deniable

reconstructing a timetable there's some

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,629
interesting techniques for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

farmer in his in one of his articles

649
00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:01,850
referenced that there's a DNS time to

650
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:04,070
live and through examining examining the

651
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,580
DNS TTL you might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine</font>

652
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,230
when a person accessed a domain so for

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet investigations this can be very</font>

654
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,039
interesting and then obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

655
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">system looking at the modified access to</font>

656
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,210
change times and then the windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mase</font>

equivalent and journal entries trace and

658
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,200
file log analysis and then there's a

659
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:22,070
contextual analysis aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where</font>

660
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,659
you're actually trying to figure out

661
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,750
what the data means you've reconstructed

662
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:28,669
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time table there's a common analysis</font>

663
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,440
using things like strings for example to

664
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,809
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine what the file has in it</font>

665
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,399
identifying it using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> file commander</font>

666
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,649
looking at the magic values of the of

667
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:40,399
the file and then there's tools specific

668
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:42,139
to the applications there's application

669
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:44,449
analysis a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here to</font>

00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention this is malware analysis the</font>

671
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,970
you want to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

672
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,070
figure out what the program is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

673
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,540
decompiling it looking at the strings

674
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,939
these are things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to</font>

675
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,560
approach but the key here is

676
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,140
establishing an environment that secure

677
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,899
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example the lowest level of</font>

678
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,640
protection is using a chroot environment

679
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,200
now the dangers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of chroot an environment</font>

680
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,330
are your file system is the only thing

681
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,310
that's being protected memory everything

682
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,409
else provides pathways back into the

683
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:12,470
file system because you're not fully

684
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,180
separated a virtual machine like<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware</font>

685
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,620
is better but it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font>

686
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's exploits that have</font>

687
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently demonstrated that VMware</font>

688
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,820
applications can actually get past the

689
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,620
VMware jails the best is to have a

690
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,080
dedicated machine that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> isolated and</font>

691
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,840
then establishing a framework for for

692
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,669
analysis so process analysis having a

693
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,350
kernel and library subversion so you can

694
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,760
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually what the process is doing</font>

695
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,219
and then there's some neat censored

696
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,750
execution that will notify you if

697
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,750
something in particular as being done

putting together good presentation some

policies and procedures again doing

at MD 5 it I emphasize here by the way

that knowing pearl is a real benefit and

then some interesting Linux locations

alternative to using LS some people type

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:21,289
compromised so echo dot star or star a

00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,629
lot of rootkits don't don't replace echo

773
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:27,049
and even if they did you're dealing with

00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,480
you could pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DD without those your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">friends at capture can be greatly</font>

compromised if it has a block read error

791
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:06,889
DD will naturally stop that's not

792
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:08,450
necessarily what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you wanted to</font>

793
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:10,609
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second piece to that</font>

794
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,929
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the sync option and</font>

795
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:14,210
what the sync option does

796
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,429
is it buffers out that full block in

797
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,990
zeros so that offsets are no longer

798
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:20,240
affected so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do a full</font>

799
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,740
capture of a drive including all of the

00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:30,259
mount specific pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that but if you</font>

804
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,549
don't do the sync option you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

805
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:34,960
the benefit of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mount it</font>

806
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:34,960
because all the offsets will be off

807
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,350
interesting find line with lots of

netstat is of course very important to

very very important tools some of the

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,139
one of the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention here is mem</font>

00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:54,649
capture of memory for example just

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,149
looking at for example dev mem doesn't

844
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:58,939
necessarily help you because the memory

845
00:30:56,149 --> 00:31:00,649
is not contiguous memba comma dates that

846
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,389
at least in best way it can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> peek at</font>

847
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:04,549
will actually allow you to dump the

00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:05,990
memory of a running process now the

849
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:07,460
interesting part about that is as you

850
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,929
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what now where might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing or</font>

851
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,580
you can see what memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's what's</font>

868
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:43,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">easier to use and some of the tools that</font>

869
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,139
they've that they've added are for

870
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:46,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">example the autopsy forensic browser</font>

00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:50,478
sleuth kit so that makes it all

873
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:52,609
graphical so that brings the sleuth kit

874
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the world of something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

just to mention from the commercial

unfortunately I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you know an i and</font>

880
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,979
and mr. Henry earlier described how it

doesn't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> find everything you</font>

00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:29,629
really interesting cell and PDA seizure

890
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:30,649
tools that paraben offers so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

891
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:32,748
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll mention here a</font>

00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:46,009
application layer what's happening to

898
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:49,700
let is a cookie analyzer building a

899
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:50,839
forensic toolkit so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first bit to</font>

900
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,299
this is building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ruggedized</font>

905
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:04,129
I'll just kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone through this and</font>

906
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:07,009
let you let<font color="#CCCCCC"> you discover this on your</font>

913
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,479
to account for them all so unfortunately

914
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually you have to turn to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick a quick list of</font>

920
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:36,499
forensic bridges so things like white

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your possession</font>

924
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,209
using a write blocker will allow you to

they also make some adapters so<font color="#CCCCCC"> etienne</font>

some debate as to whether or not white

deniable encryption is something that's

1014
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,930
very interesting and it usually comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:35,780
forensic hardening I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

1082
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,690
for a moment security by design<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1083
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,220
practice so identify past present and

1084
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,470
future vulnerabilities in your system so

1085
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:46,129
scan your system some network security

1086
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:49,939
things to mention firewall<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids IPS so</font>

1087
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:52,100
prevention fold failover load balancing

1088
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,320
is interesting because there's different

1089
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,880
ways of having non homogenized networks

1090
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,860
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know yeah redundant non</font>

1091
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,590
homogenized architecture which gives you

1092
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:02,450
which gives you the ability to prevent

1093
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,320
further access to other machines so if

1094
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,730
you're storing<font color="#E5E5E5"> data across multiple</font>

1095
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,370
machines and the machines aren't

1096
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:08,690
homogenized that can be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing to</font>

1097
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,880
protect yourself now remember this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1098
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:13,010
not so much anti forensics as it is

1099
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,350
hardening your system so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font>

1100
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,910
resist forensics for both both so it can

1101
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:19,390
resist it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also so it makes it</font>

1102
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:23,029
available in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a controlled way for your</font>

1103
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:26,540
so data security external demilitarized

1104
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,950
logging so again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1105
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're forensics is heading is</font>

1106
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,939
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing post-mortem analysis</font>

1107
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:34,970
the industry is moving towards more live

analysis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to deal with live</font>

1109
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:37,879
analysis means you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have more</font>

1110
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:39,589
data available so it's more in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">preventative area once again being</font>

1115
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,280
demilitarized logging having things like

1116
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,560
trip wire running on your system so you

1117
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,329
have those Mac times preserves of

1118
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,430
something all of a sudden changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:12,410
interesting so demilitarized system

health management the nagios project is

very granular monitoring and very easy

very easy extension secure application

1131
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,520
development some things to talk about

1132
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,020
here when you're when you're developing

1133
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,210
an application some things to consider

1134
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,650
of course buffer overflows in a

1135
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,170
cross-site scripting attacks for web

1136
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:35,089
projects things like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you're</font>

1137
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,579
moving along these end up being the best

1138
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:39,650
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> area to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect yourself just</font>

1139
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:41,270
one quick point again if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1140
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,190
mounted encrypted file system the

1141
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:45,020
encryption may not necessarily help you

1142
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,430
because your entire disk is now

1143
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,130
available through an interface so the

1144
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,770
loopback device exists so if you can

1145
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,760
violate the system then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have access</font>

1146
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,170
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that encrypted data and the</font>

1147
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,089
encryption is done you no good so once

1148
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,880
again secure application development is

1149
00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:00,140
very important application firewalls I I

1150
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,540
provides a couple that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,490
necessarily they're not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,460
best for I is one of them is pretty

1153
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:09,439
interesting scheduled probes using

1154
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,329
things like NASA's scheduled operational

1155
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,650
readiness test for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your people and again</font>

1156
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:15,849
having a strict government that

1157
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:18,230
describes how your environment works

1158
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:20,060
some resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can turn to for</font>

1159
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:24,200
further education just a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lists</font>

1160
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:26,000
here lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of links I'll just</font>

1161
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,910
mention a couple of them that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1162
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,500
are particularly worth mentioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1163
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">most which is the fourth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the bottom</font>

1164
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,370
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very interesting</font>

1165
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,230
there's a tool there that allows for

1166
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,700
file carving now these most of these

1167
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,460
tools that are listed<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the next three</font>

1168
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,740
pages are free tools and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1169
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,050
worth looking into again my goal here is

1170
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,089
to provide a framework and then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1171
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,670
throw out a tremendous<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of terms</font>

1172
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:51,260
in this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation so that</font>

1173
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,220
people can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look it up and learn</font>

1174
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,540
more since an hour really isn't enough

1175
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,009
the penguin sleuth kit is another really

1176
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,740
interesting package it's an optics

1177
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:03,170
extension for forensic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis so it's</font>

1178
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,120
been hardened in many ways similar to

1179
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,070
the to the anonymous OS so to speak

1180
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,930
although not to that project is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1181
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,790
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and has a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of really neat</font>

1182
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,279
stuff but the penguin<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleuth kit is</font>

00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,450
specific for not touching not touching

look at these are the people in the

1199
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:53,029
industry if you want to learn more a

1200
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,680
great place to start is with their

1201
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,050
websites or to look for their names on

1202

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brian carrier wrote the</font>

1204
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,060
a lot of interesting text on

investigation not necessarily tools dan

1206
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,140
farmer or incur who<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned earlier</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into criminal procedure in</font>

1210
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,980
forensic investigations this is a person

1211
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,439
to really turn to and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> bruce</font>

1214
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:25,340
coroner's toolkit and also wrote postfix

1215
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,870
a couple of the books<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1216
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,810
really important<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get their hands</font>

1217
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:31,520
on towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom I just threw an</font>

00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:34,070
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux kernel to remind</font>

1219
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,210
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that knowing how your system</font>

1220
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:38,630
works at a very low level is very

1221
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">important this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good book just</font>

1222
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,480
for entertainment I<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend this to</font>

1223
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,940
everyone to have a sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of humor and</font>

1224
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,680
end on top of it this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all very</font>

1225
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,670
relevant because Dirk Gently was a

1226
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,520
forensic investigator

1227
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:53,240
so I'm justified so the long dark

1228
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,590
teatime of this all good book<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

1229
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,140
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn to commercial</font>

1230
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:58,310
organizations at a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1231
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,569
investigation you're not going to be

1232
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,430
able to go any farther with the tools

1233
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,840
that you have and so you'll want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn</font>

1234
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:06,290
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a commercial organization to support</font>

1237
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're a little bit difficult to work</font>

1238
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,570
with from my experience navigant

1239
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:16,190
consulting is good the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> CRO used</font>

1240
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,810
to have a strong forensic investigation

1241
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:20,900
team but they've been losing people to

1242
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:22,340
the upper<font color="#E5E5E5"> three drivesavers is a company</font>

1243
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,470
to turn to if you have a hard drive

1244
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,270
password that's that you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1245
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,980
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get past their an interesting</font>

1246
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,230
place to go to if you heard bad noises

1247
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,180
coming from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard drive and you need</font>

1248
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,340
literally a clean room to work on the on

1249
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,839
the drive they have a storeroom with

1250
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,330
every drive controller you can imagine

1251
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then some other some other</font>

1252
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,830
commercial sites to take a look at and I

1253
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,480
threw a I on here because they've got a

1254
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:46,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of interesting concepts but when it</font>

1255
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,680
comes to security scanners there was a

1256
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,780
recent article that was put out on that

1257
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,850
NIST did<font color="#E5E5E5"> studying what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font>

1258
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,170
scanning tools were and they came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1259
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,390
conclusion that Nessus was the number

1260
00:45:54,170 --> 00:46:00,470
one scanner and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is s was the number</font>

1261
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:02,600
two scanner eik min<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their retina</font>

1262
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:04,370
product came in fairly low behind but

1263
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,900
it's got some really interesting stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1264
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,460
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1265
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,630
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more detailed in their</font>

1266
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:13,670
implementation but other than that

1267
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:16,070
they've got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> good stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

1268
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:18,050
think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh that wraps it up for me so</font>

1269
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:20,660
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to post this on the layer one</font>

1270
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:22,010
website so it's good for its good for

1271
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,690
procedure and it's good for some other

1272
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,100
notes and to go further and if you'd

00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,200
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email me with questions you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this backyard</font>

1283
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:11,900
yes um in forensics investigation

1284
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:11,900
installing software on the box oh and uh

1285
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,720
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily affect it because</font>

1286
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,330
the end evidence is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the</font>

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,189
files however the more the bigger

1288
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:26,040
concern you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is overriding the files</font>

1289
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:27,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there so those tools are really</font>

00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:32,490
beginning as a starting point but again

1292
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,810
in some systems sometimes pulling the

1293
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,819
plug is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only option that</font>

1294
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,020
you've got so you do whatever analysis

1295
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,610
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the tools that are online</font>

1296
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you do the call turkey shut</font>

1297
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:43,350
down and do the drive analysis later

1298
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:45,540
where you have better tools affecting

1299
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:47,279
the data set is not necessarily so bad

1300
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,870
from a court of law point of view the

1301
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,190
most important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing though is not to</font>

1302
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:52,560
destroy potential data that's been

1303
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:55,110
that's been obvious skated or deleted or

1304
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,910
anything of that sort does that does

1305
00:47:55,110 --> 00:48:02,280
that answer the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay any other</font>

1306
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:04,790
questions yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there a place to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1307
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,790
where they actually

1308
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,540
case

1309
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:18,540
oh you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for personal development</font>

1310
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:21,740
sure there's lots of places if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to</font>

1311
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:24,300
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the best ones are available from</font>

1312
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:27,180
carriers site you see if I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1313
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:29,670
listed here it's called digital evidence

1314
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,560
I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so the one two three four</font>

1315
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">five six seven that has some interesting</font>

1316
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,590
links to some data but also as as has

1317
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,600
been mentioned earlier it's also good to

1318
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:41,220
potentially just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on ebay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and get a</font>

1319
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,049
hard drive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then do an analysis on</font>

1320
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,540
that that can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good there's also</font>

1321
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,620
I believe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't looked at the at</font>

1322
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,540
the dist sets of it because

1323
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,520
unfortunately i didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lay out</font>

1324
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,840
50 or 60 bucks for the book but there's

1325
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,520
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that come with some of the</font>

1326
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,190
books out there that have examples in

1327
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,040
them I think me move back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the book</font>

1328
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:04,950
section here I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's uh the real</font>

1329
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:06,630
digital forensics book the one there you

1330
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:08,100
go second one there rail digital

1331
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,710
forensics I believe comes with a CD with

1332
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,120
some example with some examples and also

1333
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system book which is written by</font>

1334
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,589
carrier also has some examples on it to

1335
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:24,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at some interesting images does</font>

1336
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:24,380
that very good any other questions yes

1337
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,580
have you ever dealt with scenario where

1338
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,299
somebody was using a pretty secure

1339
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,299
lysine

1340
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:37,710
I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't colleagues of mine</font>

1341
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,780
have usually that's when you turn to the

1342
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:42,080
programs like mem<font color="#E5E5E5"> dump to get contiguous</font>

1343
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,580
memory dumps of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the system</font>

1344
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,990
again once that machine has been powered

1345
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,120
off there's nothing you can do so again

1346
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:52,339
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from cold turkey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shutdown</font>

1347
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,339
but that's generally the approach oh

1348
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,960
yeah well it doesn't need console access

1349
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:59,250
but it needs a login obviously but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1350
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,770
doesn't need console access to run the

1351
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,540
mem dump I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the older versions</font>

1352
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:06,450
required that you login as root<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1353
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think some of the newer versions will</font>

1354
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:10,589
unless you're running unless your kernel

1355
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,850
is got for example in Linux if you're

1356
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,550
running a kernel that has something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1357
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:16,410
gr security then they usually your<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAT</font>

1358
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,780
gr security segregates processes from

1359
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:20,730
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to see each other's memory</font>

1360
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:26,840
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer take very good any</font>

1361
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:26,840
other questions I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wraps it up</font>
