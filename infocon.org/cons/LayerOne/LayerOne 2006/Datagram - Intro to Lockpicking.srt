3
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:54,899
all right okay so this is an

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduction to lock picking and keep</font>

5
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:05,250
upping yours truly is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Datagram and uh</font>

6
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:07,830
everybody ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh such enthusiasm would</font>

7
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,440
all right so about me I'm a

8
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,630
mild-mannered sysadmin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I program in a</font>

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of languages but those are all the</font>

10
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,500
ones that deemed worthy of putting on

11
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:24,298
the slide I enjoy long walks on the

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:26,790
beach I'm a a computer security

13
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,280
enthusiast because we're politically

14
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,440
correct here and I'm also into

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock-picking but i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bona fide</font>

16
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,459
locksmith because i am poor so I can't

17
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:43,650
take the nine hundred dollar six-month

18
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:45,959
course yet so moving right on so Wow yes

19
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,799
I do and I'm also<font color="#E5E5E5"> raising for a key</font>

20
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,630
machine fund so so first off we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

21
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,239
to do lock picking a key<font color="#E5E5E5"> buffing will be</font>

22
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,470
the second half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the talk and to know</font>

23
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,049
how to pick the lock of course you need

24
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know how to lock works internally how</font>

25
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:02,760
keys work to normally open a lock and

26
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,959
then we'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into picking and even all</font>

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:10,200
sorts of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of locks so how</font>

28
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,420
locks work and so that'll be the front

29
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,179
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lock and I actually have this</font>

30
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,850
lock here with me where's the X can't

31
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,850
see it very well on that but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

32
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,130
it looks to you from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside and</font>

33
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,739
most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this but they don't</font>

34
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,890
know how locks work internally and on

35
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,630
the left you have how it looks to us and

36
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,100
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is how it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks internally</font>

37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,480
and inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there's two pins and</font>

38
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,940
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just two</font>

39
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:46,160
pins they're arranged in a fashion such

40
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,160
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

41
00:03:46,890 --> 00:04:03,190
such as this so there's several of them

42
00:03:50,940 --> 00:04:07,390
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that yeah so there's several</font>

43
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:12,040
holes and their stacks of pins with this

44
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:15,130
spring on top pushing them down you know

45
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,019
so the lock works that when you don't

46
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a crack key inserted or other</font>

47
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:23,980
bypass methods you'll turn it and the

48
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:26,109
top pin will force the cylinder to not

49
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,900
be able to rotate because it's walking

50
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:33,040
the path and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's another</font>

51
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-resolution photo care care of</font>

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,740
strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> carlson of a cutaway lock so you</font>

53
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,419
could see the springs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top pins</font>

54
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,110
don't mind them the marker that's for my

55
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:46,710
own purposes and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put a pic all</font>

56
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,290
the way through it so you could see how

57
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">both pins but we were not expedient</font>

58
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:58,960
enough to get the I resolution photo

59
00:04:51,820 --> 00:05:01,780
that one yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's how keys</font>

60
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,700
work on the left you see the the lock

61
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,219
with without anything inserted and

62
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,080
that's how it's it's normally all the

63
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,790
pins are set so all of those blue pins

64
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,830
would be blocking the cylinder from

65
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,660
turning on the right you have the key

66
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,020
and what the key acts to do is raise all

67
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,000
those to this line right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is known</font>

68
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,919
as the shear line and when all those pin

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,220
pairs are there the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug can freely</font>

70
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,960
rotate so that uh and then it'll engage

71
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,270
whatever locking mechanism to open the

72
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">locker lock the lock is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

73
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:34,479
on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

74
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">how the key works it'll raise the pimp</font>

75
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,219
air again not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one but all of</font>

76
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:42,310
them to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ripe is right height and</font>

77
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,950
then rotate it note that there's a small

78
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,710
gap between the two pins that's so that

79
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,180
it can freely rotate without having to

80
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:53,620
have extremely extremely extremely

81
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,000
precise keys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a small bit of</font>

82
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,940
leeway and this comes in handy when

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're picking so picking a lock</font>

84
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,920
normally with a key you're applying

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,960
torque when you turn the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key and at that</font>

86
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,560
point all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pins are raised to the</font>

87
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,469
right position picking it's not as easy

88
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:15,600
first you have to use a small tool

89
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,600
called a torque wrench to apply torque

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,280
and one of these pics and you what you

91
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,500
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is you want to apply torque</font>

92
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,789
and find what's known as the binding pin

93
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,100
and we'll get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a second and</font>

94
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll raise all the pin pairs to the</font>

95
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,290
shear line and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug will rotate</font>

96
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,390
so setting a pin this is what it looks

97
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,260
like when you're picking it note that

98
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:43,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> torque supplied first so that a</font>

99
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:47,650
frictions caused between the rotation of

100
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:49,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">the plug and the blue pin so that when</font>

101
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,640
you raise it to the correct level the

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,350
cylinder<font color="#CCCCCC"> will rotate and capture the top</font>

103
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,000
pin above it instead of just<font color="#E5E5E5"> letting it</font>

104
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:01,120
fall back down is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone clear I</font>

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,590
wanna feel free to ask questions at any

106
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,530
time just shout shit out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine</font>

107
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:10,530
what's up so like in the position where

108
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,530
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Louisiana my cousin to like</font>

109
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:22,000
well the spring is pushing the top pin

110
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:23,890
down well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this situation you'd be</font>

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,480
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up with the pick another like</font>

112
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,710
what keeps the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rattlers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no over there</font>

113
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,990
yeah what keeps the red pin on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

114
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:32,340
bottom no<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll fall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back down once you</font>

115
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:35,980
set the pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that that's actually</font>

116
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,060
yeah if once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this then that pin</font>

117
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:43,600
will fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> back down to its original</font>

118
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:46,030
position<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well the way the cylinder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

119
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,890
designed it it hooks it in it doesn't

120
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,539
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all straight through hole yeah</font>

121
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,650
it has like a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> dip at the end so</font>

122
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:57,640
it holds it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so like I said pin</font>

123
00:07:53,650 --> 00:08:01,120
binding you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the cylinders</font>

124
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,159
in in or the chambers in the plug would

125
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,130
be drilled straight so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you</font>

126
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,800
wrote when you put torque on it it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

127
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:12,760
hit all of those at once the rotation of

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,040
this the rotation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this would hit all</font>

129
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,599
those pins at once the pin pairs but

130
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,090
that's not true because we are not that

131
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,420
perfect and what ends up happening is

132
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,710
that they're all slightly off by

133
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,020
measures of distance<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I can't even</font>

134
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,210
begin to describe because i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

135
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,310
the intelligence to so what happens is

136
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,799
that when they're all slightly off one

137
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:36,100
pair of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pins will hit the road the</font>

138
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,689
rotating plate before anything else and

139
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:42,220
that will cause what's known as binding

140
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:45,670
and that's friction between it and so in

141
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,830
this example here assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

142
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,439
rotating counterclockwise it hit this

143
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,990
top pin first because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be the</font>

144
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,150
most to the left and that would cause

145
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,830
friction and you'd know that that pin is

146
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,890
binding because of that added friction

147
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,420
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing the pin pairs up</font>

148
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,740
normally they'd be very loose if you're

149
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,260
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> applying any torque at all but when</font>

150
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,090
you do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pin binds it has added</font>

151
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,670
added pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it when you're pushing</font>

152
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:13,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">it up and that will be demonstrated more</font>

153
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,949
in the examples later and so the point

154
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:18,490
of this is that there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to set</font>

155
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,650
a lock unless you specifically drill the

156
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chamber's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how you want in this example</font>

157
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,920
if they are drilled from left to right

158
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,360
then you pick

159
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,729
assuming you're turning clockwise you'd

160
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,680
pick the lock from<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to front and</font>

161
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,839
vice versa for the opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation</font>

162
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,689
does that make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

163
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,880
picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lock you like I said the three</font>

164
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,680
steps insert<font color="#E5E5E5"> your torque wrench put very</font>

165
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,139
minimal torque the beginner mistake is

166
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,239
to put excessive torque you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

167
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,850
could use feather touches for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

168
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">of locks and we'll get into that later</font>

169
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,490
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example you note that wait</font>

170
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,440
for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reset oh you'll note that the</font>

171
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,860
binding pin will visually have more

172
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,790
force applied to it as as the locksmith

173
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:06,550
or deviant as will say these pins all

174
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,959
have no torque or no binding on it but

175
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one did and notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how it was</font>

176
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:15,819
harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push up that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

177
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:21,130
we'll do a demonstration so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

178
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:29,560
you have these or have seen these this

179
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:31,680
is a standard master lock demonstration

180
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,680
effect

181
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:54,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh seriously though and it also works</font>

182
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:56,410
for gun locks I'll need a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> pic</font>

183
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:59,139
you should should be noted<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gun</font>

184
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:03,629
locks are made for child safety not for

185
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,629
protection of your guns for good<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

186
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:16,359
uh yeah and what's scarier is that

187
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:20,649
bumping is actually even easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

188
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:27,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">even open already no well I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

189
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:30,790
too much time doing that yeah I have a

190
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,969
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of locks on the table but wow</font>

191
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,069
I have another master lock i could pick

192
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,079
I like master locks because they don't

193
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:49,449
produce a demonstration effect all too

194
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:50,800
often most up and on their own and it

195
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,269
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> noted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all the different</font>

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,998
master locks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this table I could pick</font>

197
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:57,850
even this bad boy but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one just</font>

198
00:11:54,999 --> 00:12:00,179
takes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a minute longer I just</font>

199
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:04,449
can't afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to waste that much time so</font>

200
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,980
moving right along so high security

201
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:08,258
locks these have all been very simple

202
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,420
you'd think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> extremely easy to pick</font>

203
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:13,779
all the locks in your building n it

204
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,449
might be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

205
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:19,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">security locks offer a one or more of</font>

206
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:22,719
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or more of these security</font>

207
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:25,360
features they'll have a very restrictive

208
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,709
key way so that only specialized keys

209
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,959
can go in and it'll make it a lot harder

210
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:31,300
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to insert my pic in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

211
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,559
all that stuff added with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that</font>

212
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,899
I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to insert the torque wrench</font>

213
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,019
somewhere you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a whole lot of</font>

214
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">room to move in some key ways and</font>

215
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:42,160
security pins in our examples all the

216
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,329
top pins and the bottom pins have been

217
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">normal-looking they've just been</font>

218
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:49,680
rectangular but of course cylindrical

219
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,780
but they have specialized designs on

220
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,089
them that will help so that when when

221
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,530
something when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I set a pin and something</font>

222
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,090
else behind so that'll get stuck and

223
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,560
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different ways that</font>

224
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">they could do that there's also</font>

225
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,339
something called a side pin which is um

226
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,740
well why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through these</font>

227
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could see as I explained them so</font>

228
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,480
restrictive key ways there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

229
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's our food that's our friend</font>

230
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,080
from whichever Star Wars movie I don't

231
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,200
know I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a star wars guy but that's</font>

232
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:21,450
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it reminded me of and he's actually</font>

233
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:25,260
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today so as you can see</font>

234
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:29,490
very scary very hard to pick very hard

235
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,720
to yeah very hard to pick the best locks

236
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,160
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a lot more</font>

237
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,910
security features than just that but

238
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,980
that's that's very prominent to me so

239
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving on like I said different types of</font>

240
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,160
top pins will be used to touch the pin

241
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,930
and on the left you can see how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

242
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">be normally and on the right would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

243
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,709
when it's picked remember if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

244
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,410
the key everything's raised before it's

245
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,910
rotated so this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem so what</font>

246
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,130
happens here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody applies torque</font>

247
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,689
but they apply too much torque so it'll

248
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,880
move that over and when he tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push</font>

249
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,010
that pin up it'll hit the right side of

250
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lock and not be able to go up and</font>

251
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,930
free itself from the shear line and they

252
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,079
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of other designs his</font>

253
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:14,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">school pin works in the same way here's</font>

254
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:19,290
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal favorite serrated pins and</font>

255
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:21,480
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember in our in our very first</font>

256
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,560
lock this one has<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom serrated pins</font>

257
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,790
and you could see him pretty clearly

258
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:30,239
right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope is that a visible all</font>

259
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,430
right good so yeah and they all work in

260
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,960
essentially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way and people ask</font>

261
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,060
me is it still possible to pick locks

262
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,190
with security pins yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to</font>

263
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,680
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finesse like you can't</font>

264
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,650
just jam things in there you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

265
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,939
more careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have a lock box that</font>

266
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,150
i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting up after the talk</font>

267
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,070
that'll have a the hardest luck<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put up</font>

268
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,600
there has all security pins for top pins

269
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:56,580
so if you pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> come talk to me</font>

270
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also made one that has three pins</font>

271
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">and one security pin so that you could</font>

272
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,270
feel when that pin catches and you know

273
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:08,670
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of adjust yourself to be able to</font>

274
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:09,900
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easily so and then side pins so</font>

275
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,689
here's our cylinder and that little

276
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,819
metallic silver thing right here is

277
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,290
sticking out so normally the plug would

278
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,870
not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn because that would</font>

279
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,480
be hitting something inside the lock and

280
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way that this is works with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

281
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">real key is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the key looks like that</font>

282
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:29,100
it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> that small thing right here and</font>

283
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,990
that pin would fall into it when the

284
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,680
correct key is inserted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

285
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:38,460
to rotate assuming it's this is the

286
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,439
sledge Everest actually but there's a

287
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,080
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this specific thing is</font>

288
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:47,730
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured oh hey why don't we just</font>

289
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this and cut that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and not only</font>

290
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:53,100
that but this doubles as a torque wrench

291
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,010
yeah a tension wrench so then all they

292
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,840
have to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then go and go</font>

293
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,540
through and pick all the normal pin

294
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,060
pairs but then there's an improvement on

295
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,660
this called sidebars and what that is is

296
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">its same kind of idea as a side pin but</font>

297
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,199
there's several of them and you can see

298
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,050
in the key it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> to two ridges that have</font>

299
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,700
cuts so the the bottom rage would

300
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,020
activate the sidebar and it's a

301
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,700
mechanism right here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't</font>

302
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,189
really find a horribly good picture of

303
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,080
but when all these are raised this this

304
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,510
piece right here would slide into that

305
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,190
slot and that ball would move itself and

306
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,350
the plug would be free to rotate if all

307
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,580
the rest of the pins were set right that

308
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sense and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have care of</font>

309
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:40,310
care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero we have a I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

310
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,310
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sh</font>

311
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,600
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> schlage Primus and this</font>

312
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:50,590
actually has another security feature

313
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:53,260
that I believe is next one problem with

314
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:56,080
this is this specific ah so v10 is that

315
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,720
in a given region all the auto v tens

316
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,970
will have the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> sidebar cut so what</font>

317
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,030
that means later on for bumping is that

318
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,310
you could purchase a key locally and

319
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,069
that would work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it have the same side</font>

320
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:14,829
bar as all the AUSA locks locally that's

321
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:17,409
obviously a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem yeah because yeah</font>

322
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,389
the sidebar would should be different so

323
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,250
that you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get a specific</font>

324
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,530
sidebar for that key<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a specific and</font>

325
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,030
then make the bump key for that lock but

326
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,030
it should be different from LA to LA I

327
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,920
don't personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but I think so</font>

328
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:43,110
yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far a given region</font>

329
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:46,600
is but that's how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes I know they</font>

330
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,830
they can't get their own key way because

331
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,169
then they'd to be making their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own logs</font>

332
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:54,460
um I mean maybe that everyone should

333
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,040
have a different one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

334
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,770
specifically with that because that

335
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense but I guess not and also</font>

336
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,990
note the security pin usage and this

337
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,360
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing catches here as well so</font>

338
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,070
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very hard lock to pick but not</font>

339
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,510
that hard to bump and we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

340
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:15,310
that later I know down and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

341
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,500
the coolest security feature is axial

342
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,360
rotation and normally in all our

343
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,860
examples the pins just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be raised</font>

344
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,139
to the right place and then rotate and

345
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,479
then the key will rotate freely these

346
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,160
pins need to be rotated in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right way</font>

347
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,710
as well so you're raising them and

348
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,720
rotating them and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example you</font>

349
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,090
can see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuts kind of strangely</font>

350
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,470
so that they'll fit on the lock in the

351
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,370
way that they're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to or fit onto</font>

352
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,080
the key and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that they're</font>

353
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:41,530
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be rotated there's a better</font>

354
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,270
picture here so when these there's a

355
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,639
little dimple right here I don't know if

356
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,440
you can see that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> when all those are</font>

357
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,960
rotated correctly there the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sidebar will</font>

358
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,510
slide into that and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotate so</font>

359
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,389
it's a more<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced sidebar and it's</font>

360
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">very nice medico I believe originally</font>

361
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:59,799
with this don't hold me to that but like

362
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:03,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said this this lage Primus also has</font>

363
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:07,479
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of technology I think like</font>

364
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:11,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said not bona fide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes sir and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

365
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:13,089
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of a medical key and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

366
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,950
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they're all kind of angles and</font>

367
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:16,678
so that works that when you insert that

368
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,440
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll rotate those all correctly</font>

369
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:23,320
very complex requires the key machine to

370
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,109
cut that but they are pickable some

371
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,359
people have figured out ways to kind of

372
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:31,089
modify your normal pic set so that you

373
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:34,329
can kind of get a grip on the pins and

374
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:37,749
rotate<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they are applicable but</font>

375
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:39,879
extremely hard to do and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

376
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:42,429
probably one of the best american-made

377
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:48,369
locks that you can get they come on pay

378
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:49,690
phones newspaper machines so yeah so so

379
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:51,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">far what we've talked about have been</font>

380
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,129
pin tumbler locks but there's of course

381
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,679
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of locks we have warded</font>

382
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:58,839
locks and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> right into that so warded</font>

383
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:03,479
locks outside they look the same but

384
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:05,349
inside it look differently and they use

385
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:09,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I guess they didn't bring any of</font>

386
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:11,769
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I brought the key though they use</font>

387
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:13,539
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> latching spring instead of pin stacks</font>

388
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:15,820
and there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one important latch</font>

389
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:18,249
unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pins LOL you have to raise</font>

390
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,739
all the pin pairs you only have to move

391
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:22,299
one latch in this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it and all the</font>

392
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:24,279
other latches in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just get in</font>

393
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:26,589
the way so that if you put the wrong key

394
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:29,379
in it'll not be able to turn correctly

395
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:31,359
and they do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> warded pics and you can</font>

396
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:34,149
buy them<font color="#E5E5E5"> or make them and they're</font>

397
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,009
they're very popular locks you just like

398
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:38,320
visually this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> look the same as the</font>

399
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:40,419
master lock<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just picked but the</font>

400
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,718
innards are much different and that's a

401
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:46,119
visual of how it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside so when</font>

402
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:48,309
that red pieces is knocked out of the

403
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:52,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">way the bar will jump up it's very</font>

404
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:54,908
simple but at present it might be better

405
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,159
than pin tumbler technology and we'll

406
00:20:54,909 --> 00:21:00,309
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that later so and then there's</font>

407
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:04,329
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of warded pics and actually</font>

408
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm sorry did I these are hints on where</font>

409
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:09,100
pics

410
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,620
and you could purchase these for twenty

411
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:21,580
bucks while supplies last year talk to

412
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:25,899
em<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and then of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two-wheeler</font>

413
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,178
locks I'm sure you've all seen these on

414
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:32,169
bike locks very big on vending machines

415
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:33,640
that sort of thing and there there's pin

416
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:35,470
tumblers essentially they're just

417
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,830
arranged in a circle so they need a

418
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:41,230
specialized key and they have tubular

419
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,240
pics ballpoint pen casing works on

420
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,610
really crappy tube with our locks if you

421
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,130
have a bicycle lock take the the ink

422
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,379
portion out of your your bic pen put it

423
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,049
in and get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that it grips on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

424
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,919
piece right here try and rotate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and a</font>

425
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:58,240
surprising number of bike locks suck but

426
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,190
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess if you're if you're riding</font>

427
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bike then you can't afford really high</font>

428
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,990
security any of myself and here's an

429
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,980
example of tubular pics and these are

430
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:13,510
manufactured expensive but but quite

431
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:18,220
ingenious and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have one right</font>

432
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:22,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">here and you can see that they're little</font>

433
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:25,690
nibs and the idea is that you take all

434
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:27,280
of these and push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down like that so</font>

435
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,990
that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all straight and you</font>

436
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,240
tighten this and I actually don't own a

437
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,559
tubular lock unfortunately I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

438
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">one off a vending machine but that was</font>

439
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">really heavy and we couldn't get it</font>

440
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:39,370
through the door so so what you do is

441
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,039
you you insert this all the way into the

442
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,840
lock and slowly rotate it and the

443
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:46,539
pressure of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pins pushing back will</font>

444
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,299
push these little lot these little

445
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,830
sliders up into the right position<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

446
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:53,260
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you open it will you have</font>

447
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,928
picked it you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a copy of how the</font>

448
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,850
pins are supposed to be set so if you

449
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,299
have a tubular key machine you can make

450
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,299
a key for that

451
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:08,660
dimple locks AKA computer locks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

452
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,189
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> why people are so inclined to</font>

453
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:15,799
call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they have nothing to do</font>

454
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:18,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">with computers but they're they're uber</font>

455
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,900
leet keys they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look cooler they're</font>

456
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,070
the same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pin tumbler technology</font>

457
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,040
they're just arranged horizontally

458
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,590
instead of vertically the key way that

459
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,600
is and they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to pick with</font>

460
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,280
these pics i have here and they're

461
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,459
commonly found like this case though is

462
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,740
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very secure lock in my</font>

463
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,950
opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> i might be wrong though a lot of</font>

464
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,230
automobiles and the the bar deals that

465
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,910
you fit on your steering wheel<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah my</font>

466
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,720
dad had this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case he brought back from</font>

467
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:49,280
work he didn't have he had two key for

468
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,900
it the key looked like that it had less

469
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">simples only had one language but it</font>

470
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:59,130
also had teeth for a thing

471
00:23:53,060 --> 00:24:01,290
um I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's right oh that</font>

472
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,790
they do make a lot of crazy keys but I

473
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:10,620
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen anything like that</font>

474
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:13,320
personally it might exist yeah yeah well

475
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,939
well what happens is on that that's not

476
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,689
not always the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they have</font>

477
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,620
regular pin tumbler keys for like your

478
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,180
master locks that I'll have a like a

479
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,520
dimple in the side and what that works

480
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,620
to do is a ball bearing will slide into

481
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,750
that and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in the right spot the</font>

482
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,090
the key will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn so maybe</font>

483
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what you saw but I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

484
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:39,600
yeah I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

485
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:43,140
personally so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how den Polacks</font>

486
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,969
look and like this you could it's easy

487
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,310
to visualize how little room there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

488
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:53,670
pick things but they do have dimple pics

489
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:55,679
extremely small as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see but you</font>

490
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">could buy them online and I'm told</font>

491
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,330
they're they're fairly effective but I

492
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:05,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't had the pleasure of being able</font>

493
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:07,620
to try one yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> so another fun begins</font>

494
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:11,790
lock bumping how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know what</font>

495
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:15,600
bumping is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so all the people that</font>

496
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:18,420
know me again all right I want everybody

497
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:23,510
to pull out their keys right now pull

498
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:26,820
them out seriously come on I could art

499
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:29,580
all right now look look on your keys and

500
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,100
on the the head of the key there should

501
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:37,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">be an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> indentation not a number but it</font>

502
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:42,449
should say KW 1 SC 1 if you have either

503
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,950
of those keys raise your hand so so

504
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,390
everybody that could find our keys this

505
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,010
morning before leaving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel all</font>

506
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:52,140
right okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind keep</font>

507
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,210
that in mind so lock bumping we're going

508
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,450
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into hell bumping works pick guns</font>

509
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:59,790
making bunkies an advancement called

510
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,160
minimal movement<font color="#E5E5E5"> method and how to</font>

511
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:04,710
defend against bumping which very few

512
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,119
locks are actually working on doing at

513
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">least in the USA</font>

514
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,908
Europe's a bit more informed about this

515
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:14,279
so the general<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to bumping there</font>

516
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:18,299
been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of interviews in most</font>

517
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:20,459
countries they have a local police or

518
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,559
federal police whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> will put out a</font>

519
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:24,029
list of like these are secure locks

520
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,519
these are what you should buy because

521
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:28,529
they passed our approval ratings and you

522
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,699
know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a five-star lock so no</font>

523
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:33,359
one's going to be able to get in in here

524
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:37,169
you're perfectly safe again much like

525
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cyber world that never works and the</font>

526
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:40,909
general response has been that that's

527
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:43,529
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not real you're using rig blocks</font>

528
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:45,539
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard only professionals can do</font>

529
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:49,019
it and you'll see i'm pretty much an

530
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,209
idiot so as we as we move along you

531
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,179
won't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it too much</font>

532
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:56,069
you need a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money a lot of time</font>

533
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:59,939
yesterday i was making lock box with em

534
00:26:56,069 --> 00:27:01,529
and between like three and six and was

535
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:03,269
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there filing as many keys as he</font>

536
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:07,069
want and he got all the locks that we

537
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:09,179
bought open in a couple hours and

538
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:12,269
there's only about five minutes of

539
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,009
filing and then three<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a that</font>

540
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:17,429
holes too small oh that holds too big

541
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:20,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in but uh that sort of</font>

542
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:21,299
stuff and you need you know every kind

543
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:24,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">of key on the market for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one hundred</font>

544
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:26,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent efficiency keys must be made you</font>

545
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:28,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">know one hundredth of a million meter</font>

546
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,449
exact you know no one could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that</font>

547
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:33,329
precise because no one owns key machine

548
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:35,939
right and keep keys are very hard to

549
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:38,879
obtain this true for some but generally

550
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:40,379
not the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you just go buy a lock</font>

551
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:42,899
that has that key and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can</font>

552
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:45,829
modify it into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bump key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and burglars</font>

553
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:50,069
need to know what lock it is before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

554
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:52,859
can look at it I could look at my key

555
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:54,359
that I have say say I know all my

556
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:56,869
building has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key but I don't have the</font>

557
00:27:54,359 --> 00:28:00,149
master key I'll know exactly what it is

558
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:02,129
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys now that I've been kind of</font>

559
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:04,049
doing this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while I can just look</font>

560
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:08,309
at and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the the key way I'll be able</font>

561
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:11,999
to tell it's it's not as hard as it

562
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:14,039
looks it's a general idea or<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a lot</font>

563
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,240
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the the name on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lock</font>

564
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,480
and

565
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,640
very few key ways so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't you</font>

566
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,020
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe four or five at most for any</font>

567
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:28,080
particular brand<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what exactly is</font>

568
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,090
bumping bumping is taking a key that

569
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,189
fits the lock<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's that's the key</font>

570
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,790
so remember all of you have those two

571
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:38,160
locks those two key ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should say</font>

572
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:40,740
and you modify the key in such a way

573
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:44,400
that it will work in the newton's cradle

574
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:47,070
cradle principle but with the pins and

575
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,400
this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how pic guns which have</font>

576
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:52,320
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time work and we</font>

577
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,150
have a demo of is everybody knew a

578
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,220
Newton's Cradle is there's a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

579
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,840
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there so when you pull one ball</font>

580
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,429
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let it go only one ball from the</font>

581
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,428
other side will move because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy</font>

582
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:05,010
is transferred between the middle wall

583
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:06,390
yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know go see your physics</font>

584
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,629
teacher and he'll he'll just stare<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

585
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,660
that for hours I swear so here's an

586
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,970
example note that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three does not</font>

587
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,370
move and you might think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this isn't</font>

588
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,410
fully planned out but I assure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

589
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,120
you remember the colors<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our pins that</font>

590
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,990
relate directly to the colors of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

591
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:29,699
pool balls I know I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> color coordinated</font>

592
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:32,100
and shit so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

593
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,870
and this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> pic guns work which have</font>

594
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,399
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while they'll hit all</font>

595
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,840
of those and the force will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

596
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,250
transferred up to the blue pin and

597
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,290
they'll jump and when they're above that

598
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,500
line of course the keel turn if you're

599
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting to work on it makes sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

600
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I'm sure some of your drawing</font>

601
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:52,650
conclusion is how this works with keys

602
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:55,260
same idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and these are examples I</font>

603
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:57,360
note that dimple locks this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

604
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,940
any pin tumbler lock that isn't designed

605
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,540
to prevent it which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very few at the</font>

606
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,420
moment note that dimple locks aren't any

607
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:09,600
different they do require a dimple thing

608
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,340
to cut them of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course that's a little</font>

609
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,050
bit harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come by but still that</font>

610
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,790
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point if somebody really</font>

611
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,980
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in they'll get in if you</font>

612
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not using a good luck there's also</font>

613
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,400
the the awesome v10 right here our

614
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,850
friend with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad side bar and some</font>

615
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,120
other European locks at you

616
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:30,129
probably never heard of so making a bump

617
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,580
key of course take a key that will fit

618
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:36,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock so how many of you said you had</font>

619
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:41,790
the quick set of this lage see I got a

620
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:46,899
quick set I have about eight plays yeah

621
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:49,300
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take them all off so here's my</font>

622
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick set bump key how many of your kw1</font>

623
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:59,139
doors could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I open all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them with a</font>

624
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:10,230
bit of luck mostly not locked up and

625
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:18,750
yeah that's it sorry I actually see that

626
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:18,750
yeah I have a sledge key as well

627
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:27,520
somewhere I have a master but you know

628
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:31,230
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw sometimes you don't even need</font>

629
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,220
a bump key for master locks there it is

630
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:41,380
now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one we made</font>

631
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:44,310
yesterday and with the exception of the

632
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:47,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick set key ologies were filed by hand</font>

633
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,760
so you want to cut a 999 key and in

634
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,659
locksmithing terms that'd be the deepest

635
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:55,180
pin depth some keys go to six the lowest

636
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,730
but the general rule of thumb as far as

637
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,020
i've found is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the pins</font>

638
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,390
aren't going to ever be able to fall

639
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,940
past the first award which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cuts</font>

640
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,440
in the sides of the keys so that's

641
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,530
generally where the bottoms of all these

642
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,210
pins are so all you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a key that</font>

643
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">will fit the lock you cut it down so</font>

644
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,580
that all the pin wear the pins would lay

645
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,080
would be at<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote-unquote 999 and you</font>

646
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,939
could use key gauges for this which

647
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,070
we'll get into in a second and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

648
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,110
see in in the visual of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how how the</font>

649
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,120
locks mark from the keys modified sorry

650
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:28,360
and you could do this with a hand file

651
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,709
dremel or professional key cutter would

652
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:36,600
be the most precise thing to do it with

653
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:40,860
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it important to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teeth</font>

654
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">can I just be bars on my flat um well</font>

655
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:46,799
when you when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a factory-made 999</font>

656
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,110
key they have a campy flat and you'll

657
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,418
see why in a second but they definitely

658
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,370
do need those you shouldn't make them

659
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,870
very prominent<font color="#E5E5E5"> oral silky will get stuck</font>

660
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:59,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the lock which we can attest you</font>

661
00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:01,439
yesterday but they definitely do need it

662
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:05,250
and you'll see why in a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> I promise</font>

663
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,919
and I fit again kick-out<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something I</font>

664
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:11,279
desperately need so like I said key

665
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,559
gauges and these have different sets of

666
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:19,820
keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you all you have to do is take</font>

667
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:23,428
your take your key and see fine kwikset

668
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">clicks that and just put it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a look</font>

669
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:27,960
goes all the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the bottom and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

670
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,120
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used they sell them online very</font>

671
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,990
cheap this one I believe is eight bucks

672
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,760
and it has a quick sets lage master lock

673
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,250
wiser and less lock and I'm sure

674
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,990
everybody in the room has one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

675
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,100
one of those locks either at work or at

676
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:46,529
home in one way or another and Sookie

677
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:51,320
bumping so now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've created the</font>

678
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:51,320
key what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do and see</font>

679
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:04,310
what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is take the key and</font>

680
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:08,900
keep in mind this is e quite an

681
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">old-school method but it does work you</font>

682
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,620
want to take the key and pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out one</font>

683
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,470
pin depth and that might seem kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

684
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,009
hard to fathom but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy you'll</font>

685
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:21,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel it click and the force of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

686
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:25,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">springs will keep it key in place so you</font>

687
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:29,150
do that take it out one and hit it boom

688
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:33,560
and right there you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it that</font>

689
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:35,750
makes sense very simple again but only

690
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,360
professionals and people spent years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

691
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:43,040
their life training in a temple I can do

692
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:45,650
this so and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said hit it with</font>

693
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,469
something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could hit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with anything</font>

694
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:52,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you like but they have developed special</font>

695
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:55,310
tools to do this to do this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in</font>

696
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:58,670
the picture we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the ke bump and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

697
00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:01,759
actually have one today and it's it's

698
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,920
just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the kind of a</font>

699
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,380
bit a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of spring to it and a hard</font>

700
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,330
plastic on the top and a little handle

701
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:12,290
this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I busted does so this is this</font>

702
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:14,720
is a good one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I busted</font>

703
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,610
this is when when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just kind of go</font>

704
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,419
like this without it hitting anything

705
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:22,010

to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of kind of damage so</font>

708

734
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:03,300
that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the correct key for this</font>

735
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,550
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'd be cheating of course we</font>

00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:09,660
do that yeah that's definitely not the

737

756
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:27,620

757
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:29,810
on yourself so shit should<font color="#E5E5E5"> i verify it</font>

762
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,970
put very slight pressure so that when

763
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:50,450
they jump it'll turn exactly just very

764
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:59,299
slight hit again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

765
00:38:50,450 --> 00:39:00,560
turn yeah yeah 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one this one's a</font>

766
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,860
little trickier you have to touch it

767
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,480
right as you hit it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll pull</font>

768
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:10,430
it out one for you guys because I feel

769
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:13,120
we're close like that can go freak out

770
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,120
my neighbors now

771
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:30,190
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple you worried you're gonna</font>

772
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:32,349
get rid of all your quick sets so I'm

773
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,059
hoping everybody believes me because I

774
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:38,700
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and that worked better</font>

775
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:41,200
than when I bumped them Sir I try this

776
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:46,240
I'll keep going but you you could play

777
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:49,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">with all my toys you want sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font>

778
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:54,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so while he's enjoying busting up</font>

779
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:57,579
master locks will move on to bumping

780
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:59,559
tracks one problem deformations can

781
00:39:57,579 --> 00:40:03,160
occur when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the key in the</font>

782
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:05,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">shoulder will very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> likely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ricochet</font>

783
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,359
against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top part of the lock and you</font>

784
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see a picture that here and if you</font>

785
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to me after I could show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

786
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:16,140
of my locks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people here beat the</font>

787
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:18,220
hell out of so like why won't it open

788
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:22,240
some people just don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bum fool</font>

789
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:25,930
apparently and so they have a solution

790
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:29,649
to this the glue gun shoulder and these

791
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:31,868
shoulder on the key is this piece right

792
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,430
here that that's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font>

793
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:36,489
stops it from going into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

794
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:39,940
farther so that all the the cuts are

795
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:41,980
lined up correctly with the pins so what

796
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,470
they do is you take off the shoulder and

797
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,180
put a glue gun shoulder there and this

798
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't hurt the lock because does</font>

799
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:53,890
everybody know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what a glue gun is no oh</font>

800
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:57,910
it's it's a device that has it it

801
00:40:53,890 --> 00:41:00,249
looking it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a gun and you and</font>

802
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,420
they have a they have hard glue sticks

803
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,890
and you push them through the back and

804
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a heating thing in there so that</font>

805
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,009
when you push them through it'll melt

806
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:10,808
them and come out as glue on the other

807
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:13,450
hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ingenious the guy who made</font>

808
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a millionaire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright it's alright</font>

809
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:18,460
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't expect most of you to know</font>

810
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,660
because yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz you're not because</font>

811
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,319
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not old ladies making sweaters</font>

812
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,319
and 19

813
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,799
so it's very simple I'm sure you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

814
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,380
fathom how do you heat the halves

815
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,300
together and stick them on the key and

816
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,000
then bump and that will break after

817
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:42,859
bumping it enough but ballistics are

818
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:47,810
cheap as hell so yeah exactly you get it

819
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">no try picking our you're all familiar</font>

820
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,830
with the picking methods now you could

821
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:58,250
use a check on<font color="#CCCCCC"> you we'll find out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

822
00:41:51,830 --> 00:42:01,029
we so they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> improved on the</font>

823
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:08,570
bumping method the pullout method

824
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:10,880
surprisingly enough not so effective who

825
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:13,190
would have thought so what they did is

826
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,690
they made a minimal movement method and

827
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,770
what they do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how it look if</font>

828
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,000
you pushed it all the way and when you

829
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:20,060
hit this nothing had happened because it

830
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't be able to move oops so you</font>

831
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:26,060
take you the highlighted points you saw

832
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:41,390
them off I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how there's no picture</font>

833
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:47,710
there for no reason now i'm sad that's

834
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:47,710
my bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ruined</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright go home</font>

835
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:56,359
what the hell now they're there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

836
00:42:50,480 --> 00:43:01,369
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lied um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well or don't start</font>

837
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:04,130
the slideshow so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you file</font>

838
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:07,130
off you file off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tip and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

839
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,680
shoulder very small amounts and instead

840
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,510
when you put this into the lock it'll

841
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the springs will kind of push it</font>

842
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,660
out because you could push<font color="#CCCCCC"> it farther in</font>

843
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,670
because now the shoulders<font color="#E5E5E5"> not stopping</font>

844
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let go this the spring</font>

845
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,089
pressure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to push it back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out to</font>

846
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,640
where it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so that all the pins</font>

847
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:24,500
are aligned correctly so the minimal

848
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,879
movement method you don't have to pull

849
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,359
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and I believe this one actually</font>

850
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,359
works

851
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:39,960
I have too many<font color="#CCCCCC"> kwikset bump keys by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

852
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:45,200
way and our good friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zach tested this</font>

853
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,200
thoroughly at the last 2600 here in LA

854
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:57,270
doesn't turn yeah well look<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder it's</font>

855
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,030
going to be kind of hard to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but</font>

856
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:04,980
I could push it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and it'll push itself</font>

857
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:06,420
back out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not visible yeah that's</font>

858
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:11,180
protocol how you know you did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

859
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:11,180
and then just like normal torque here oh

860
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:31,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how many other I don't</font>

861
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,990
know with a master lock big one no

862
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,540
where'd you put that key I'm seriously

863
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:45,660
man come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh running a show there</font>

864
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:51,320
there you go I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this might</font>

865
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:51,319
be the wrong keepest it fits though<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font>

866
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:58,049
shit let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me try this I won't fit oh this</font>

867
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">one will definitely work because this is</font>

868
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:02,070
a modified<font color="#E5E5E5"> key that actually worked for</font>

869
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:05,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">it I wanted sure are you eating I</font>

870
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,609
because you're you're attacking each

871
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:11,019
year

872
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:12,519
and this demon uh no<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's because in</font>

873
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:15,999
the Mumbai movie method will push itself

874
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:17,680
back out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes like a my car</font>

875
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:19,660
tell them to hit it again sometimes

876
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,308
they'll all open but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it won't rotate</font>

877
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:25,749
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> putting very light</font>

878
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:28,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on it so but you can hit generally</font>

879
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:30,098
as much as you want that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

880
00:45:28,779 --> 00:45:31,180
like the minimal movement method more

881
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:49,029
because they could beat the shit out of

882
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:50,319
my locks oh you so wanted open oh it

883
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:54,579
might help if this key wasn't broken

884
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:57,549
right there yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright scratch that ah</font>

885
00:45:54,579 --> 00:46:04,119
put that then that locks sucked anyways

886
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:06,880
I didn't need to bump it you know should

887
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,890
bumping scare you what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think yeah</font>

888
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,119
I think that one is hopefully a

889
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">no-brainer but we'll go over it yes</font>

890
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:16,230
inexpensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> we bought a all these keys</font>

891
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,940
can be bought with ten dollar deadbolts

892
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:21,160
kwikset keys are very cheap quick that

893
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,920
sucks anyways but you know I like

894
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,259
knowing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could break them all</font>

895
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,730
inexpensive inconspicuous as fast as

896
00:46:26,259 --> 00:46:30,009
this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard would it be used to</font>

897
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:33,519
walk up to the locked room in not very

898
00:46:30,009 --> 00:46:34,839
hard hopefully but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will laugh one of</font>

899
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:39,189
you gets arrested pitcher pounding on

900
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:41,980
the damn thing very easy as I good

901
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:43,930
friend Alex Alex Alex helped us out with

902
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,700
he's never done this before is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this your</font>

903
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:50,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">first time learning log picking first</font>

904
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:58,808
time oh he's a virgin but now we busted

905
00:46:50,319 --> 00:47:02,589
his lock cherry with 22 I can take an

906
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:04,239
advantage of yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the USA very few</font>

907
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:07,150
locks offer protection this lage is a

908
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,559
standard doorknob that you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> find oh and</font>

909
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:10,599
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out security pins</font>

910
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,069
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter because you're bumping them</font>

911
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,509
all and they're jumping before they're

912
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:15,339
getting turned they're not going to

913
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:17,029
catch unless you're putting excessive to

914
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:19,909
work on it in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font>

915
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:21,619
you shouldn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyways but yeah</font>

916
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:24,199
because most wage doorknobs will come

917
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:26,509
with security pins but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

918
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:27,769
matter our lockbox that we made back

919
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:32,029
here that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be put up after the</font>

920
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:33,319
talk I have we rearranged all the

921
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:37,219
security pins in all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a bum</font>

922
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:39,469
bum all so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal but</font>

923
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:40,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's for picking not for bumping but</font>

924
00:47:39,469 --> 00:47:42,559
you could bump it if you feel so

925
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:44,900
inclined just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get anything stuck</font>

926
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:47,659
it off to hurt you<font color="#CCCCCC"> or have my good</font>

927
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,939
friend Alex he hurt you remember and

928
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:52,009
there's also insurance problems if I

929
00:47:49,939 --> 00:47:54,169
break into<font color="#E5E5E5"> strands apartment which which</font>

930
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:59,239
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know one of these keys may work</font>

931
00:47:54,169 --> 00:48:00,799
on any and i just opened it looks to

932
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:01,880
insurance company as if you left your

933
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:03,799
door open you left your door unlocked

934
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,079
how are they going to know unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

935
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:07,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">like blatantly like so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do break</font>

936
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,359
into apartments<font color="#E5E5E5"> i make sure to throw</font>

937
00:48:07,729 --> 00:48:15,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">bricks through the windows just just to</font>

938
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:17,630
make sure everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can be happy</font>

939
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:20,089
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a major problem especially for</font>

940
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:22,189
businesses like I was telling people

941
00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:23,900
yesterday every lock on this block and

942
00:48:22,189 --> 00:48:25,759
probably most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the city is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slave's</font>

943
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,519
doorknob how many doors do you think I

944
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:35,569
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> open with this key most of them</font>

945
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:37,549
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah asterisk yeah big problem</font>

946
00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:39,288
especially for businesses for your home

947
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:41,719
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have anything important I</font>

948
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:44,989
mean I I'd die if all these locks<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

949
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:47,390
gone the next day but it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very big</font>

950
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:49,279
problem for businesses especially so yes

951
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:52,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">bumping should scare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and why is</font>

952
00:48:49,279 --> 00:48:54,799
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> being done well it can be done</font>

953
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the use of sidebars like we</font>

954
00:48:54,799 --> 00:49:00,199
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ossa v10 that's a good</font>

955
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:02,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea but not if you screw it up because</font>

956
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:04,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this now all we need to do is find a key</font>

957
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:06,349
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the right sidebar for the</font>

958
00:49:04,279 --> 00:49:08,569
region and you cut the top pins to be a

959
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:11,179
bump key and when you insert it the side

960
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:13,519
of our will work as designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

961
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:15,589
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even have to manipulate it so</font>

962
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,538
that's bad but the medical locks are all

963
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:21,589
much better at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sidebar especially</font>

964
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:24,259
with the biopsy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh rotation and then</font>

965
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:26,140
there's a thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> trap pins why are</font>

966
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:35,849
my pictures not working

967
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:35,848
oh no oh seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep doing that oh</font>

968
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:50,019
but all these are gone that sucks all

969
00:49:39,279 --> 00:50:00,400
right you don't get along<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch</font>

970
00:49:50,019 --> 00:50:02,500
this is gonna be overly it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

971
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">noted that this is not my money my real</font>

972
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,660
OS I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just couldn't find anything else</font>

973
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:12,609
all right oh oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> no we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going back</font>

974
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:15,160
we're going back all right so you can

975
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:20,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">see be a demonstration of it pushing up</font>

976
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,190
and then push you back and then Oh pwned

977
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:30,849
so we went over sidebars trap pins and

978
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:33,880
that's fierce-looking lock in it so the

979
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:37,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is when you have the key that's</font>

980
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:40,029
what happens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens because as</font>

981
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:42,038
you asked earlier hikari the key holds

982
00:50:40,029 --> 00:50:43,809
that top it in place so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it passes</font>

983
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,779
by that that pin isn't going to fall

984
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:49,710
back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and when you bump it</font>

985
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:54,150
that put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that piece stays in place and</font>

986
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:54,150
yeah what's the problem with this

987
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:00,380
yeah you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drill this lockout now</font>

988
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,930
there's no way to get that out unless

989
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:05,150
you drill it and people have tried crazy

990
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:08,210
amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> old school lock locksmithing</font>

991
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:10,640
techniques you have to drill the pin out

992
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:13,130
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that trap in catches you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font>

993
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,450
the lockout excuse me and that's

994
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:17,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to do</font>

995
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:19,460
every time we bump a lock so a very

996
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:21,620
elegant way of doing it is shadow

997
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:24,740
drilling normally all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chambers are</font>

998
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:28,190
drilled to the same where is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouse</font>

999
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:30,049
depth here they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and</font>

1000
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:33,320
shadow drilling is when you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1001
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:35,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this see that the fourth one is a</font>

1002
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,690
bit higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen is that</font>

1003
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">your bump key is at the lowest pin depth</font>

1004
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:42,800
but that pin will rest slightly higher

1005
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:46,250
so when you bump it it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1006
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:50,750
get touched a very easy thing to do very

1007
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:53,990
elegant it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also is a very small way of</font>

1008
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:56,360
defending against picking but very easy

1009
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:58,729
but no one very<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only cava is</font>

1010
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:02,020
doing it as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I know and that's a</font>

1011
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:07,760
European company that you never heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1012
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:10,640
bumping specifically but assume that in

1013
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,680
some situations it helps like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1014
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,660
fourth pin if we go in with a pic to

1015
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,700
push that one up we'd have to hit the

1016
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,980
third pin and that might push it over

1017
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,189
the shear line the bottom pin over the

1018
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:24,170
shoe line so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't that make sense</font>

1019
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:28,780
yeah but mainly a defense against

1020
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:32,350
bumping legal issues don't be a criminal

1021
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:34,820
end up like me getting kidding

1022
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:37,400
purchasing from state to state it

1023
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,530
differs of the legality of owning either

1024
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock picking equipment or bumping</font>

1025
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:44,810
equipment generally anywhere you're

1026
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:49,880
eligible if you're a lock manufacturers

1027
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:52,400
such as a medico or off whatever you're

1028
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,890
in law enforcement you're an automobile

1029
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,840
dealer because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have very supposedly</font>

1030
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:59,259
type programs on the release of locks

1031
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:03,530
and keys and that sort of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

1032
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:06,650
repossession if you're a repo dude or if

1033
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,000
you're certified locksmith and with the

1034
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,839
advent of the internet if you're a bum

1035
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,940
like me

1036
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:15,920
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get lockpicks to and possession</font>

1037
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:18,559
generally they're legal right here is or

1038
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:24,589
mostly all my locks some donated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1039
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City of Pasadena but but generally</font>

1040
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:29,180
the rule is you're not going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1041
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:31,219
trouble unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you show intent right</font>

1042
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:34,368
here it's fine I might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call the</font>

1043
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:36,229
cops on you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for opening my locks but if</font>

1044
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:38,509
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and try and open locks</font>

1045
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:40,598
down the block that'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

1046
00:53:38,509 --> 00:53:45,049
because then you do look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a criminal</font>

1047
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:47,239
so just be logical don't be an idiot and

1048
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:48,829
you won't get arrested and like I said

1049
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:52,880
bring a brick when you break into houses

1050
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:54,799
so kidding kidding so what are good

1051
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,960
lucks what are affordable good locks

1052
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:58,849
that you could buy there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

1053
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">than this that are very very good locks</font>

1054
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:05,059
but these in my opinion are the most

1055
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:07,969
cost-effective the<font color="#CCCCCC"> medico by oxy old pin</font>

1056
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:10,579
locks like we showed earlier very good

very good madekwe is a solid company

1062
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:30,319
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of here is a very good block</font>

1072
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:54,549
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1073
