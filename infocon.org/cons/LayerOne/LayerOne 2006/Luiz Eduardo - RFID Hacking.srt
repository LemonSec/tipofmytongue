power conversion today we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,970
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> our physical security solutions we</font>

5
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,010
bought a company called netbotz<font color="#CCCCCC"> in late</font>

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,200
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year at around october november i</font>

7
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,570
was planning on having a demo for you

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shipped me the wrong rack so</font>

9
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,380
we don't have a live demo the good news

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,570
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remembered that we actually</font>

11
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a demo website where we can</font>

12
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:09,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what the appliance</font>

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,350
looks like and how it behaves and look

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,290
at someone's environment the netbotz

15
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,839
demo lab so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to do that maybe talk</font>

16
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:18,310
a little bit about pulling a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked me pulling questions so I'm</font>

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:26,110
assuming that's still pretty hot well no

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,910
pun intended topic so basically a lot of

20
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,979
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

21
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,860
today from a security perspective have

22
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:36,130
been about the network and securing the

23
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,710
network but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we view there being</font>

24
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,560
this area of security that it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

25
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,419
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be paying attention to and that would</font>

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,420
be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical security everything in</font>

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,940
the physical layer and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC sees itself</font>

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,570
as a physical layer company so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

29
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,429
what we see our products doing is is you

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,100
know bridging that gap between physical

31
00:01:54,429 --> 00:02:00,780
security and IT security we do that

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,580
using the net box appliance solution so

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,700
you know a little bit about what's going

34
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,889
on in our environment you know rising

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,290
densities he's becoming an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

36
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,779
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the risk to your IT</font>

37
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,630
assets not only from physical sabotage

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,560
but from heat water smoke or any of

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">these other types of issues so and we</font>

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,270
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a little demo so the</font>

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,580
area is where we see risk our

42
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:34,870
environmental human error theft and of

43
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">course your favorite sabotage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

44
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,709
encounter any of these error and any of

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:46,359
these problems in their environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

46
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:49,599
so basically netbox houses are the APC

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,410
has a solution on this netbotz product

48
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,510
where it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera and pods</font>

49
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:59,359
illusion we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have the camera</font>

50
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:01,370
go and and alert you based on rather you

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,710
can get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse from the system based on</font>

52
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,430
events so for instance gets too hot in

53
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the room you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an alert right</font>

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,690
someone opens the door to the server

55
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:14,270
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone touches opens the door to a</font>

56
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,010
wrap or maybe even we've got a camera

57
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,720
focusing on this whole room but we're

58
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,970
only interested in what happens if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,550
walk by this area right here so with the

60
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ipod the the net box solution does</font>

61
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,900
is it pretty much goes and has the

62
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,420
camera they are all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> alerts you</font>

63
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,710
based on the event and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

64
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,970
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see what might have</font>

65
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:36,980
happened so the solution comes in a few

66
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,280
different models the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high end being the</font>

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,500
the 500 I've got specs sheets I'm not

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,990
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflix expert but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of devices that you can put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

70
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,040
there in types of contacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

71
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,440
measurements are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much limitless</font>

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,630
any type of dry contact sensor<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

73
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,459
work on this the camera lenses are

74
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,380
pretty straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> generic camera</font>

75
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,950
lenses so you can change out the camera

76
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,410
lenses to the appropriate type there's

77
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,049
also centralized appliance to aggregate

78
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:10,900
or manage the data from net boxes all

79
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:13,400
cross a a network environment LAN LAN so

80
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,579
centralizing the you know the solutions

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,739
also manage all the APC legacy or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC</font>

82
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,589
devices and the APC infrastructure

83
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:25,310
manager can now also manage the the net

84
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch the bots devices so that's a</font>

85
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,540
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about what the the</font>

86
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,370
architecture looks like you can see the

87
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,160
wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots and really that's just whether</font>

88
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,900
we we put in a rackmount kit or a wall

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,290
kit whether we call it netbotz or wall

90
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">BOTS you can see that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

91
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,730
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of sensors out there and</font>

92
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,280
how they communicate you can either talk

93
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,900
directly to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net box or</font>

94
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,210
communicate back to the central server

95
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:55,460
if you're aggregating or managing a lot

96
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:56,539
of these devices of course it wouldn't

97
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,599
be fun if you couldn't look at it

98
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">through your PDA so even on this link</font>

99
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,030
i'm going to show you on when I

100
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,009
live demo you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much go and if</font>

101
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,750
you can get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the website you can</font>

102
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:13,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view what happened on your PDA so</font>

103
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,310
that's it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the netbotz presentation</font>

104
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,580
stuff i'm going to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys what</font>

105
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:22,780
this thing looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like real quickly this</font>

106
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:25,000
is at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> net box of facility in in</font>

107
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,229
austin texas at our headquarters and

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what you're seeing is a</font>

109
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,818
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know the the copy center</font>

110
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,800
but we can have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup so that</font>

111
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone touched</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the copier or if the</font>

112
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,830
temperature changed you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an alert</font>

113
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,199
from an alerting perspective we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

114
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">just get it on on temperature change or</font>

115
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,789
humidity but it can be rate of change so

116
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,860
gradual change might not be bad but a

117
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,199
quick spike in temperature of 10 degrees

118
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,270
might be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do want to manage</font>

119
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,770
this comes in real handy the other day

120
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,330
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and figure out whether</font>

121
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,210
someone's chiller tower for their air

122
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,099
conditioning was was they wanted to know

123
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,989
when the pumps go bad so how do you

124
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:03,460
check that will check<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on rate of</font>

125
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,020
change how quickly does the room

126
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:11,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">temperature change so the I don't know</font>

127
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:16,180
why my screen keeps popping like this

128
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:18,129
but just to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys a flavor for</font>

129
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,150
the type of things that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do over</font>

130
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:24,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">here the system also has has a speaker's</font>

131
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,330
type of setup when you get it were and

132
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,180
we're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some integration where</font>

133
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:33,188
you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call out</font>

134
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,199
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like fire alert so you can see</font>

135
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,610
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full</font>

136
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,110
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

137
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:42,189
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and show you the rate of change</font>

138
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:48,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the camera stuff right now any</font>

139
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:50,949
questions on the net box stuff yes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

140
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,449
there's there's two ways I believe

141
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,370
there's two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manage it once be a</font>

142
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:58,449
web-based and then there's a client that

143
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it as well with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

144
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,350
rack box

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,570
so does I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a camera built into it</font>

146
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:09,200
yeah so the appliance we can probably

147
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,260
drill back into that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

148
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,640
appliance pretty much can go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a in a</font>

149
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,930
wall box because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to look</font>

150
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,190
at the nightie room<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

151
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,140
to mount it on a wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look down on</font>

152
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,460
it but we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a mounting kit where</font>

153
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,330
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> mount it in the rack looking</font>

154
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,969
into the rack so that's that's the rack

155
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:31,430
the netbox version the wall box is the

156
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:33,320
other one you can see it on the wall and

157
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,170
then the rack boxes with the rack mount

158
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,570
it's basically a rackmount kit any other

159
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,000
questions on the net box stuff it's

160
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,590
going to drill I got a couple more

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,780
minutes I was going to drill into a

162
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,580
little bit of power and cooling type of

163
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,440
stuff it seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cooling was the</font>

164
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:54,880
biggest question I got in the other room

165
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:57,110
I do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> glossies and slot and</font>

166
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,540
paperwork on the net box stuff if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

167
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,800
interested so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel free to go and</font>

168
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,720
grab some<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll leave that stuff behind</font>

169
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:09,380
I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stay here for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

170
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:11,450
until about 2 30 at the latest we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

171
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,120
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through about 60 slides in about the</font>

172
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,680
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

173
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,570
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about this is</font>

174
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,520
probably what we would consider a legacy

175
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,830
style<font color="#CCCCCC"> UPS if you open up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cabinet</font>

176
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,560
you'd find something equivalent to car

177
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:27,680
batteries and ours is kind of a module

178
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,620
or pay-as-you-go approach a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

179
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,380
of any PC revenues doubt anyone's

180
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,650
interested in that are our basic

181
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,979
go-to-market strategy is everything

182
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,390
physical layer so the netbotz

183
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,430
acquisition fits real well within the

184
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">company's the company's go-to-market</font>

185
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">strategy of letting you manage your</font>

186
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:52,790
physical environment be a power be

187
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,100
cooling be you know racks and

188
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:58,459
centralizing that management platform so

189
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:02,150
our portfolio of products is pretty much

190
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">n to n physical layer where your</font>

191
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,819
equipment lives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> reads and are our</font>

192
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,450
priority is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring a standards-based</font>

193
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,190
approach to physical layer another

194
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,730
words will go into this a little bit

195
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,920
more you know today if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

196
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a PC the way data centers bill it's</font>

197
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,380
pretty much custom from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

198
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,840
ground up so the business case behind

199
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is because anyone here designing</font>

200
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">their car customer or do you go to the</font>

201
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,720
car dealership and tell them what

202
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,500
options you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want in it and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

203
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,180
there's some benefits in in in

204
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,000
standardizing you'll eliminate one time

205
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,229
engineering and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost associated with</font>

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,030
it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know lower that the time to to</font>

207
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,760
build the solution have something that's

208
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,010
tested and proven as opposed to relying

209
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,670
on contractors and consulting engineers

210
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:58,250
to reinvent the wheel every single time

211
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,500
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do we think we can do</font>

212
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:04,000
by having a modular redundant approaches

213
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,620
is basically lower the<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise the</font>

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,770
reliability of the equipment lower the

215
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:14,000
meantime to recovery reduce human error

216
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:16,340
significantly so our approach is an

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">integrated solution of rack power</font>

218
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,820
pulling and we it comes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

219
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,170
different sizes from upper left which

220
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,570
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your closet all the way down to</font>

221
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:29,689
a lower right which would be a fairly

222
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:32,180
large data center and the heart<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

223
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,970
or one of the heart<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that would be the</font>

224
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,829
the UPS design so our UPS design is

225
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,540
similar to buying a large Cisco switch

226
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,210
or a raid array where it's redundant

227
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,579
hot-swappable modules so from the top

228
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,920
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> its redundant supervisor modules</font>

229
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,710
redundant power modules and then n plus

230
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,780
one type of configuration so if you lose

231
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,180
a power module you're so up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

232
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:58,189
on condition power you just need a hot

233
00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:00,589
swap and replace it there's some

234
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,840
challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see that that</font>

235
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,820
companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> facing or you know in</font>

236
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,880
fiscal environment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're really</font>

237
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,550
rapid changes in IT technology

238
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-density operating costs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

239
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,880
increasing availability expectations and

240
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,220
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by delivering a scalable</font>

241
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,150
solution with the page grow model that

242
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,380
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can leave and leave it eliminate</font>

243
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,880
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those there's problems so we're</font>

244
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to jump in the cooling real quick</font>

245
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,410
with our hot aisle containment solution

246
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,709
which basically to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the heart</font>

247
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,630
of our integration of of our modular

248
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,280
approach we basically take our air

249
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,290
conditioner put it in row as close to

250
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,170
the possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the heat source put the</font>

251
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,449
racks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ups all in the in a contained</font>

252
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,160
solution by doing that it's the kind of

253
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:52,890
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can drop in for disaster</font>

254
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:55,709
recovery or a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> location and again</font>

255
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,960
there's no no need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> design anything</font>

256
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,030
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing this needs is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its chilled</font>

257
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,710
water feed for cooling and its power

258
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,790
feed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> powered you can drop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a</font>

259
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,570
room like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've pretty much</font>

260
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:09,959
got a ready to go data center so power

261
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,700
distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the heart</font>

262
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,490
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we like to do is give better</font>

263
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,880
tools for management to our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

264
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:19,140
our rack mount power PT use come in you

265
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,880
know two flavors that would interest you

266
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,010
a metered one where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can balance your</font>

267
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,750
power by phases I mean more importantly

268
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,810
a switch one so that if you have a hung

269
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:31,380
device you can remotely go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> log into</font>

270

<font color="#CCCCCC">your VPN log into the power strip or pdu</font>

271
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,520
and power cycle a server<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be</font>

272
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,319
hung just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn off those specific</font>

receptacles for that piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of equipment</font>

274
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,310
we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of work with regard to</font>

275
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,020
cooling and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest challenge of</font>

276
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're seeing is the increasing heat</font>

277
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,910
densities so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best way to</font>

278
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,560
solve that is make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're setting</font>

279
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,630
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> your rooms in the hot oil called I'll</font>

the first place I'd look is blanking

285
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,910
panels if you don't have blanking panels

286
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,010
and you've got a rack set up without

287
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,050
blanking panels the cold air can escape

288
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,970
right from the front to the rear it's

289
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,069
easier to pass through a blank area of

290
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Iraq than it is to pass through a piece</font>

291
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,200
of server equipment so blanking panels

292
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,850
are key eliminating the heat trapping

293
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,190
the heat and getting it back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air</font>

294
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,140
conditioner is is probably the best

295
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,770
solution so what you want to do is

296
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,180
eliminate air mixing and get your the

297
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,259
hottest possible heir to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> air</font>

298
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,439
conditioner

299
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:39,029
we do that well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at Point</font>

300
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:40,679
solutions that don't fit into the rest

301
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:43,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the world like Cisco switches the</font>

302
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,850
cool side to side and we have a solution

303
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:47,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will take that hot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> air and push it</font>

304
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,559
to the back if you have issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

305
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,589
that solution in the middle the solution

306
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the far right it deals with raised</font>

307
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:56,549
for and temperature gradients if you

308
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:57,809
have a temperature gradient where you're

309
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:59,759
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold air to the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

310
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,559

311
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,410
channel of cold air up the front and

312
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:07,829
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air you is on the far left</font>

313
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,569
is our air removal unit the basic piece

314
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:12,358
of math you want to walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away with is</font>

315
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:15,929
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes about 160 CFM of airflow</font>

316
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:17,549
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool one kilowatt so you know if we</font>

317
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">can increase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of air passing</font>

319
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:23,699
the rack we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> include we can improve</font>

320
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:25,649
your calling cooling performance so

321
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:26,939
we've got these rear doors that are the

322
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,189
kind of thing you better blade ready

323
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:31,019
you'd add to an existing rack that can

324
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:33,149
deliver anywhere between 12 hundred and

325
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,839
twenty 400 CFM depending on the model

326
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:40,199
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could duck that right back up to</font>

327
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,730
the hot air return so we don't believe

328
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,079
in putting fans at the top of the rack

329
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,999
because the equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> close front the</font>

330
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,679
back we believe in taking that air and

00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:52,259
dumping it right back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the air</font>

337
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,859
apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> for not having the demo for</font>

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys I was really hoping to be able</font>

339
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:12,749
to show you the net box stuff but I've

340
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,969
got some some product literature I've

341
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:16,799
got a systems engineer that's netbox

342
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,779
expert<font color="#E5E5E5"> that loves to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

343
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,939
stuff we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make himself him available</font>

344
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,199
if you guys have any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if you</font>

345
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this would solve any of your</font>

346
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:32,130
problems any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

347
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:36,140
okay how about that I was curious

348
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:41,070
whether agency and work towards making

349
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:42,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dc-7 reality well you know it's it's</font>

350
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,690
tough i I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing this for a year</font>

351
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:48,230
to happen and I've had one customer

352
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,420
asked me about DC in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeframe and</font>

353
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,370
we have a fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> small set of DC</font>

354
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,229
offerings but we have it but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue</font>

355
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,000
is this you know when you're running

356
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,070
your piece of IT equipment and you're

357
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,790
putting it on the ups and it's a larger

358
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:05,430
UPS your UPS converts from AC to DC from

359
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,319
DC back to AC then it goes into a power

360
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,279
supply in the server which can convert

361
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,269
it back to DC again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very efficient</font>

362
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,390
inefficient and it generates additional

363
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:18,570
heat so if you could run it all on DC

364
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:22,880
that would be great the downside though

365
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:29,250
is is it to run it on DC you need to

366
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:31,050
basically have everything fused it's not

367
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,300
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an AC circuit and you plug it</font>

368
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,849
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a DC bus there's fuses between</font>

369
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,439
each bus or device so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

370
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,720
commonplace the only place you really

371
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">see a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of that is in a telephoto type</font>

372
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,950
of environment and they have a

373
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,709
certification they called nebs and it's

374
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:50,940
a certification that picked that means a

375
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:52,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot for your rack bracing and in your</font>

376
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,160
power and they run at negative 48 volt

377
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,010
but we have offerings in that space just

378
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,899
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it there's not demand for it to</font>

379
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:05,730
make us increase and and add to that

00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:08,819
offerings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I answered that any</font>

383
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,730
off if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get your card in here</font>

384
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,880
then get this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> raffled off right</font>

385
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,880
now

386
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,399
well just rip off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the piece of paper</font>

387
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:29,700
you'll be the only one with one of those

388
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:37,490
put your name on it here I'll give you a

393
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:50,340
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm here to talk a little bit</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID technologies mostly on the</font>

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology security is I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

396
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit about security of course</font>

397
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:02,219
you but the main thing is RFID many

398
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,049
people talked about RFID already they're

399
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,820
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some really good</font>

400
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:07,830
presentations around you can find on the

401
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,960
internet from other conferences and

402
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:14,149
stuff what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to focus is on the</font>

403
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:20,760
Wi-Fi tags which is a kind of of a new

404
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:23,100
technology that is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used so again</font>

405
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk a little bit about the</font>

406
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:29,840
history of rfid if you're not familiar

407
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:34,440
with that technologies the types of rfid

408
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:37,230
technologies that exist today talk try

409
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,539
to cover more the Wi-Fi tags how they

410
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:44,730
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first and second generation</font>

411
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:47,429
that are out there and then privacy and

412
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,470
security for both for for the older or

413
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:54,929
the legacy stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then your stuff</font>

414
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:57,149
that is out a little bit about me I'm

415
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:59,909
mostly an app working guy been working

416
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:02,100
with networks forever really enjoy the

417
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:05,549
top from<font color="#E5E5E5"> n.o because there is to work</font>

418
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:10,760
with mpls and all that stuff then being

419
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:14,158
involved with security<font color="#CCCCCC"> sinks 95-96 then</font>

420
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,850
started working with Wi-Fi networks then

421
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:22,740
securities is there had to learn on the

422
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,418
hard way<font color="#CCCCCC"> or any way and spoke at some</font>

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:48,390
so let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it RFID so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it it</font>

430
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:52,350
stands for radio frequency

431
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:56,360
identification meaning RF radio

432
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:58,740
frequency is waves in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the air and</font>

433
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:05,280
identification this to identify stuff

434
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:08,700
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it is derived from or the</font>

435
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,250
first type of RFID that it is really not

436
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">RFID but on the radar systems they</font>

437
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:19,710
started using identification based on

438
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:25,680
aircraft so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify if if a plane</font>

439
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:31,260
was a friend or foe in 1945 the Soviet

440
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:35,340
government they used a convert listening

441
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:38,129
device which is not RFID tag by any

442
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,580
means but it works in a similar way so

443
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:45,200
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to reference that as well as</font>

444
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:49,260
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the history of RFID</font>

445
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:55,260
the first commercial use of other was in

446
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:59,430
1976 and anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what project used</font>

447
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,980
that nobody chewing gum juicy fruit

448
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:05,540
teaming up that was the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID</font>

449
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,540
application commercial

450
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:13,950
the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfid kind of works so if</font>

451
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,410
you're not familiar to it nowadays

452
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,260
almost everybody is but the easiest ways

453
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,930
you're not familiar to it to kind of

454
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,730
relate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is is the entire map</font>

455
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,620
tags that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have when you buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

456
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,100
you want to store the difference is that

457
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:32,070
depth tagged and try to have tags what

458
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,870
they have is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 0 or 1 you paid for it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

459
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,360
you didn't pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so when you go to</font>

460
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:38,699
the register it says you paid for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

461
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,050
it changes them it flips that bit when

462
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,450
you walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the door there's the</font>

463
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,770
sensor if you pay it doesn't go off if

464
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:48,380
you didn't pay of course it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

465
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:51,110
go off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference from RFID is that</font>

466
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">RFID stores much more information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

467
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">one bit I don't remember now the number</font>

468
00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:01,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits i think it's about 20 bits or</font>

469
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:05,040
something like that mostly used today as

470
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:08,430
inventory control some people say it's

471
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,100
it could be or it will one day be a bar

472
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,900
called replacement but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's</font>

473
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard at this point but you never</font>

474
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,910
know but the idea is that for a barcode

475
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,130
reader<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need the the reader has to</font>

476
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:26,580
see the barcode of course you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need-</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

477
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:28,440
for rfid<font color="#CCCCCC"> no and more in the application</font>

478
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,350
side why do you need that<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do you</font>

479
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,220
want that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our large stores and stuff</font>

480
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:39,179
like that is to to know where products

481
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:42,240
are so if you with a reader you can its

482
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,630
inventory control to know where this

483
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,650
this turf is and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can seem</font>

484
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:52,080
to have more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the on the</font>

485
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,780
tag you can know not only what product

486
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,139
it is but expiration dates and stuff

487
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,810
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes it easier easier</font>

488
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,820
for tracking so the whole point of RFID

489
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,820
is tracking and identifying stuff

490
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,870
so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID technology what what it</font>

491
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:17,470
is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the tags also known</font>

492
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,020
known as transponders that can be active

493
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:23,140
same semi active or passive we're going

494
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:28,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk a little bit about that in a few</font>

495
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:31,410
slides the mole the frequencies used is

496
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:35,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the low frequency high frequency and</font>

497
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:40,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">ultra-high frequency and microwave and</font>

498
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:44,530
some are GPS so some RFIDs today then

499
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:47,799
some of them they're only<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS or they</font>

500
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:51,520
mix some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of legacy or Wi-Fi with</font>

501
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:56,020
GPS so it cars and stuff can be tracked

502
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,850
by by GPS you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have the readers or</font>

503
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,450
transceivers that's what gets the

504
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:03,540
information from the tag and you have

505
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend systems which correlate</font>

506
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,780
which are going to correlate the

507
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:16,270
information collected and do whatever

508
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:19,330
they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that some some stuff</font>

509
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:22,660
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tags most of the tags that are</font>

510
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,939
out there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not read only they</font>

511
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:29,130
have the support up to a thousand write

512
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:32,140
cycles that means you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuse it</font>

513
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,780
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security some of them have</font>

514
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,830
some sort of raipur protection but not

515
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and each tag carries a</font>

516
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:47,199
unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier which is probably</font>

517
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:50,470
heard about it is the UTC now talking a

518
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,679
little bit about the Wi-Fi tags most of

519
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:57,160
them the idea is ease of use for the

520
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:02,799
they're programmed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rtls which is</font>

521
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:05,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route forgot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is real time</font>

522
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,510
location system or server so the tag

523
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,280
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in details how it</font>

524
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,750
works but pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tag that the</font>

525
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,139
tag associated with a Wi-Fi network

526
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,950
there's a back-end<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTLS that will</font>

527
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,510
configure the tag

528
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,830
or change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration that topped</font>

529
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:24,570
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's most important to you and</font>

530
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:28,230
a little bit about securities that the

531
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:30,870
newer tags that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see one yet but</font>

532
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:35,250
was reading on the internet some cheap

533
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:37,379
vendor is to put another cheap for

534
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,669
crypto acceleration because that's one

535
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:48,860
of the overheads when you talk about

536
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:53,130
security about RFID is encryption so

537
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:55,229
some myths about RFID one of them I

538
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,370
talked a little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is is it</font>

539
00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:02,760
going to replace barcode yes or no I

540
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:07,049
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is yes but let's see when</font>

541
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:12,090
it's going to happen I'll hear it here

542
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:14,158
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they think RFID con can store lots</font>

543
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,080
of information so I said 20 bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

544
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,809
not 20 bits 20 beats i think is the epc

545
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:25,559
it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2k of information this is on</font>

546
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:27,928
a one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> legacy tags and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> band</font>

547
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,870
there is that big one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say</font>

548
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:32,190
okay so the passive tags they're

549
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,949
supposed to be read from a short

550
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:38,580
distance from let's say from passports

551
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,230
they say a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> centimetres to I don't</font>

552
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">know some sort of other tags that are</font>

553
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,590
for inventory and stuff where you have

554
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:48,809
the scanners that the gates that have

555
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:51,658
the sensors up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two metres but there</font>

556
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:54,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">are like experiments that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> showed that I</font>

557
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:58,020
think the record<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a Def Con last year</font>

558
00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:00,510
that they were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read to activate</font>

559
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:04,400
a tag and read information from the tag

560
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,400
from 69 feet or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that</font>

561
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:14,549
so here we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking a little bit</font>

562
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:19,360
about the differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the legacy</font>

563
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:23,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">RFID tags and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Wi-Fi months so the</font>

564
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,649
legacy ones most of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> are used as</font>

565
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:28,780
passive rfid tags so how does it work

566
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:30,160
why is it passive because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

567
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">have power it doesn't have a power</font>

568
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,600
supply a power source so it activates

569
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,820
when it gets close to the reader the

570
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">reader activates their clarified</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> etag</font>

571
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,049
and once it activates that then it can

572
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:46,990
read information from<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sends then the</font>

573
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:48,879
bag sends information to the reader so

574
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:53,919
back a little bit on what i was talking

575
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,870
here the short distance think so there

576
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,610
are two ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> also write what they did at</font>

577
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that point is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they had two antennas</font>

578
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,709
one to activate the tag that was almost

579
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,120
70 feet away and the other one to read

580
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,909
the information that was sent by the

581
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,860
time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hand if you just want</font>

582
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:11,289
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eavesdrop you just want to see</font>

583
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">information if somebody's gotta get</font>

584
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:17,020
access control to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company and have</font>

585
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,419
the RFID badge if you're either<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

586
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,400
many meters away or feet away you can

587
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:23,049
read information you cannot activate the

588
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,169
tag if you don't need to activate the

589
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:27,280
tag because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transplant the</font>

590
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">transceiver is gonna activate it for you</font>

591
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:36,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just listen to the information so</font>

592
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:41,610
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this slide so the usual RFID</font>

593
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:46,629
tags they work at 9 915 megahertz

594
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:49,780
they're inexpensive somehow they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

595
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:53,919
about five cents to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 cents that's what</font>

596
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:56,230
I saw looking on the internet and so

597
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,450
they have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> batteries and in theory</font>

598
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:04,150
they are supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work in a very</font>

599
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:07,270
short range used in most products that

600
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:11,770
probably you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy today not most but lots</font>

601
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:15,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the idea is from large stores is</font>

602
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:18,410
to have RFID in all the products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

603
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:21,740
probably you heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> or read about</font>

604
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:24,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't some people are really</font>

605
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:27,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned about privacy and people don't</font>

606
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to don't like the idea of having</font>

607
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:33,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that on other projects that you buy but</font>

608
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:37,100
in another way many stores do that today

609
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:40,639
with credit cards and and customer

610
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:46,550
loyalty cards and all that stuff what

611
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:50,240
else so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is you the reader</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

612
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:53,659
to be closed somehow close to the to the

613
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,210
to the RF to the bag so if you're

614
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,800
there's a truck the truck has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

615
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,590
through a gate and the gate has many

616
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,419
sensors if you have a ballot and the

617
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:05,360
ballot has to have some sort of reader

618
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,820
to see what it's carrying and send that

619
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a back-end system and then it could</font>

620
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:14,600
be even a combination of Wi-Fi and RFID

621
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,790
but not on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID side there are</font>

622
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">people there what they're doing now is</font>

623
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:21,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they have some sort of rfid reader</font>

624
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,990
on a pallet and then via Wi-Fi sends

625
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,389
information back to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

626
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:32,990
that sends to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backend server to do</font>

627
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:40,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever has to do used in manufacturing</font>

628
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:42,440
and retail<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

629
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:46,040
applications or where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been used but</font>

630
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,300
also passports and the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in</font>

631
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:52,300
all kinds of stuff clothes money

632
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,300
everything

633
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:01,680
about the Wi-Fi tags they work at the

634
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:05,639
2.4 gigahertz frequency so they're just

635
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">a Wi-Fi device they are more expensive</font>

636
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:13,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">way more expensive than a than a a</font>

637
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:16,620
passive device I have two of them here

638
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:18,780
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first generation one little</font>

639
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,600
bigger if you want to track people or

640
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:26,120
stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of big and this is the</font>

641
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,169
second generation one little smaller and

642
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk about the difference</font>

643
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:35,790
between first generation and second

644
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:37,620
generation as well so the cool thing

645
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,909
about the Wi-Fi tags is that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

646
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,469
it existing infrastructure

647
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:47,400
infrastructure the Wi-Fi infrastructure

648
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:49,860
infrastructure so it's a good thing and

649
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:53,670
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us in the security field</font>

650
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,500
it's another concern or another one of

651
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,000
those things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about how can I</font>

652
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,410
break them sort and stuff like that

653
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover that in a little bit it's</font>

654
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">been mostly used in hospitals where they</font>

655
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,790
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to they have to use the Wi-Fi</font>

656
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:13,350
network for many things already they use

657
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:17,730
it for to use voice over IP with the

658
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:21,000
electronic badges or white phones so

659
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:26,280
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using their existing Wi-Fi</font>

660
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,090
infrastructure to track other equipment

661
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:33,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also information</font>

662
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,919
about patients and stuff like that and

663
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:43,540
anything interesting there no want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

664
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,950
talk how they work

665
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:50,000
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty much how it works that</font>

666
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:52,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> uhf rfid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you have the reader</font>

667
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,870
on the right side there the reader is

668
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,580
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information from there it's</font>

669
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,709
going to activate the tag the tag is

670
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,199
going to send its information through

671
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,750
some sort of network that really doesn't

672
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,300
matter it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to an ERP</font>

673
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,410
system more or first to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID server</font>

674
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,810
that is going to understand that

675
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,880
information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then that's probably</font>

676
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:13,489
talking to some sort of ERP system that

677
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,870
is one that is actually better<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the</font>

678
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:16,870
inventory<font color="#E5E5E5"> control and stuff like that</font>

679
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:29,360
what else when import important part is

680
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:32,418
that is the chunks of information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

681
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent is really small so there's a lot of</font>

682
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:41,658
transactions but really tiny chunks of

683
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:44,899
information bra possible problems with

684
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:47,090
that is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not guaranteed that we</font>

685
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:50,299
attack how many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to store</font>

686
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:52,429
even with the Untied<font color="#E5E5E5"> mapped tags that</font>

687
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,950
they do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it doesn't work or they</font>

688
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,870
they know already that it really doesn't

689
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,520
work that well<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you need to it a few</font>

690
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,750
times just to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the things</font>

691
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,720
not going to beep when you leave the

692
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:08,120
store right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

693
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:11,810
problems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole integration could</font>

694
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,250
be a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I know I believe if</font>

695
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:18,740
somebody knows what they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

696
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:23,780
shouldn't be a problem talking about the

697
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:26,540
Wi-Fi tags the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works it is is</font>

698
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,310
just another device so another important

699
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:33,110
point is that you could have a tag

700
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:34,970
talking to an RTLS server or you can

701
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,890
have any sort of Wi-Fi device running

702
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,779
some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> client so it can have a</font>

703
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:41,060
laptop being tracked you can have a PDA

704
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,190
being tracked you can have anything and

705
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,839
what type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information is being is</font>

706
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:52,010
sent to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtls server</font>

707
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:53,540
mostly nowadays and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

708
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,070
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump to the other slide no let</font>

709
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:58,520
me just see if there's something

710
00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:02,450
interesting here so one thing with the

711
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:06,020
Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> tags is number one it has a</font>

712
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:08,060
battery so the battery life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a</font>

713
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,369
concern it's rechargeable and all that

714
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:16,130
good stuff but could be a problem the

715
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:17,720
other thing is range it's just as I said

716
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,609
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just another Wi-Fi device so</font>

717
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,319
wherever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it had you can talk to</font>

718
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:26,869
on nexus point it's going to work

719
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:29,839
encryption could be a problem because

720
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:31,640
most and not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> but most of the</font>

721
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,700
existing Wi-Fi tags today to support

722
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:37,970
open system and web and needless to say

723
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:41,779
to to you guys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

724
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:44,629
secure but i found on the internet a

725
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:48,530
vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is is probably implementing</font>

726
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:51,440
it 02 11 i already which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

727
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">was impressive was expecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see some</font>

728
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of wpa pre-shared key but now it's</font>

729
00:36:53,660 --> 00:37:02,720
802 11 I an interesting thing about the

730
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:06,560
Wi-Fi tags 33 into Wi-Fi is that some of

731
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:10,180
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they support multiple ssids and on</font>

732
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,180
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide we're going to see</font>

733
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:20,660
matters is where it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

734
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:22,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">association what matters is like to put</font>

735
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,470
like this you can have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> access points</font>

736
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:26,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">support supposing that the access points</font>

737
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,368
do not support more than one SSID so you

738
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:31,190
have two access points but the end point

739
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:33,920
is the same network is the same path or

740
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:36,500
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of day bulb and end up talking to</font>

741
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rtls server the in the same network</font>

742
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,570
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool that attack can have</font>

743
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,169
multiple ssids because the way they

744
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,170
calculate

745
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:58,740
Sadie and you had some sort of network

746
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,129
that has in one area one SSID and

747
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:04,350
another area of other SSID that wouldn't

748
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:15,000
work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why if you have multiple</font>

749
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:19,140
ssids it's better and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok can go to the</font>

750
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,940
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so now everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I jumped</font>

751
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">before i'm going to talk about because</font>

752
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,630
it's easier here it's the way it works

753
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:32,600
so this tag for example the first

754
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:36,030
generation one it sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to</font>

755
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTLS server and who does all the</font>

756
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:41,970
calculations and stuff like that is the

757
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">RTLS server so it's sort of a pain in</font>

758
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:47,040
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you implement because</font>

759
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,709
you have to provisionally these tags on

760
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> archaeal a server to know say this</font>

761
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">tag is weeks for example i'm carrying</font>

762
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rtls servers knows that</font>

763
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,470
that's me and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information that</font>

764
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">is being sent by the tag is as I said</font>

765
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:08,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bssid information and RSSI the</font>

766
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:11,460
signal strength and and what access

767
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:16,590
point it's talking to or how or which

768
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,780
ones right can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than one and the</font>

769
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:21,510
tag has to associate to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

770
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,160
then do all these get all this

771
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:25,290
information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then sent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the server</font>

772
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,299
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to based on</font>

773
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:29,550
that information say oh he sent me

774
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,010
information from that and that bssid

775
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:35,160
from those aps so it must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

776
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and well-rounded there around</font>

777
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:41,640
their part is then on the RSSI on the

778
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,259
signal strength from each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EPS</font>

779
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,500
it's going to understand where that tag

780
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,500
is

781
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:52,999
the problem type of problem that there

782
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:55,130
is is one battery life because so you

783
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:58,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask me how often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does the tag send</font>

784
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:00,920
information to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network to the</font>

785
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,470
server it's it can be configured you can

786
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,859
say it's a clock link it's a timer think

787
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:09,259
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> X seconds or minutes you send</font>

788
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:11,299
information to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> wake up you send you</font>

789
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:17,210
from your associate and send information

790
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:18,880
to the server other ways and you know

791
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,720
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

792
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,999
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a timer thing it could be</font>

793
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">many things could be motion sensor some</font>

794
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:30,979
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they have motion sensors</font>

795
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensors so if it's not moving it's not</font>

796
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:34,249
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send anything but if you move</font>

797
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:40,220
it wakes up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those all the process</font>

798
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:42,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about but the overhead</font>

799
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:48,950
nowadays the overhead is this it has to

800
00:40:42,529 --> 00:40:54,710
associate to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network talking about</font>

801
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:56,598
the second generation it is it's a

802
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">little different so the infrastructure</font>

803
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:05,269
is pretty much the same the difference

804
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:08,569
is the way that the tag is worked so the

805
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:10,910
tag is going to wake the same way that I

806
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:14,269
described before either by timer or

807
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,308
motion sensor or any other sort of

808
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:18,529
sensor depends on the tag it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

809
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:20,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the application to be temperature sensor</font>

810
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:24,559
could be humidity sensor could be

811
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:28,519
anything and once it wakes up once it

812
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:30,950
blinks pretty much sends no frames the

813
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:34,098
Wi-Fi infrastructure that's going to

814
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:36,468
learn information from so it's a reverse

815
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:38,690
I think now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wi-Fi infrastructure</font>

816
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:40,039
is going to learn and the Wi-Fi

817
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,589
infrastructure is going to send

818
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,989
information to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtls server so it's</font>

819
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:48,890
based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same information bssid and</font>

820
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:51,319
RSSI but the eps are hussain information

821
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:53,650
to their<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTLS server via some sort of</font>

822
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:53,650
API

823
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:07,149
of course the idea in the future is to

824
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:10,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">integrate both of them I don't see this</font>

825
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:13,559
as a reality as of now but could be me

826
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:15,969
but the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some sort of</font>

827
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,569
access points that understand both of

828
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:22,029
them the passive and the UHF<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

829
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:24,069
Wi-Fi and gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> information from all of</font>

830
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:27,309
those and then send to whatever server

831
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:29,949
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send information to and not</font>

832
00:42:27,309 --> 00:42:31,989
only for tracking but for for the

833
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:34,569
inventory control and stuff like that by

834
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:39,219
the way the Wi-Fi tags are mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

835
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:42,038
for tracking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and identification not</font>

836
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:46,569
for even<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tori and stuff like that some</font>

837
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:49,630
marks I think someone amusement park and

838
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:58,299
Europe I think they they handle RFID

839
00:42:49,630 --> 00:43:03,059
tags for to put in on it some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

840
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:03,059
places I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

841
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:12,099
what else and of course the idea also

842
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:15,038
for the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to have some sort of</font>

843
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:19,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth integration as well so maybe</font>

844
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:22,119
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth as some sort of tracking</font>

845
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:28,419
also for devices that of course support

846
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:29,859
bluetooth it's nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a marketing</font>

847
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:34,658
department didn't make this beautiful

848
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:39,328
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't have to worry about</font>

849
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:43,150
that anyways here's an example on how to

850
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:46,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">use this technology to track luggage on</font>

851
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:49,300
on airport

852
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:51,190
it's funny nowadays that airports

853
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,740
because of security they're mostly

854
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,570
concerned on not losing luggage because

855
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,430
of security because they really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

856
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,800
know who that<font color="#E5E5E5"> belongs to you and where</font>

857
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:03,310
it's going where it is and stuff like

858
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as of before I don't think it</font>

859
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,810
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really that way but the interesting</font>

860
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing about this slide and that's why I</font>

861
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:15,250
put it here is it mixes two types of

862
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:19,000
technologies one is the Wi-Fi one of

863
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:20,680
course using the RSSI to calculate

864
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,280
distance and all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

865
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,470
other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> excuse tdoa which stands for</font>

866
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,310
time difference of arrival so they're

867
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:33,609
two totally different systems and mixing

868
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:37,180
both of them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is probably some</font>

869
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:40,450
where you must say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah this it</font>

870
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:43,690
probably costs a lot to mix both and of

871
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:46,600
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> one just using one of them could</font>

872
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:51,490
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough but for example exercise</font>

873
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:53,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> subset is acceptable to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outdoor not</font>

874
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:56,129
outdoor interference but changes in the

875
00:44:53,890 --> 00:45:03,759
environment could really affect our SSI

876
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:06,550
and but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say so well that's the</font>

877
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,390
idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to luggage real time on</font>

878
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:12,910
an airport so if the guy wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

879
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:18,100
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> his getting a connection and running</font>

880
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:20,200
from one one terminal to another if his

881
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:23,110
luggage is going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not so he</font>

882
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:28,000
can start complaining about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> before he</font>

883
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:31,810
can see his destination so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

884
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:38,230
lots of rfid applications out there and

885
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:40,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just listed whatever i remember but</font>

888
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:50,339
Germany and a no can correct me if i'm

889
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:53,640
wrong i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if you have a dog the dog</font>

890
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:56,700
is you have to tag the dog so if it gets

891
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,890
lost and stuff like that it can be not

892
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,049
not only be found know who it belongs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

893
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:06,299
but no other information about the dog

894
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:12,390

00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:14,040
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also old luggage tracking not</font>

896
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,770
only a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate the luggage tracking</font>

897
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,470
thing there's not not a Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID tag</font>

898
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:21,839
thing is not a new link some airports

899
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:25,759
they have already the old tag but it's

900
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a real time tracking of the thing</font>

901
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:34,140
passports<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is supposed</font>

00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:36,780
to use best<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fighting own passports</font>

903
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,930
this year or the following<font color="#E5E5E5"> year last</font>

904
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:42,180
year netherlands i think they started

905
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:46,259
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but then security problems</font>

906
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:50,578
were raised and i think they they

907
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:53,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">cancelled it not sure customer loyalty</font>

908
00:46:50,579 --> 00:47:00,089
cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> so collection everybody knows</font>

909
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:04,589
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it exxon speed pass to buy gas and</font>

910
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:07,319
that's it libraries and then when we you

911
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:09,540
list all this and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said they're</font>

912
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:12,470
probably weigh much more than this I

913
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:14,880
just couldn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anything else</font>

914
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:16,859
just looking at a few of these you of

915
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">course you start thinking about security</font>

916
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:21,440
and privacy mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security so</font>

917
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:29,280
some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be really broken if</font>

918
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:31,589
the system doesn't work new<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfid</font>

919
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:36,300
applications some new stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw</font>

920
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:38,578
to me out this<font color="#CCCCCC"> em mp3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> player that has</font>

921
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,610
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of smart card arrived rfid on</font>

922
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:43,320
that

923
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:45,660
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in Asia so that means</font>

924
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,150
you can use a lot of public

925
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,440
transportation you the guy mp3 player

926
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,810
you're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the subway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

927
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,330
just pass your mp3 player through the

928
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:57,330
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's it you're paid for the</font>

929
00:47:54,330 --> 00:48:00,410
for the subway clothing there are some

930
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:02,580
brands that have a lot of RFID already

931
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:05,970
vending machines instead of putting

932
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:09,569
coins or some sort of card you use some

933
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:11,910
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID card or even your cell</font>

934
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:17,540
phone so cell phones now<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they have</font>

935
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:20,310
RFID as well so you put deduct from your

936
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,560
whatever you charge to that car or later

937
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:25,470
know if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is it it's</font>

938
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:29,400
synchronized with your cell phone bill

939
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:30,830
somehow and casino chips but few months

940
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,530
ago a lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were talking about</font>

941
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:36,390
casinos pudding RFID on the chips not

942
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:38,190
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know where the money goes or</font>

943
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:42,210
what's happening what games are being

944
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:46,070
played but also to possibly track some

945
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:46,070
sort of frog and stuff like that

946
00:48:46,760 --> 00:49:02,940
probably i think it is fairly new<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

947
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:04,650
heard there's about probably six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

948
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,870
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I bet they were gonna be</font>

949
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:09,240
implementing but most likely but for the

950
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,710
price he was saying that probably this

951
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">is for the high denomination ships</font>

952
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it doesn't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to put</font>

953
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:20,759
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cheap ones and in the future I</font>

954
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,340
don't know landing the future but home

955
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,910
appliances would probably have some sort

956
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:32,200
of rfid reader on it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you put</font>

957
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:34,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">your white t-shirt that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bought</font>

958
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,160
with the red t-shirt on the washer the

959
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:38,380
washer is going to tell you not to turn

960
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,828
it on because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it could be not a</font>

961
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:43,839
good thing same thing with ovens you go

962
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:46,480
you buy you go to the store you buy one

963
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:49,540
of those delicious I don't know how's it

964
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">called healthy something and you put</font>

965
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,470
there and knows how long you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

966
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say two minutes and 35 seconds it</font>

967
00:49:53,470 --> 00:50:00,189
knows for how long it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cook</font>

968
00:49:54,970 --> 00:50:02,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing money so they many countries</font>

969
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:06,640
are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about putting RFID on money</font>

970
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:11,140
smart paper that is actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> co ideas</font>

971
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:13,000
so for books and business cards so the

972
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,700
libraries<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to implement RFID</font>

973
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,700
the RFID is going to come already on the

974
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:21,310
boot and that facilitates for the stores

975
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:24,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">and for libraries and all the tracking</font>

976
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:27,670
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about sports this</font>

977
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:29,589
I heard a few days ago that because of

978
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:32,560
the last Super Bowl the<font color="#E5E5E5"> controversy is</font>

979
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:34,180
that they're gonna somehow and I of

980
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:40,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">course they didn't give the details but</font>

981
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:43,660
they want to use RFID to make sure they

982
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:48,490
didn't do the wrong calls or we fix the

983
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,810
wrong calls it's possible and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

984
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:54,640
sure people are going to get creative

985
00:50:49,810 --> 00:51:00,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do more stuff with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that couldn't</font>

986
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:03,069
think of anything else so talking a

987
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:05,939
little bit about security and this is

988
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:13,020
for rfid in general not any specific

989
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:15,069
type encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is encryption and</font>

990
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:18,790
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit in</font>

991
00:51:15,069 --> 00:51:20,310
another slide but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is mostly two</font>

992
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,720
types of encryption that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be used</font>

993
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:25,359
but they're simple encryption why

994
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,970
because the tag is a tiny thing and

995
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,538
there's overhead you cannot talking

996
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:33,788
about the passive tanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

997
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:35,559
there's there's nowhere to put

998
00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:38,229
information there there's no waiting or

999
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:41,709
it's hard to implement cryptography on

1000
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:48,848
that so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way it does let's talk about</font>

1001
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:51,279
that now the way does it it is with some

1002
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:52,989
sort of hash lock access control and

1003
00:51:51,279 --> 00:51:54,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are like two times one that is</font>

1004
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:56,979
randomized and the other one is not

1005
00:51:54,729 --> 00:52:00,519
randomized so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1006
00:51:56,979 --> 00:52:02,919
one-way function so the reader I think

1007
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:04,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">Phi's itself to the bag and the bag only</font>

1008
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,289
sends information to the reader that

1009
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:10,390
it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send information but</font>

1010
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">again this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a simple thing but it's</font>

1011
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:19,709
better they're not then nothing just

1012
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:21,670
like web other problems that user data

1013
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:25,598
depending on the type of the bag could

1014
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:28,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">be modified</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning if it's a read and</font>

1015
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,390
write tag and you could somebody could

1016
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:33,729
change the user information on that tank

1017
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:36,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">this could be fun too because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

1018
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:39,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">change I don't know if you had some sort</font>

1019
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:41,140
of tool that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that on the</font>

1020
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:45,219
fly you could go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a store look at one</font>

1021
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:47,259
DVD that caused 999 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a brand new</font>

1022
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:49,900
one and so you swap the identity of the

1023
00:52:47,259 --> 00:52:51,789
packs you swap the products based on the

1024
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:56,799
information that is on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag and you</font>

1025
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:59,769
pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever it's on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tank no</font>

1026
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:03,519
read protection that's kind of how it

1027
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:05,319
was it was like that until it<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends</font>

1028
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:08,049
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's implemented let's put like this</font>

1029
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:12,489
because if he has<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of hash</font>

1030
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:13,869
function then the reader has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tag is</font>

1031
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:17,019
only going to send information to that

1032
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:19,930
reader but usually attack cannot not

1033
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:23,618
awake so when it's close to a reader to

1034
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:26,219
a transceiver it's gonna wake and try to

1035
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:26,219
send information

1036
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:32,750
and also no scanning protection it's the

1037
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:35,210
same idea so then when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to scan is</font>

1038
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:43,990
the reader getting close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the</font>

1039
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tag about privacy you have</font>

1040
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:49,819
eavesdropping as I mentioned in the

1041
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:52,579
beginning could be a little of a problem

1042
00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:54,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially if you can awake tags from</font>

1043
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:58,490
far away and also read the information

1044
00:53:54,470 --> 00:54:00,439
from those tags and not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

1045
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:04,189
customers but also for some businesses

1046
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:07,940
so if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanna know what your</font>

1047
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:09,470
competitors are selling or how their

1048
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,319
their inventory are doing how are

1049
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:13,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're selling that type of brand</font>

1050
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:15,680
there's any more than you and stuff like

1051
00:54:13,609 --> 00:54:22,460
that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

1052
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:24,680
based on that it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> they already</font>

1053
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:28,970
do a great job<font color="#E5E5E5"> with customer profiling</font>

1054
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:32,058
so as I said before they know most

1055
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:34,640
people the modest let's put like this

1056
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:37,160
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer loyalty cards and</font>

1057
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,839
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1058
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:43,339
these people buy and they get targeted

1059
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:48,220
ads and all that stuff from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1060
00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:48,220
be maybe a better way of improving that

1061
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:57,109
same thing with to identify a person and

1062
00:54:54,859 --> 00:55:00,549
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be a problem I don't know</font>

1063
00:54:57,109 --> 00:55:02,839
when they implement in all passports and

1064
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:04,549
they could know where you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> from and</font>

1065
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:06,099
stuff like that based on the information

1066
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:09,140
that you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know that you're</font>

1067
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:14,950
you're sending out so this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1068
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:14,950
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to maybe think about</font>

1069
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:23,600
another thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hot listing of</font>

1070
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:25,549
to know kind of who you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so if</font>

1071
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,339
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get if you got it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your backpack a</font>

1072
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:30,890
few boots about network security and

1073
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:32,900
stuff like that and you go to interrupt

1074
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:34,609
in a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks and you're walking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

1075
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,610
and some guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna say oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy who</font>

1076
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:40,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows she likes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about encryption</font>

1077
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:42,230
there's this and that and they could

1078
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:45,110
come to you and say hey you want to hear

1079
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:51,470
miss my story know what we do and stuff

1080
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:56,330
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so another possible thing same</font>

1081
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:59,089
thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other topic and the old</font>

1082
00:55:56,330 --> 00:56:01,100
dumpster dive could be could get an

1083
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:05,110
upgrade nowadays with an RFID reader

1084
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:10,160
when all the products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you buy have</font>

1085
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:13,640
have some sort of RFID on it and the

1086
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,040
tags are still active or alive with

1087
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,509
useful information people could know

1088
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:22,820
what your while<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're buying and</font>

1089
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:27,490
throwing away so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possible</font>

1090
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:30,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">solutions for these for some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

1091
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:32,330
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about killing the tag</font>

1092
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:35,990
once he leaves the store meaning after

1093
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:38,720
you paid it removes all the information

1094
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:41,209
about that product so if somebody tries

1095
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:46,879
to read that bag it doesn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

1096
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:48,890
useful at all RSA has a project of

1097
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,190
creating a block attack what is a

1098
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:54,980
blocker tag you walk with that link and

1099
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:56,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty much doses all the reader</font>

1100
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,910
some when you walk close to a reader and

1101
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:01,759
you have a bag<font color="#CCCCCC"> full of stuff that has</font>

1102
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:04,580
RFID and you're also carrying that RSA

1103
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:08,359
killer tag it's going to just generate

1104
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:10,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to generate random numbers and</font>

1105
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:15,680
send to the to the to the reader so the

1106
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:17,930
reader is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get confused law can</font>

1107
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:23,899
use it memory on the tag is another

1108
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:27,350
possibility but on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> readwrite tags if</font>

1109
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:32,140
you again if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the right to 22</font>

1110
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:34,880
read that and do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's useless and</font>

1111
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:40,100
again talked about encryption and

1112
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,990
overhead of encryption on rfid tags so

1113
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,730
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is used today is the hash mark</font>

1114
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:46,790
access control and randomized<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hash</font>

1115
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:49,010
mark access control encryption I think

1116
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:50,720
there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ideas to put some</font>

1117
00:57:49,010 --> 00:58:01,190
sort of encryption on it but I

1118
00:57:50,720 --> 00:58:04,250
personally doubt it attacks on on based

1119
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:06,560
on the RFID technology all rights dump

1120
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:08,990
it's been out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for a few years</font>

1121
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:11,090
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a presentation on black hat</font>

1122
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:13,669
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> daft on two years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago anything</font>

1123
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:16,250
really detailed really good one go to

1124
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:19,040
the internet and look for it totally

1125
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:22,430
worth seeing the material and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two is</font>

1126
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:24,140
out there tied swapping that's what I'm

1127
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:27,980
saying when you go to a store<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

1128
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:30,560
have RS dump on your PDA you have some

1129
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,790
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reader writer you can change the</font>

1130
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:37,009
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the flight from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1131
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:39,140
product to another same thing with

1132
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:42,680
converting products epc's will be

1133
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:44,540
changing information on the tag and RFID

1134
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,940
bombs should be changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID</font>

1135
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,529
minds that's another thing right so if

1136
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,390
you have information too much

1137
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:53,150
information on a tank that can identify

1138
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:56,420
you from being from one place or another

1139
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:58,550
one country or another and I don't know

1140
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:00,940
they could create<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of mind that</font>

1141
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">when these type of people they walk by</font>

1142
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:06,620
the thing can can explode and stuff like

1143
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:09,170
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be really dangerous if</font>

1144
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:11,450
you don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's</font>

1145
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,860
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about security in all</font>

1146
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:17,169
technologies but this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1147
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:17,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing so fast this could be worse</font>

1148
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:38,569
yeah yeah not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the she was talking</font>

1149
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:41,029
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US passports and in Iraq and</font>

1150
00:59:38,569 --> 00:59:43,819
stuff like that not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people but</font>

1151
00:59:41,029 --> 00:59:45,950
also most of the stuff that not most but

1152
00:59:43,819 --> 00:59:48,529
I bet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the military has lots of</font>

1153
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:53,058
stuff that is being RFID tracked so it's

1154
00:59:48,529 --> 00:59:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">not only people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but also a par the plane</font>

1155
00:59:53,059 --> 01:00:00,440
or anything like that now what are the

1156
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:04,129
security concerns for white why fight

1157
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:07,220
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wi-Fi bags well it is pretty</font>

1158
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:10,220
much the same problems that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on</font>

1159
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:14,660
Wi-Fi with a few new<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices in the</font>

1160
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:17,450
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so just like we can also</font>

1161
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:19,538
have a rogue radius server for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1162
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:22,970
identification thing for any sort of

1163
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:25,789
Wi-Fi network you could start have

1164
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:28,189
thinking about having a rope real-time

1165
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:31,670
location server and then have the tag

1166
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:35,480
sending somehow and this doesn't exist

1167
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:37,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just some thoughts that I have is</font>

1168
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:42,170
to send information from the tags to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1169
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:44,629
wrong server and that rogue server can

1170
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:49,099
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information for whatever</font>

1171
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:51,890
purpose it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it is therefore also spoof</font>

1172
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:54,230
tags so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Wi-Fi system</font>

1173
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:56,629
that protects from spoofing which most

1174
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:59,599
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> defenders out there too they have</font>

1175
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:01,670
some sort of protection to it but it's

1176
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,769
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to spoof a mac address you</font>

1177
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:06,589
can spoof the mac address over Wi-Fi tag

1178
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:09,200
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your laptop and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have and be running</font>

1179
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:12,170
some sort of client that does exactly

1180
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:17,868
what I Wi-Fi tag does and have drama

1181
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:19,309
problems or that packet injection once

1182
01:01:17,869 --> 01:01:21,580
he is nesting and you saw the

1183
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:24,100
information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sent</font>

1184
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:27,370
you could be generating similar traffic

1185
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:32,950
and sending all kinds of packets to them

1186
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:35,140
to the party<font color="#CCCCCC"> isle a server and my</font>

1187
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:40,120
creativity<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start there so think</font>

1188
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:44,109
about the rest resources about RFID you

1189
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:46,390
have the tool there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them some</font>

1190
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:49,930
other ones you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find lots of</font>

1191
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:53,680
political privacy stuff in most of them

1192
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:56,049
because people suddenly with RFID and

1193
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,850
this is not new at all like this has

1194
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,820
been going for a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years people are</font>

1195
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:03,160
really worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy but just</font>

1196
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:12,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of rfid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know why they</font>

1197
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:16,649
were not before absolutely and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1198
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:22,890
by the way so any questions at all

1199
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:27,400
normal time is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a longer break</font>

1200
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:29,890
whenever last finally they had around it

1201
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:32,460
is racing on my honor and if they make

1202
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:32,460
any cell phones

1203
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:42,680
the whole technology technology I have

1204
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:45,050
no idea cell phone work doesn't work on

1205
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:47,629
the scene no cell phones they could they

1206
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:50,570
could work here they would be 800

1207
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:56,300
megahertz eighteen hundred and nineteen

1208
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:57,859
hundred right yes we it's going to

1209
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:02,359
depend but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think here in the US is</font>

1210
01:02:57,859 --> 01:03:05,740
what 19 I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember now it</font>

1211
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:09,080
shouldn't well if it is you for this day

1212
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:12,109
she was 800 megahertz and the cell phone

1213
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:23,560
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tagus 900 megahertz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty</font>

1214
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:27,560
close and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also you could have any other</font>

1215
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:29,480
the older wireless phones they were 900

1216
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,580
megahertz I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the</font>

1217
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:35,000
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those things</font>

1218
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:37,130
that not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to avoid problems just</font>

1219
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,830
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't understand it to</font>

1220
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:41,540
just say same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with wife I'd like</font>

1221
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:43,340
but we don't don't want to implement

1222
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:45,230
Wi-Fi because it's dangerous but the

1223
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,359
hospital some hospitals are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

1224
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:49,510
with access points so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1225
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,509
case

1226
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:06,180
I don't know anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that how</font>

1227
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,180
would that work

1228
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:24,670
okay you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were saying that if you don't</font>

1229
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,650
know if you were like me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't know</font>

1230
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this the Trojan pretty much is</font>

1231
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:31,480
there's some sort of bad information or

1232
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:33,970
evil information on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID once the</font>

1233
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,280
reader gets that it gets propagated not

1234
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:38,649
only doesn't not only there's a buffer

1235
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:41,710
overflow on the the reader but also

1236
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:45,670
propagates to other two other tags that

1237
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:54,790
would be around or further read by that

1238
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:56,530
RFID something the way I what I wouldn't

1239
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,640
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the buffer overflow totally</font>

1240
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:09,160
I don't know what type of information

1241
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:12,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">could cause that but ok back to the</font>

1242
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">backend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1243
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah I think it's again totally</font>

1244
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:27,348
possible I just was so if it's a sequel

1245
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:29,180
injection to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend server it makes</font>

1246
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:31,849
more sense because the the reader is

1247
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:38,020
just a reader it wouldn't storing

1248
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:38,020
information there I think anybody else

1249
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:42,730
majority of the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very slowly</font>

1250
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:53,180
pls true that's that's the reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1251
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:56,299
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a possible problem would</font>

1252
01:05:53,180 --> 01:06:01,399
be have some sort of rogue<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTR TLS or</font>

1253
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:03,680
something like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course when</font>

1254
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:06,200
you also on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point if you're on the</font>

1255
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">second-generation Wi-Fi tags where</font>

1256
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,649
you're going to have the wireless system

1257
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:12,859
send information back to the archaeal a

1258
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:15,680
server and not the tag that connection

1259
01:06:12,859 --> 01:06:17,540
should be some salt some how secure as

1260
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:27,589
well from the access point all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

1261
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:29,710
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtls nobody else break time thank</font>

you

01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:53,120
alright so my name is Billy Hoffman some

1265
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:55,009
of you guys might know me as a siddhis

1266
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,960
I've spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a lot of conferences over</font>

1267
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:58,970
the past couple years on a wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> range of</font>

1268
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:01,430
topics today I'm here to talk to you

1269
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:04,250
about covert Carly which is basically a

1270
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:05,930
mechanism of how to use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> automated</font>

1271
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:07,790
process to crawl a website and gather

1272
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:10,910
information without leaving a forensics

1273
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:13,009
trail I tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a lot and really</font>

1274
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:15,020
fast so if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question please</font>

1275
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:17,359
feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interrupt me I have fun</font>

1276
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,549
schwag that I brought I've got some bag

1277
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:23,299
from when I spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> at shmoocon and some</font>

1278
01:08:19,549 --> 01:08:24,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">whoa that would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been bad some stuff</font>

1279
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,330
from black hat federal and stickers and

1280
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:28,220
stuff so if you have a good question you

1281
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:31,009
get schwag if you have a bad question<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1282
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:33,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">riddle quote ridicule you on that's kind</font>

1283
01:08:31,009 --> 01:08:37,880
of how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes all right you guys ready</font>

1284
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:39,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright cool so what am I going to talk</font>

1285
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">about we're going to go through and</font>

1286
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:43,100
first start talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is the</font>

1287
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:44,390
state of web application attacks we're

1288
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and talk about what</font>

1289
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:48,140
does a covert crawler pretty much kind

1290
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of changes the equations on how attack</font>

1291
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:52,040
and defense of web apps works we're

1292
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,149
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the opticals it took</font>

1293
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,528
to create the covert crawler

1294
01:08:53,149 --> 01:08:56,509
specifically how do you make an

1295
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:57,770
automated program act<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a browser how</font>

1296
01:08:56,509 --> 01:09:00,319
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make an automated program act</font>

1297
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:02,060
like a human and how you throttle one of

1298
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,319
these things we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

1299
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:05,720
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually implemented a covert</font>

1300
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:08,049
crawler and it says questions but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1301
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:10,880
said ask me questions the entire time

1302
01:09:08,049 --> 01:09:13,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so stay in the Union how many</font>

1303
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,589
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here have ever hacked a web app</font>

1304
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:17,240
how many has ever thrown like a single

1305
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:18,589
tick or something into a search field to

1306
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,210
see if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a sequel exception there</font>

1307
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:23,390
all sorts of fun stuff like that you

1308
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:25,399
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking websites is really easy you</font>

1309
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:26,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I'm sure a lot of you read bug</font>

1310
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:28,160
track like something like seventy

1311
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:29,990
percent of the bones I've been reading

1312
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,299
on bug tracker to last several months

1313
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:34,130
have all been web app attacks sequel

1314
01:09:32,299 --> 01:09:37,189
injection cross-site scripting misplaced

1315
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:39,529
trust you know improperly you know

1316
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:41,660
created SSL connections all sorts of

1317
01:09:39,529 --> 01:09:44,089
that nasty<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff they are laughably</font>

1318
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,950
common to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found a cross-site</font>

1319
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:47,600
scripting vulnerability in weather.com

1320
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:50,299
this morning when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font>

1321
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:52,609
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it it's crazy</font>

1322
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:53,990
they're all over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> place people are</font>

1323
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:56,030
hacking websites because it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1324
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:57,920
news there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this awesome attack on</font>

1325
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:59,389
myspace back in October somebody

1326
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,040
actually wrote a cross-site scripting

1327
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:06,630
virus which use Java code and

1328
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:09,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jax to propagate there's someone here</font>

1329
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:12,480
who is doing cross-site scripting stuff

1330
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:14,670
so this was an awesome virus that used

1331
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:17,309
ajax actually propagate itself and

1332
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:18,720
infect more cross-site or more of my

1333
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">space actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gave a presentation at</font>

black hat federal about web app worms

1335
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:24,450
and so if Aaron shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt come talk</font>

1336
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:26,270
to me afterwards people are hacking

1337
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:28,769
websites because they can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

1338
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:31,500
attacking a web app gives you the same

1339
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:33,450
payload and the same tank as you know

1340
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,490
doing say layer 3 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a layer for attack</font>

1341
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:37,050
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to you know gain access to</font>

1342
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:39,150
systems you normally don't have access

1343
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:40,890
to to grab passwords credit card data

1344

confidential information you know

identity theft anything you want to do

1346
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:45,240
you get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the information</font>

1347
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:46,950
through a web app just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as easily as you</font>

1348
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:50,690
can get access through you know a

01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:52,559
anonymous<font color="#E5E5E5"> account on ftp so</font>

1350
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:54,509
administrators are patching some of the

1351
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,340
holes pretty much the PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever the</font>

1352
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:59,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">hell exploit of the week because</font>

1353
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:01,230
seriously I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love open source i use</font>

1354
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:03,030
open source but god bless<font color="#CCCCCC"> sourceforge</font>

1355
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:04,889
and all these PHP projects because they

1356
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:08,370
completely keep my company in business

1357
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:09,420
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know but that's why I come and I</font>

1358
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:12,930
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you guys about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to actually</font>

1359
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">write secured web applications so it's a</font>

1360
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:16,830
given to take a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times people rely</font>

1361
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,990
on their logs if and when they get

1362
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:20,460
attacked they're like oh crap somebody

1363
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:22,500
you know totally just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dumped my entire</font>

1364
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,530
sequel database out let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to my logs</font>

1365
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:27,930
and see who was connecting to me a lot

1366
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:29,460
normally they contact the IP owner which

1367
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,570
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost always an open proxy that</font>

1368
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:32,820
shouldn't have been open in the first

1369
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:35,490
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the two people go after</font>

1370
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:37,380
the attacker with limited success so

1371
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:40,290
whether you're actually sneaking a web

1372
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:42,000
app attack by an IDs or an IPS is

1373
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:43,710
debatable there's some pretty cool tax

1374
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,380
dan kaminsky actually had a really neat

1375
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:49,320
timing attack with IP fragments so that

1376
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:52,050
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs would see a regular you know HTTP</font>

1377
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:54,059
GET you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> index.html and the web</font>

1378
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:56,250
server saw you know get sequel injection

1379
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,860
attack so you know they're there are

1380
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:01,020
ways around IDS's but the point I want

1381
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:02,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack here is that attacks</font>

1382
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:04,770
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't happen out of thin air people</font>

1383
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,509
recon sites ahead of time they try to

1384
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:08,190
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm I want to attack this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bank let</font>

1385
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:09,600
me start analyzing and let me start

1386
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,639
pounding on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank a little bit do</font>

1387
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,410
some reconnaissance and see if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1388
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually attack them and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

1389
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:16,800
forensic people will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it's</font>

1390
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,059
reconnaissance they're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in</font>

1391
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,590
the logs and that's how they're able to

1392
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">attract</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people because people will</font>

1393
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:23,850
almost always launch attacks through

1394
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:25,650
proxies compromised machines botnets you

1395
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:28,130
know open access points but almost

1396
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:28,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">always</font>
