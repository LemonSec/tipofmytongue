senators Kerry's office so we're just

43
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,030
researching you on the internet and it

44
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:35,579
says here that you're a hacker that

45
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:38,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">could be a problem wait a minute okay</font>

46
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,089
refresh your screen see I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hacker</font>

47
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,500
that's not a problem so I happens a lot

48
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,430
of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget I'm misunderstood and we</font>

49
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,079
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what it was like in</font>

50
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the early days back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the 1970s when I</font>

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,009
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started learning about computers</font>

52
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,479
working with systems that fundamentally

53
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,750
give us the same challenges we have

54
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,490
today but they operated at a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> slower</font>

55
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,840
speed and we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

56
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,039
communications who have the bandwidth it

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,250
words i was out there so this is before

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,850
the internet no internet available no

59
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:12,550
email sounds great right

60
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:14,049
no cell phones all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right no pcs no 802</font>

61
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,910
dot11 anything i think it was down

62
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,890
around 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 11 it says they're still</font>

63
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,020
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standards back then but</font>

64
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,790
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did have is an opportunity to</font>

65
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,840
work on the mainframes and so back in

66
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,239
high school I went to Amherst high

67
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,800
school<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of buffalo new york and</font>

68
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,000
buffalo is a great place we've got two

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,240
seasons their winter in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fourth of</font>

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">july so if you if you miss it you come</font>

71
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,560
back the next year you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can catch the Sun</font>

72
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,239
but stuff where your got in there they

73
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">had these two computers terminals in</font>

74
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,720
there there are IBM 2740<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones anybody</font>

75
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,810
ever heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that term or know what</font>

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,359
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is yeah the Giants electric</font>

77
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,540
typewriter parked on a box of about 50

78
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,870
pounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of electronic gear and what it</font>

79
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,519
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we have in a phone with a gusta</font>

80
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,310
coupler you dial the number push the

81
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,080
button put the phone in there and you

82
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,420
got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 connection to the mainframe</font>

83
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,910
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> rockin well the problem is</font>

84
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,100
these things came without any directions

85
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,829
there were no classes there are no

86
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,190
courses they're very just there you are

87
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,690
go figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out well isn't that really</font>

88
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,660
what we're all about trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font>

89
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,910
things out<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge of academic pursuit</font>

90
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,709
of knowledge finding things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font>

91
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,109
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what how they work so it wasn't</font>

92
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,930
too bad except for the fact that anybody

93
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,900
ever heard of APL a programming language

94
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,610
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know about APL that's all</font>

95
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,530
you know he knows it it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a</font>

96
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,140
plz totally symbolic programming

97
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,230
languages actually developed as a

98
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,940
mathematical notation back in the 1960s

99
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,760
by guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the name of dr. Kent Iverson</font>

100
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,800
IBM and so you know back down we loved

101
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,109
APL and we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was pretty neat</font>

102
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,280
but it was a right only<font color="#E5E5E5"> language because</font>

103
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,230
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> she wrote code you could never</font>

104
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what you wrote because the</font>

105
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,280
whole upper case were not letters<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

106
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,170
were symbols and so what you did is you

107
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,340
tried to pack as much things you can to

108
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,320
online this is an interpreted language

109
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,989
and you could do amazing thing they did

110
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,269
conway's game a life in one line ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

111
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,830
was 254 characters but you could squeeze

112
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff in there and yet other</font>

113
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,750
cool things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but the hard part</font>

114
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,570
was is of course how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

115
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,310
make this thing work to do stuff beyond

116
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,630
just the basic economics<font color="#E5E5E5"> you couldn't do</font>

117
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,108
is it for school you could use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

118
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,108
prey

119
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:34,710
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> edit this out right yeah this is</font>

120
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,500
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real advice ever do the milli vanilli</font>

121
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:42,520
I've we got with my head not working up

122
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,290
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuckin hair anyway so all right we</font>

123
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">need some more drawings more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people come</font>

124
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:50,320
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll get in cars as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

125
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:54,640
the door all right who's got number 0 0

126
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:59,170
to 0 who is here early yeah over there

127
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:07,599
you were here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee you like shirts are</font>

128
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:09,340
you not the Fed there you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,080
give it a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of computers where you</font>

130
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,219
got things hooked up and you're trying

131
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out how does this make all</font>

132
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,970
this thing work together we start

133
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,260
exploring it we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

134
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,300
the systems after a while we write

135
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,800
programs you write it in for a tap<font color="#CCCCCC"> lakay</font>

136
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,750
shins but of course who wants to just

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,250
stop there it's a closed system there's

138
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,990
not a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of damage you can do but</font>

139
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,040
we were exploring around trying to

140
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,170
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

141
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,250
turned out that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are certain</font>

142
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,150
functions that were in there they

143
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned all these little shift</font>

144
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,530
characters you could do one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that</font>

145
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,000
was called I beams and when I beam was

146
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you had one character and you back</font>

147
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,790
spaced over you create another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

148
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,030
then you could get system information

149
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:45,520
guy being 29 which user ID pretty cool

150
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,599
or you could also get another i-beam we

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,770
should tell you the total minutes of

152
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect timer actually like hundreds of</font>

153
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,090
a second and the total cpu processing

154
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,409
time and things like that well one day

155
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,109
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys came in they said hey I</font>

156
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:00,040
found a journal that had an iba PL

157
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,210
program in it and it had a dyadic iving

158
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,650
like something on the left something on

159
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,840
the right it's like well what the heck

160
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that well we never seen those before</font>

161
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,169
we went ahead we try typing in and sure

162
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,690
enough those are system control

163
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,580
functions<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can now change the your</font>

164
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,469
origin you could change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your random</font>

165
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,570
number seed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start changing stuff</font>

166
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,460
we thought plus is pretty cool wonder

167
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,750
what else you can change so we start

168
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,039
trying all the permutations and we kind

169
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,510
of bump into the walls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you</font>

170
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,870
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out this just so far you can get</font>

171
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:29,020
as a user well in an APL environment you

172
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,240
got 32 k a memory and that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to store</font>

173
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,710
your program and to execute your program

174
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,300
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed like a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

175
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,409
we'd store all kinds of stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put</font>

176
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything in there we cram it in there</font>

177
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,610
we thought like Bill Gates 640k who's

178
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,800
ever going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat anymore that was what</font>

179
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,840
32k was a standard back in the 1970s we

180
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,099
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was great but there's one</font>

181
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we always wanted to do and of</font>

182
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:49,360
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody wants to do is that's</font>

183
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,729
become<font color="#CCCCCC"> rude well how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become root</font>

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,620
in a system<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that turns out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

185
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system operator because</font>

186
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">every day we login there's an operator</font>

187
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,659
there any little broadcast message and

188
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,460
we'd be trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to socially engineer the</font>

189
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,050
operator but this guy it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully</font>

190
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,330
attended terminal occasionally do stuff

191
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,500
but wasn't too bad but there was the one

192
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,940
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we had you couldn't go in</font>

193
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,210
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't go ahead and build a</font>

194
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,940
rootkit<font color="#E5E5E5"> you couldn't develop tools but</font>

195
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,359
in high<font color="#CCCCCC"> school you have what field trips</font>

196
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,069
and we had a field<font color="#CCCCCC"> trip all the way out</font>

197
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,509
to where the computing center was whale

198
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,970
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the airport we thought all this is</font>

199
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,199
pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a couple of us who kind</font>

200
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">of figure it out that hey this would be</font>

201
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,470
neat to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a system operator and we came</font>

202
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">along to field trip you're kind of</font>

203
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,930
walking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the the tapes</font>

204
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,880
and the drum memory and and the IBM 370

205
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok we're doing pretty well 360 was the</font>

206
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,130
original but the 370 at least this with

207
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,240
the table huge phenomenon of<font color="#E5E5E5"> air</font>

208
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">conditioned coming through there in a</font>

209
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,020
bit the way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did authentication is</font>

210
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,159
what yet have a white lab coat with four

211
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,479
different colored pens again then out of

212
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> door and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you control the</font>

213
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,330
data flow if you didn't wear one of

214
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,949
those and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were obviously a visitor</font>

215
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,030
and then you were watched so we got in

216
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,870
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're looking around and we're</font>

217
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,690
looking all this stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

218
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,099
there's the console<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well these old</font>

219
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,840
consoles did what they print out an<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

220
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,969
fan fold paper come come come come come

221
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,729
kiss paul down there so we wanted to do

222
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:06,340
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> say okay you distract the tour guides</font>

223
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:08,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll come over here well kind of</font>

224
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,169
look through the fan fold and find it

225
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,000
and like there it is found the system

226
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,310
operator ID and<font color="#CCCCCC"> passed all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas</font>

227
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,229
were numeric and so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking it's</font>

228
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:23,139
like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying remembers like it's six</font>

229
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:25,419
digit number<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 3 14 15 93 14 15 93</font>

230
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:29,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">one for 159 starting to sound familiar</font>

231
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:31,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rude ID and the APL systems was pie</font>

232
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,640
but also had the password there because

233
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,740
it wasn't math it's like okay we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

234
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,939
so now the adrenaline is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone right you</font>

235
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,130
have a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you got to finish the</font>

236
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,750
field trip to get back in line look at

237
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,039
this pretend to be fascinated pretend to

238
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,290
be interested so we get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to school</font>

239
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,040
the first thing we do okay everybody's

240
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,189
gone

241
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,459
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> 31 for 159 enter the password</font>

242
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,860
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> in use because you can have only</font>

243
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:55,989
one operator at a time all right let's

244
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,550
reasonable policy I suppose so now we

245
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,860
created what kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem that we</font>

246
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,899
have in the morning something you deal

247
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,569
with today we need when you're looking

248
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it building code race condition right</font>

249
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:08,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and you have to</font>

250
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:09,880
log in<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the operator does problem</font>

251
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,620
isn't a start up the Machine usually by

252
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,360
the time you got into school pro its

253
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,509
systems up and running but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning</font>

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,120
we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> in early alright that was good so</font>

255
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:22,120
he logged in 314 159 ended in the

256
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">password and it took it's like okay</font>

257
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,740
we've got it we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's only</font>

258
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,540
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when your system operator</font>

259
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,699
console that console is expected to

260
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,949
receive messages all day long it's not

261
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:35,258
for interaction so the keyboard stays

262
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:36,609
locked until you hit like an escape here

263
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:38,529
at a tension key which then frees up the

264
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,940
cursor so we're sitting there we're

265
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,920
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like doing anything</font>

266
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,899
we're going we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing anything of</font>

267
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,180
course meanwhile system operator gets

268
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:47,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">number in use boots us off the system</font>

269
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,670
changes the past or an hour back around

270
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:53,680
zero again so lather rinse repeat

271
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:58,079
another field trip another opportunity

272
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,760
and we get a second shot at it this time

273
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,489
you figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we need a better</font>

274
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,139
strategy how are going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this well</font>

275
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,399
okay we understand how the system

276
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,350
commands work they're all privileged

277
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've got to be based on something so</font>

278
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,560
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my buddies who is a year all of</font>

279
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,930
you as a junior ray clark wray was any

280
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,160
guy and Ray said he'd do anything it's a

281
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,069
nice guy so he said hey I'll go down to

282
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,750
IBM downtown Buffalo and because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

283
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:22,449
at the APL manual because we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

284
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,130
catalog of all the books and by the way

285
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:26,019
if you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> little cards here if</font>

286
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,670
you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this job deck is if</font>

287
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:30,339
you start comparing them it's the

288
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">catalog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of publications this is from</font>

290
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:38,769
that I stuck up there in 1974 if you

291
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,259
smell the cards go ahead smell<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

292
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:42,759
that's mom's attic I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick these</font>

293
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:45,670
things up three days ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

294
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,240
Buffalo IBM system/360 disk operating

processing and data collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

298
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:56,290
there's all kinds of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

299
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,920
there of course this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all this is it</font>

300
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,060
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i call a dead deck</font>

301
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,380
but it was still potentially useful so

302
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,630
anyway we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this catalog of IBM</font>

303
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,029
manuals and one of them was licensed

304
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,529
materials like the system operator

305
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,240
manual for<font color="#E5E5E5"> APL like we got to get that</font>

306
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one probably call it by</font>

307
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,290
Beyonce deodorant so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can order is</font>

308
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,660
why not what's a licensed publication

309
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,920
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only be checked out like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a like</font>

310
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,819
the reference section of a library but

311
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,130
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really allowed to have it</font>

312
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,800
unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> already own IBM 370 do you</font>

313
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,560
have what um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how much you</font>

314
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,229
got not we can't afford to buy one so

315
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,869
anyway ray racist don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

316
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,279
go down see this is bicycle rides down

317
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Buffalo goes up and bangs on the door</font>

318
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,240
IBM and<font color="#E5E5E5"> says I need a copy of this</font>

319
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,380
manual at the IBM reference manual says

320
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,449
we're not allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give it to you says</font>

321
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,769
I want one we're not allowed to I said I

322
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,349
need to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to somebody so let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

323
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,149
to Ken Iverson remember dr. IRA said

324
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,680
Leah he's on our month New York and this

325
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:51,079
guy's enshrined like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these great</font>

326
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,149
gurus so there he keeps pushing until

327
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:55,040
they call over to our marketing get old

328
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:57,440
dr. Iverson he's into some big staff

329
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,000
meeting and ago what is it he said

330
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,829
there's some kid here wants to copy the

331
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,829
manual I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it a manual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> click</font>

332
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,370
so ray comes back with the Holy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grail</font>

333
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,769
and we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

334
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,139
we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fine here ok you can</font>

335
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:15,670
privileged accounts you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> add accounts</font>

336
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,230
you can add<font color="#E5E5E5"> workspaces you can change it</font>

337
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,689
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like you might</font>

338
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,730
expect of course the hard part is you

339
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:24,040
can't run the privileged commands and

340
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,990
lecture the operator and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only way to</font>

341
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,930
get to be the operator is to get in but

342
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you could privilege somebody else</font>

343
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe and we have two terminals you</font>

344
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,079
could blog the one as an operator you

345
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">login to you I'll quick privilege you</font>

346
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:40,628
then log back out as an operator and now

347
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:42,670
we've got a privileged machine that

348
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:45,670
works if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the race condition</font>

349
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:48,279
that you satisfied and then you're also

350
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,769
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and what shift your</font>

351
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,449
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> part so now unless they happen to</font>

352
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,120
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a special command that shows who the</font>

353
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:56,529
system users we're in the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

354
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,300
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trust that to anybody else in</font>

355
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:00,100
high school someone's got root on the

356
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,349
sister Becca delete start out starter

357
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,139
everything's gone so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you gonna</font>

358
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,449
do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you gotta like I gotta go to</font>

359
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:08,709
social studies class but I don't want to

360
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:11,829
go to so Jay I want to come on the

361
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:13,930
system but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna log</font>

362
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:15,638
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we'll try again of course it's</font>

363
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,739
just so difficult to get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then</font>

364
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,240
we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else we</font>

365
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,709
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> said hey we heard about the</font>

366
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,180
static I have anything to control system

367
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:23,920
functions guess what also control all

368
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,138
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> privilege functions as well right</font>

369
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty cool here's one that</font>

370
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:32,500
creates a privileged user so what do you

371
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,810
do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't run it only the</font>

372
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,160
operator can but you can't get in as the

373
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:42,489
operator because he's already logged in

374
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:44,500
so what do you create come on not a

375
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,660
virus couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> viruses back then but you</font>

376
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,589
could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan horses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're right</font>

377
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,660
something said hey we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really</font>

378
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,059
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> tic-tac-toe game remember this is</font>

379
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">all text plugin and we kept trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

380
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:55,149
with the operator play our game play

381
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,230
this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we lock up the code so</font>

382
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,379
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

383
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,519
and done we worked on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so anyway</font>

384
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,439
we kept working on these little<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

385
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,009
and you started exploring the boundaries

386
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:07,449
well back then you figured okay yeah 32k

387
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:08,649
workspace you're logging in with all the

388
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:09,699
other high schools you send messages

389
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,889
back and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the equivalent</font>

390
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:14,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">texting somebody now but it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all on a</font>

391
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,769
system had to be in the console but of

392
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:19,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">course you</font>

393
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:21,170
more you always want more right so we

394
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:23,899
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what else is there out</font>

395
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,459
there well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out that there is a</font>

396
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple times share systems that were</font>

397
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">also available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the state of New York</font>

398
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,429
and they were because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw those at</font>

399
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:32,569
different exhibitions and things like

400
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,949
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to get a chance to</font>

401
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:36,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we heard about this one in</font>

Binghamton or poughkeepsie new york or

403

414
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:10,519
what the problem was how to get the

420
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:21,199
we dialed five and it gave you the tone

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you dial one or two other numbers</font>

423
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,899
got this weird dial tone<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm it's not</font>

anything you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried dial home or whatever</font>

00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:35,509
click out well what do you do when you

427
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,499
encounter a new access<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and you're</font>

mapping these things all out we had a

whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we just seem to work and</font>

446
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,510
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would then allow</font>

447

you to dial<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 from there and then get an</font>

thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well the back</font>

456
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:48,520
then people said well y'all<font color="#E5E5E5"> always go</font>

457
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,640
aren't you breaking the law well there

458
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,740
were no laws really there weren't the

459

any damage don't take anything that

doesn't belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very very</font>

463
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">different than what we see today in</font>

464
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,790
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of behavior but we're very sincere</font>

465
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,379
about that and this one system which is

<font color="#CCCCCC">psychosis upon Poughkeepsie New York</font>

467
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,980
because we had a chance to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

468
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,980
the summer when we did a exhibition of

469
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,440
the erie county fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> had user IDs that</font>

470
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">were four digits and most of them edited</font>

471
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,520
and 0 0 or 0 1 so how tough is at the

472
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,660
brute force<font color="#E5E5E5"> but once you got in you</font>

473
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,040
found out the timeshare system would

474
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,020
build you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kinect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time at bill you</font>

475
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,020
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU time and that was probably</font>

476
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,400
somebody's real money well if you build

477
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,610
somebody else to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kinect time you're</font>

478
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,340
violating the prime directive right so

479
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:39,070
how do you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of that it turns out</font>

480
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,389
that they rebooted that system every

481
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,919
night I shut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down they ran their</font>

482
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,320
accounting at about six o'clock at night

483
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,580
and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the timeshare system they</font>

484
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,200
would issue a command to say okay

485
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,370
everybody log off and we're going to

486
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,130
bounce you off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system in five</font>

487
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,229
minutes and it turned out that is when

488
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,270
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> issued the bounce command you would</font>

489
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,820
get bounced off as soon as you got

490
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,590
control back at the console or if I can

491
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,780
program was running it would interrupt

492
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,220
the program and bounce you off and we

493
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:07,559
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it how do you extend</font>

494
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,580
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep on even though that</font>

495
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't work so we're trying different</font>

496
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,280
thing every night<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there okay</font>

497
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,179
let's try running this big complicated

498
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,428
line<font color="#E5E5E5"> one go to one and it kicks you</font>

499
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,600
right outside inorg you try typing in a

500
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,630
long message but while<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're typing it</font>

501
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,570
goes your bounced out but turned out if

502
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,620
you type a really long line it can't

503
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">find we always deal I said never</font>

504
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,959
interrupt you in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of line</font>

505
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,120
there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to the end of the</font>

506
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:36,990
line what's the longest line you can

507
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:38,459
output in a 32k system<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 2007 and 68 k</font>

508
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">ASCII characters or what if you're using</font>

509
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:46,799
binary 0 and 1 well they<font color="#CCCCCC"> only took one</font>

510
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:48,870
bit so now you get 260 2144 zeros or

511
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,020
ones and how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> does that take the</font>

512
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,399
print on the line long time well back

513
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,960
then they had the old type balls where

514
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,730
you had this little round thing with all

515
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,110
the keys you take the tight ball off so

516
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,460
you wouldn't waste all the paper because

517
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,199
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> running paper forward back up</font>

518
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,020
down left right because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were really</font>

519
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">resource-constrained them so you wait</font>

520
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,710
till the guy says it bouncing the system

521
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's about three minutes to six all</font>

522
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">right 200,000 zeros pick off the tight</font>

523
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:16,740
ball hit enter your and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going it's</font>

524
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,360
going you realize like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last boss</font>

525
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,230
site leaves at six o'clock from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,299
else's system except off for you and he

530
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:28,919
gives up and he just shuts<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the</font>

531
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,230
system at which point it just stops

532
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,730
powered off run out the door chase the

Blessed<font color="#CCCCCC"> towns right way to get home in</font>

534
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,750
time for a late dinner or any dinner at

535
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:38,490
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was six of us and so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

536
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,539
get home on time he probably neat but I

537
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:45,360
eat a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of peanut butter and jelly but</font>

538
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:48,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> court thing was it reset it never</font>

539
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,149
could log in the accounting data from

540
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,100
that session because the session was

541
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,140
interrupted it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrapped up and so</font>

542
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,908
we were then able to access other

543
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,710
systems and literally make sure no one

544
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:00,539
else got built again the only usages

545
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,070
electricity of course today<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

546
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:05,640
stuff would not fall within the legal

547
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,350
framework but in 1974 people weren't

548
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,870
thinking the way we were thinking it's

549
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,178
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like the leading edge and this</font>

550
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,918
stuff and the other interesting thing we

551
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,140
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out is that we wonder okay well we</font>

552
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,789
all have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different user IDs we figured</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> we knew that our high school began</font>

with their

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,250
okay kind of tough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess an eight</font>

556

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:30,900
504 and then we had three public user

558
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:33,120
IDs 9 09 06 19 01 don't ask me<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I</font>

559
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,280

562
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">out till years later that five digit</font>

563
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,150
sequence was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York State five</font>

564
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,570
digit code for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular high</font>

565
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,950
school well one day at time I was in

567
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of lubed in that computer room see</font>

568
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,169
back then being<font color="#CCCCCC"> a geek wasn't cool today</font>

569
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,820
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more but yeah nobody</font>

570
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:58,049
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to you essentially so</font>

evenings weekends playing with stuff and

573
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,530
said hey let me generate a random string

574
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,049
of a thousand ? a thousand that says

575
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:09,658
give me 1,000 random numbers from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to</font>

576
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:12,980
a thousand and I printing and I start

577
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:17,730
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the list they see 909</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 60</font>

578
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">1901 so what's the next one yes I don't</font>

579
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,470
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that something else is so I</font>

580
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:26,429
try to log in 1650 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth it did and</font>

581
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:29,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">I men</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to something log out log could</font>

582
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,360
try the next one it says number lock see

583
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:32,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">back then we didn't really have good</font>

584
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,479
things if you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right ID ID but</font>

585
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,159
the wrong password it would kind of give

586
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,289
you clue it says you got the number that

587
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,340
works but the number is locked today<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

588
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:41,129
course you don't want it saw somebody

589
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,408
said hey you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> close it hidden</font>

590
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,820
were mad<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rio oil try something else</font>

591
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:46,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">there a change that fourth character he</font>

592
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,750
might get in so all of a sudden wait a

593
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:53,700
minute so if that's this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this off we</font>

594
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:55,380
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 IDs 1650 for 116 525 and I jump</font>

595
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,159
down to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next kind of batching that</font>

596
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:02,039
list that that debt and work and all of

597
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,809
a sudden we've got all the user numbers

598
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:06,960
for every high school in western New

599
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:09,720
York as kind of a throw there right a

600
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,970
little bit of adrenaline rush and<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

601
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,580
then mr. Berg walks in the computer

602
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,730
teacher as a how you doing marketing

603
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,039
haha all this oh nothing nothing to look

604
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,750
at here move along move along and I was

605
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,860
like hyperventilating thank you know

606
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,600
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose this and we just</font>

607
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,010
found it and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find out the</font>

608
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,990
back then all you security that we

609
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,280
thought were secure really<font color="#CCCCCC"> words secure</font>

610
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,279
what's the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pseudo-random</font>

611
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,360
numbers not much

612
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,200
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ever try to do web crack or</font>

613
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,820
anything like that or you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

614
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,590
IV lots of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at today we</font>

615
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,149
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some poor assumptions</font>

616
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,178
that are put into security that's still

617
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:45,469
carry forward so anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're like okay</font>

618
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:50,100
this computer is cool it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty neat</font>

619
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:52,019
but we need more so what about then

620
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,928
there is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity one 1975 and the</font>

621
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,779
January issue of popular electronics

622
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:59,730
guess it was featured on the cover

623
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:01,440
really the first personal computer you

624
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:04,200
could build and by called the Altair

625
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,760
8800<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably heard of the Altair</font>

626
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,260
8800 it's in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smithsonian one of them</font>

627
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,779
is anyway I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it's the one we</font>

628
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,980
built but we built one we ordered<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

629
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:15,090
we got two kids together when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a</font>

630
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,380
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> minds like three hundred eighty</font>

631
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:22,049
bucks now back then I work a paper route

632
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,240
that paid one point eight cents per

633
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:25,918
daily delivery in five point six cents

634
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,539
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday so you scrape all that</font>

635
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,179
money together<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few bucks</font>

636
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,639
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the week so three hundred</font>

637
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:35,909
dollars was a fortune but he pulled

638
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:37,168
about 10 or 12 of us together and we got

639
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:39,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money together and we found an</font>

640
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:41,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">adviser and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> formed this club and so</font>

641
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,529
we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we ordered</font>

642
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,059
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the thing shows up in the mail</font>

643
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great we open up guess</font>

644
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:53,428
what's in the box farts some<font color="#E5E5E5"> assembly</font>

645
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:59,149
required a lot of assembly required it's

646
00:23:53,429 --> 00:24:04,049
got circuit boards<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay resistors diodes</font>

647
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:07,709
capacitors white there's no bus on there

648
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:10,889
any I got this LEDs the front panel say

649
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:14,059
holy mackerel a like got to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

650
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:16,500
whole thing so I and like one ship

651
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:18,418
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is automated just that one</font>

652
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,730
sea view everything else is all done in

653
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:23,610
old-style electronics well okay fine so

654
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,590
we'll give it a shot<font color="#E5E5E5"> so off we go so we</font>

655
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,719
divvy this thing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we take home</font>

656
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,809
aboard and we know solder this thing on

657
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,220
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you go okay silver orange greet</font>

658
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:33,418
you after a while you finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn what</font>

659
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,399
all those not those bands are in a

660
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:37,950
resistor kind of a lost art it's like

661
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:39,029
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a slide rule which we</font>

662
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,039
had to hear spec done because their own

663
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,539
a pocket calculators actually I did get

664
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,490
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> daddy bought me one I think was a</font>

665
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,850
tenth grade for chemistry it was a plus

666
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,970
mine

667
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,419
x divided took six double a cell

668
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:56,310
batteries it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred dollars in</font>

669
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:59,130
1973 pardon the boom our brain<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

670
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember the name of that thing was yeah</font>

671
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,240
I remember my friend Howard<font color="#CCCCCC"> hall had a</font>

672
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,220
cool one with the numbers the head and

673
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,900
standardized yet on how the LEDs and be

674
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,280
straight lines this had curved things it

675
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,440
was like really weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at because</font>

676
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,240
a six came down and back and around it

677
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked like some little symbol from the</font>

678
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">cult so we had these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things so we</font>

679
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,470
started building it put the board

680
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,629
together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finally you pass it</font>

681
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,830
out on the next guy who would inspect it

682
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,630
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't have any cold</font>

683
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,830
solder joins you to roast any component

684
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,060
so you missed<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and you got the</font>

685
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">right things in the right place this</font>

686
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,690
took about three months<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christina you're</font>

687
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,129
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to school and you're doing</font>

688
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,600

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,910
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you gotta babysit for</font>

690
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,000
little brothers and sisters I learned to

691
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">wake up like this for my mom didn't know</font>

692
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,800
realize it at the time but I was the

693
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">eldest of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six and you stay up late doing</font>

694
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,919
stuff like that so you come home<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

704
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,490
seconds very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful anyway we call these</font>

705
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:14,400
boys<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ricci put em together and say</font>

706

<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Showtime well the oldest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy in</font>

707
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,090
our group was Tom Richmond time was a

708
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,410
senior I was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of big and time I end</font>

709
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,780
up going on to brown he ended up in his

710
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">master's and at Northwestern and did</font>

711
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,230
really well so we went over his house we

712
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,520
went down to the basement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

713
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,830
assembled this whole thing in there on

714
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,700
his ping-pong table in his mom's house

715
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:37,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then we got ready to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in the one</font>

716
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:41,670
ship the bigs with the z80 I remember

717
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:43,169
zdat chip well we didn't want to do is

718
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:46,350
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> miss his warning</font>

719
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:48,390
static charge might destroy chip so we

720
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,610
can't afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so we took a big piece</font>

721
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">of copper wire we tied it around Tom's</font>

722
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,860
risks we tied the other end of the

723
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">drainpipe of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the basement</font>

724
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,780
okay this guy's not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere okay</font>

725
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:01,600
he's part of a circuit and he takes the

726
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:04,629
thing out he ever so carefully puts it

727
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">right into the socket and we all step</font>

728
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:12,370
back hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> our breath that we turn it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

729
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:17,260
and it doesn't work it's got about three

730
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:20,129
lights that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know ah</font>

731
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,870
no I mean it could be any of a thousand

732
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,520
little solder joints the tiniest there

733
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,129
something in backwards reverse it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

734
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,360
just upload to spare at this point I

735
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,669
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are we gonna do</font>

736
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,080
anyway Little Billy Richmond is still in

737
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:33,520
junior high school little roly-poly keep

738
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,500
with big curly hair he cut down<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

739
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,389
hey kids where<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you guys where you're</font>

740
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,280
doing down here and he walks<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

741
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">English classes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hello big thing isn't</font>

742
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,100
pushed in let me put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and he</font>

743
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:46,679
reaches it with his thumb to push the

744
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,678
chip in and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little like</font>

745
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:55,899
and that was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem the chip wasn't</font>

746
00:27:52,450 --> 00:28:03,820
seated it worked perfectly after that so

747
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:05,080
Billy lived so we we've got this

748
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,580
computer we started saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

749
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">we going to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it well the only way</font>

750
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,540
you could program the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> Altair was</font>

751
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:14,290
with the switches on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front 0 1 1 0 0</font>

752
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:16,120
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took</font>

753
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:18,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">a long time to get a program in and then</font>

754
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,540
you run the thing and it and then the

755
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,150
light pattern would end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'd</font>

756
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,820
have to decipher the code because octal

757
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:26,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">face ate it didn't you write down there</font>

758
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer okay well I was</font>

759
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,559
pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's kind of primitive</font>

760
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,419
we need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more we had some sharp</font>

761
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,580
guys in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one carrying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his name</font>

762
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:36,160
was Mark Maret he ended up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year</font>

763
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,320
winning the Junior Achievement invention

764
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,510
of the Year award nationally for coming

765
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,460
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a 99 cent circuit tester which</font>

766
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:46,840
is basically neon bulb two wires put in

767
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,549
a test tube poor and a little stuff that

768
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,110
hardens into like white clay soil and

769
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,720
off you want my way he said hey let's

770
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,699
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interface so he built from a</font>

771
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,429
little touch tone pad and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre</font>

772
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,410
character LED display a keyboard and a

773
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:01,929
display so we could go one three seven

774
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,070
to 12 13 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we can host your</font>

775
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:04,330
program in there you could run it you

776
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,730
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the display right back out that was</font>

777
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,629
pretty cool for those of us who aren't

778
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,860
so hardware mine

779
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,900
the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys we were writing a</font>

780
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,280
basic interpreter with Eric compiler so

781
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,500
I was doing along<font color="#CCCCCC"> divided routines I</font>

782
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,820
drew some of the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the the short</font>

783
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,930
straw is trying to go do the tough stuff

784
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we were writing all the stuff I only</font>

785
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 4k to work with but we built all</font>

786
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,330
this stuff we got it working we got the

787
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,890
basic running everything like that now

788
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:29,139
what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time 1975</font>

789
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:34,300
guy by the name of Bill Gates looks at

790
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:35,710
the out there and says microsoft the guy

791
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,280
by the name of Steve Jobs looks at it

792
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:42,280
with his buddy was and he goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple and</font>

793
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,639
we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it we said let's take it to</font>

794
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,690
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> school assembly make it play music</font>

795
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,760
because if you took a little AM radio

796
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,710
and you put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> next to the CPU and you</font>

797
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">ran a certain series of no ops it would</font>

798
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:57,490
go you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it play a song oh dude</font>

799
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,350
dude and that's was our highest

800
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:03,340
achievement we made it play music at a

801
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:05,320
school assembly and what we didn't

802
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,389
realize is at the time we had Microsoft

803
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,030
and we had apple in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the palms of our</font>

804
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:15,250
hands but none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us had the vision to</font>

805
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:17,139
know what to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so you know none</font>

806
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,120
of us got incredibly wealthy out of that

807
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,110
so that's life I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not bitter</font>

808
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,939
about or anything but but it does show

809
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,110
the importance of vision and why it's

810
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,470
important to be to look ahead and have

811
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,850
some idea of what you want to do because

812
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,710
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have tremendous opportunities</font>

813
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,659
in front of you and not know what they

814
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,400
are and it's also real danger being way

815
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,170
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tail being too far ahead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve</font>

816
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,690
if you're one step ahead of everybody

817
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:43,620
else where they call you consultant

818
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,550
right if you're two steps ahead you're

819
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,439
visionary and if you're three steps

820
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,870
ahead you're a profit if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're for more</font>

821
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,130
you're a lunatic because you're so far

822
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,600
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't going to</font>

823
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">accept what you've got to say because</font>

824
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,510
they don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's valid they</font>

825
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,920
don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's true so you got</font>

826
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,090
to be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay grounded where</font>

827
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,960
everybody else is coming from from a

828
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:03,310
reference point because otherwise what

829
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,690
it is that you say what it is you

830
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,429
believe what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you try to convey in</font>

831
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:11,110
terms of ideas just won't work and

832
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:13,690
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit tough so between</font>

833
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,189
building the Altair working on this APL

834
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,870

888
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,340
to eight characters so we've got four

889
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,480
random numbers at the end it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

890
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,620
to be the same pseudo-random sequence

891
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,870
we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to that and okay</font>

892
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,239
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a job working at two dollars</font>

893
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,350
and ten cents an hour at 40 hours a week

894
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,120
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state of New York and it was</font>

895
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually below minimum wage because 230</font>

896
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,600
was a minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> wage I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

897
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,040
worked a night job at the corner grocery

898
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,899
store three nights a week tuesday

899
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,690
wednesday friday isn't like that is the

900
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,930
night manager so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would average a 63</font>

901
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,610
hour

902
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:42,730
work week and would take home about a

903
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:45,520
hundred bucks 9800 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> F tax whatever was</font>

904
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:49,450
that's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but back then it was</font>

905
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:51,400
great because in the mid-70s in Buffalo

906
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,380
bethlehem steel plant shut down Bell

907
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,970
aerospace shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford shut down all</font>

908
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the plant shut down nobody had any work</font>

909
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,550
unemployment was up around twenty-seven

910
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,160
percent it was like some<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-world</font>

911
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:01,450
nation and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember mark Simon who is</font>

912
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,730
our valedictorian from her high school

913
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,160
class came by my store one evening they

914
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,350
can I put this in the window sign that

915
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,420
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> Heisler college freshman willing to</font>

916
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,650
do any type of yard work cheap I mean

917
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,780
that's how desperate we were for money

918
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,740
so I thought I had it pretty good and I

919
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,020
was working there and I also had a

920
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:19,540
chance an offer from the high school<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

921
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,100
write the curriculum for the computer

922
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">science class for the next year but I</font>

923
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,190
didn't have time I mean you're already

924
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,830
working out 62 63 hours a week you're

925
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:29,380
tapped out so at that point I figured

926
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:32,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">well you know what are you gonna do so</font>

927
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,910
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> head off for college and</font>

928
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,810
poking through different card<font color="#E5E5E5"> catalogs</font>

929
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:37,029
and things like that I'm one of the

930
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,259
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had wanted to do is you know if</font>

931
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,120
I'd be need to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in need</font>

932
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,200
like MIT or whatever well it didn't

933
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,389
quite have the best grades<font color="#E5E5E5"> in high</font>

934
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,799
school I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart enough but you learn</font>

935
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:47,339
early on in life it's a big difference

936
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,570
between capability and achievement

937
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,490
sometimes that gets worse as you get

938
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,500
older I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> mines actually gotten</font>

939
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,149
better at timely catching up why did my

942
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:01,299
say see I could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it back then</font>

1028
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,920
is they had kind of like a primitive

1029
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:00,210
version of APL up and running and I was

1030
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to look at how to convert things</font>

over the age of 30 here anybody still

1037
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:17,038
programming<font color="#CCCCCC"> COBOL know what happened all</font>

1038
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,240
the COBOL programmers get back working

1039
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,849
at Burger King now that white suitcase

1040

1045
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,000
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could but Pascal somebody's</font>

1046
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,180
making a Fortran you hear these names

1047
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">there ok well one evening I'm sitting</font>

1048
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,200
there working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer and we're</font>

1049
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,020
going to Pascal I already taking the

1050
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,759
course I go oh here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a manual amazing</font>

1051
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,180
what you find when you read manuals and

1052
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,410
it says files can have passwords they

1053
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,569
can be locked<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could be controlled</font>

1054
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,970
and I said none of these come password

1055
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:55,680
none of these compilers now these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1056
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,959
have any passwords on them I mean it's

1057
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,160
like wide open we've been working on his

1058
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,930
mainframe for years there's like no

1059
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,799
security so guess what i thought it

1060
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:07,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">needed a password so i said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let's see</font>

1061
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:10,049
can i password protect it yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok one</font>

1062
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:12,569
password protected that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

1063
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you could do with a rename command so</font>

1064
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:16,650
i renamed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pascal compiler to the</font>

1065
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,240
fortran compiler and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it renamed the</font>

1066
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:22,859
fortran compiler to the pascal compiler

1067
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think i just experimenting and not</font>

1068
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,490
realizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a huge project</font>

due in both classes the next day so

1070
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,029
there's people lined up with their job

1071
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,680
decks in front of these big machines if

1072
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:33,299
all the student university places and

1073
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,440
the guy puts of his<font color="#CCCCCC"> pascal dr.</font>

1074
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:37,440
interconnection it comes out with

1075
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,299
Fortran compilers the guys are the 4 10

1076
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,069
people are going nuts everywhere and

1077
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:42,569
they're panicking I'm just sitting there

1078
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:44,058
in the quiet little<font color="#CCCCCC"> back room guy using</font>

1079
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:46,470
one these newfangled things called a CRT

1080
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:47,549
cuz i'm not doing jobs that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a live</font>

1081
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,129
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> this must be the way of the</font>

1082
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:51,809
future type in a way it's like okay well

1083
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,010
put them back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said well i guess</font>

1084
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:55,319
they should be password protected site

1085
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:59,000
password protected them and I decided

1086
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:59,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doe cave I'll go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

1087
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,440
as I'm walking out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this back room</font>

1088
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,810
through the computing center this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

1089
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes banging out one of the doors he</font>

1091
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,360
they've got the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> out compiler to</font>

1092
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,640
other everywhere I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

good and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably I already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1095
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,819

1096
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,990
you never a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> there unless you</font>

00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,650
went that way that it did but you're

1118
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,730
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve our security</font>

1119
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,100
incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was pretty cool about it</font>

1120
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:08,390
because again if you were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be</font>

1121
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,890
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for doing the V malicious we</font>

1122
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,930
just say I'm experimenting but it just

1123
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">shows you the poor the danger it's like</font>

1124
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,230
chemistry a little bit of knowledge is

1125
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,790
dangerous you can pull yourself up and

1126
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,500
so work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the computer systems a</font>

1127
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:21,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being knowledge could be</font>

1128
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,630
dangerous and so it got that up and

1129
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">running and then I figured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay meet</font>

1130
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,380
something better than that so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer</font>

1131
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:29,300
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> junior year got a job for one of</font>

1132
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,330
the bank's down in Chicago and that paid

1133
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,460
850 an hour or the 650 I got 650 an

1134
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">hour's like we're still slave ways you</font>

1135
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">figures 2000 hours a year that's still</font>

1136
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,130
13 grand for doing applications

1137
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,790
development and what they had is they

1138
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,830
had an installation of APL and it ran

1139
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,480
their whole bond evaluation system where

1140
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,009
they bought and sold hundreds of

1141
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,020
millions of dollars of bonds for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1142
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,190
biggest institutional clients and what

1143
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,340
they were had is they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1144
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:57,260
timeshare system up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Toronto and they</font>

1145
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,340
wanted to transfer it to their own IBM

1146
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,560
because they finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> saved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up enough</font>

1147
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">money at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bank to buy their own IBM</font>

1148
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,400
370 they want to pull in locally problem

1149
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,339
was the dialects of APL were a little

1150
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,270
bit different so this one you have

1151
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,560
stomach hole in but this one you have a

1152
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,940
comma well this when you have this and

1153
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,980
so what they had is they had three

1154
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,350
people in our bank working

1155
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,550
full<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for the whole summer</font>

1156
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,319
translating all these programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one to</font>

1157
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,030
the other well that seems pretty lame

1158
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,710
job but hey the money was good you ride

1159
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,990
the Ellen for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 Cent's back and forth</font>

1160
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,400
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money well first day on</font>

1161
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,689
the job and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I'm looking ahead he</font>

1162
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,520
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to log in you got ID and</font>

1163
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,690
password and I thinking like well you

1164
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,060
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a PL I wonder how it works</font>

1165
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:32,800
so go poking around and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing said</font>

1166
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,799
to do oh there we go oh it's the whole

1167
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,710

1168
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,869
locked up but you know hacker right now

1169
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,090
you get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so I printed it out</font>

1170
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:45,460
and I brought it in to see my boss and

1171

1186
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:18,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">been using the system for three years</font>

1187
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:22,570
we've never had a problem with it can't

let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of so fix that for them so</font>

1189
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:26,859
you kind of walk around with this via

1190
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,720
electronic screwdriver unscrewing

1191
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:30,100
people's beds security<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said but</font>

1194
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on this program to reap we change</font>

1195
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,868
all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> around guys that's very</font>

1196
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,020
very important we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need you this in-house</font>

1197
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:43,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">i said all these changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are very</font>

1198
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:46,090
deterministic that is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't change</font>

1199
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,950
everything this goes to that that could

1200
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,340
be done by a computer program i can

1201
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:52,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">write a program to do the whole thing</font>

1202
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I kind of look at me it's like is</font>

1203
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,629
this kid nuts or what I don't let the

1204
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,368
union's find out about them so they said

1205
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,960
I'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1206
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:03,550
put together and a test around and I

1207
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,380
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> look here we go it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run all night</font>

1208
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,300
long it was running a timeshare speed

1209
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:11,350
but it will convert the entire program

1210
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:13,030
and so we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and it worked and did</font>

1211
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,500
basically what was set aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:31,400

had for the master-at-arms the police

1449
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:29,680
force they had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> random number generator</font>

1450
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:30,940
so that when they did the urinalysis it

1451
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,698
would come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a random number from</font>

1452
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,469
1 to 20 1 through 10 and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1459
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,900
the same suit of random seed over and

<font color="#CCCCCC">military today a special account when</font>

1479
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:32,799
the ship was in the shipyard and the

1480
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:34,299
ship shifted home port to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> east coast</font>

1481
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,819
he figured the vendor would never find

1482
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:39,099
him so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stopped paying the bill</font>

1483
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:40,630
they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> him so we had we had our</font>

1484
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:42,999
computer systems repossessed and so the

1485

1487
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:50,079
but then after that I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

1488
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:51,309
went out and want to a computer security

1489

1492
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:59,319
Navy has no<font color="#E5E5E5"> need for computer security</font>

1493
00:53:55,859 --> 00:54:01,029

1499
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:10,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't do both so I said well how</font>

00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:14,650
and learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start a corporation in</font>

1502
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:16,599
three years I could hire people out of

1503
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,549
national security agency instead of dead

1504
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:19,719
ending my career there so I did that's

1505
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:20,920
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got another reserves and that's</font>

1506
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:23,589
why i started National Security

1507
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,029
Corporation which I started two years in

1508
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:25,808
six months after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I left active duty and</font>

1509
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:26,979
that's been my little consulting

1510
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:29,529
business that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done all these years</font>

1511
00:54:26,979 --> 00:54:30,759
and haven't run it past me mostly

1512
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:32,019
because I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy doing the</font>

1513
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:34,509
speaking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consulting and things</font>

1514
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:35,468
like that and you know when you hire

1515
00:54:34,509 --> 00:54:36,549
somebody then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1516
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:38,739
commitments that come with which isn't

1517
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:40,538
bad but I know within a year of hiring

1518
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:42,339
my first employee I'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 it just</font>

1519
00:54:40,539 --> 00:54:45,700
off it goes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nice having some</font>

1520
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:49,450
independence what you find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> though is</font>

1521
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,979
that I was talking before with Marcus

1522
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,660
random weird a panel last year and

1523
00:54:50,979 --> 00:54:54,460
Marcus gave some recommendations in

1524
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,839
terms of jobs and careers one things he

1525
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,130
said is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pick out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want so</font>

1526
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,960
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in management you want</font>

1527
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,239
to go run corporations go do that if you

1528
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,619
want to be technical go do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1529
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:04,690
try to do both it's a recipe for

money but

1671
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:54,779
in trouble it's a bid<font color="#E5E5E5"> and half price</font>

1672
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:56,370
maybe he'll take it I don't know don't

1673
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,990
be worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being embarrassed about</font>

1674
00:59:56,370 --> 01:00:00,390
trying something and not succeeding

1675
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:02,609
failure is part of life it's the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1676
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:04,230
measuring your ability to try things if

1677
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:05,160
you're not encountering failure every

1678
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:06,360
now and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> only if you're not trying</font>

1679
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:10,310
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough you're not pushing the</font>

01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,310
envelope be willing to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes and</font>

1681
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:15,080
lastly a little bit of philosophy that

1682
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,730
it come from that group here I've never

1683
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,140
yeah I've you know these is a saying are

1684
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:20,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a hacker well let's face it Albert</font>

1685
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,170
Einstein hack Newtonian physics right

1686
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:23,670
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole idea of hacking an</font>

1687
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:25,200
intellectual pursuit of being able to

1688
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,670
produce an outcome that the designers of

1689
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,990
the system that were intended but you

1690
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:29,700
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the rules can't change the</font>

1691
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:30,930
laws of<font color="#CCCCCC"> physics can't change what the</font>

1692
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,740
chip works but you're still going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1693
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,660
help with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the result that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1694
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:36,120
work so we had some of the smartest

1695
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:38,430
people in America here actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:40,080
around around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country around the</font>

1697
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:43,020
world that's some friends here from

1698
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:44,009
Canada to any way from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe okay so</font>

1699
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:47,430
you got one guy who came here farther

1700
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:49,050
than I did too but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look around</font>

1701
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:50,580
sometimes you find that never seen a

1702
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:55,290
bigger mismatch between financial

1703
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:56,940
success and intellectual ability than I

1704
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:59,070
have in the hacking community I don't

1705
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,690
know why other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the fact that</font>

1706
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:05,790
perhaps we're so good at living in

1707
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:07,770
cyberspace that we forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a</font>

1708
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:11,520
consensual hallucination if you've ever

hallucination and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's a year</font>
