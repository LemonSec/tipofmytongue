1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,029
okay there's two talks left today well

2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,439
actually technically four because the

3
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,289
final talk of the day is three guys

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,880
talking in 20 minute talks all about

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,480
roughly the same thing it's actually

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,849
really cool but up now is a I think

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,440
you've spoken at what three layer ones

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,670
now yeah luis eduardo comes back every

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,070
year was something new and different and

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,960
this year he's worked on working on

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,260
something called echolocation for Wi-Fi

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,340
or is it just echo Wi-Fi location

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:49,199
whatever the end result is the idea of

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,390
trying to track somebody as they move

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,000
through publicly available access points

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,110
to find out where their location is

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,719
taking advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the worldwide</font>

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:06,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">linksys network in order to follow</font>

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:13,369

21
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:19,140

22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking thanks for letting me do that</font>

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,979
and this is something hopefully cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,680
gave a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this tour Colorado a</font>

28
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,000

two months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and how it works the</font>

40

41
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,700
it better yeah for me the possible

42
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,440
models how to implement there are two

43
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways to do that I'm going to talk about</font>

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the possible two ways again this is I</font>

45
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,849
did 11 of you used one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the models</font>

46
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,810
that are created I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

47
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:36,768
phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero that was at torque on and</font>

48
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:38,930
what didn't work then I had phase zero

49
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:42,769
one and it kind of worked have some

50
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,200
stuff to show what we're planning to do

51
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:52,150
next and what else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is out there that do</font>

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:03:00,980
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same thing I'm going to be</font>

53
00:02:52,150 --> 00:03:02,359
okay so this is nothing really<font color="#E5E5E5"> new when</font>

54
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,470
I found this out I'm like oh this is

55
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:05,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool i'm going to do something</font>

56
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,890
really awesome and i found out that

57
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,109
microsoft location find that has been

58
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,119
doing this forever oh and online<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

59
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:13,760
like oh how about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nets number forum and their posts from</font>

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,078
2004 about something related to this I'm

62
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:23,690
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this sucks i'm really outdated</font>

63
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:26,720
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is old forget</font>

64
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,700
about it and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw that when you if</font>

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,530
you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone or any new decent</font>

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,350
phone you have google maps and you say

67
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,959
locate me it uses triangulation from the

68
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:39,019
cell towers to do that but if you have

69
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,390
Wi-Fi enabled it gets more accurate how

70
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,100
does it do that is in a very similar way

71
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,290
it looks at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the access points that</font>

72
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,980
are around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to tell you</font>

73
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,569
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are how does that work so I</font>

74
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,488
started thinking about this I'm like

75
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is really cool is real convenient</font>

76
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,989
but at the same point I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

77
00:03:54,019 --> 00:04:00,549
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people tracking me or somebody</font>

78
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,840
tracking me I'm like so if somebody has

79
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,910
is able to track me I want to do

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that you can use for good or</font>

81
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,620
for bad as well proof of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point here</font>

82
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to say that some</font>

83
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,519
of these services are really good and

84
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,500
they have a meaning but somebody might

85
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">be doing this for bad purposes as well</font>

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:24,360
and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know it so that's it</font>

87
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,900
NM lazy immoral programmer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:33,810
use stuff that is out there and doesn't

89
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:36,270
give me too much work so what is

90
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:41,280
echolocation echolocation is the ability

91
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:45,840
of having problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerPoint</font>

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,138
karaoke here it's a common method of

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,090
information about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a remote object doing</font>

94
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,310
like bouncing signals like radars like

95
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,799
things like that so the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> game echo</font>

96
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:04,199
Wi-Fi location because we use Wi-Fi to

97
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:05,550
do that one way or<font color="#E5E5E5"> another everything</font>

98
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,650
started with understanding how things

99
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,580
were how the existing technology works

100
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,840
when when I say technology I say the the

101
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,609
the tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out there like</font>

102
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,400
Microsoft location finder<font color="#CCCCCC"> app Apple</font>

103
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">iPhone everything that today is using</font>

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,859
that how how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it work how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,400
make this work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,349
about this at the end and then I said

107
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so now that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of understand</font>

108
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,440
how they're doing that I don't want to

109
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,139
do the same thing I want to do something

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the community can benefit from it</font>

111
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:40,349
and again if you think this sucks that's

112
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay too but without reinventing the</font>

113
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:45,050
wheel as i said i'm lazy and I want to

114
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">do things in a smart way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bolton quotes</font>

115
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:52,370
and use the maximum<font color="#E5E5E5"> of existing</font>

116
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,370
technology as possible

117
00:05:55,689 --> 00:06:06,169
so why do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that track people</font>

118
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,479
could be friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some people here use</font>

119
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:09,830
it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter or dodge ball or</font>

120
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,719
something like that it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

121
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,729
tweeter dodgeball kind of thing that you

122
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:15,590
sign up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no website</font>

123
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:17,120
there's nothing but right now like

124
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,818
different users have different devices

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,979
and when you show up somewhere a list of

126
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:24,289
people that you trust are going to say

127
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,810
oh he's around here or his in that place

128
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,370
you can get notified<font color="#CCCCCC"> by SMS who can go</font>

129
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,889
to a website you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

130
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work it yet this is</font>

131
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,860
vapor where you can track your<font color="#E5E5E5"> enemies</font>

132
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:39,620
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't like you drop a</font>

133
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,289
cell phone or a PDA some device that has

134
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,020
Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping somebody scar and see</font>

135
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:47,479
where this person is going to or

136
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,878
tracking the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly or employees</font>

137
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,620
people say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working from home or this</font>

138
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,169
or that and then you find out that this

139
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,909
person is connected to a hot spot in

140
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:59,650
Cancun Mexico or something like that I'm

141
00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:02,870
working so hard and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not</font>

142
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:05,960
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing strike devices some</font>

143
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,509
places I'll even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the US see all the</font>

144
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,080
time that people you read on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the news oh</font>

145
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:14,479
some laptop containing 10 million Social

146
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,430
Security numbers were was strolling

147
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:21,740
somewhere and this and that and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

148
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you track something like this so if you</font>

149
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,639
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a software inside a laptop that's</font>

150
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,529
not going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

151
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,500
steal<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> replace the hard drive and</font>

152
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:33,949
just get rid of it so the idea is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

153
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,909
some Wi-Fi enabled devices could be old

154
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:43,149
SD cards could be the I Phi you guys who

155
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:43,149
knows what the I Phi is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

156
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:54,410
free advertisement I guess this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

157
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:58,220
camera is an SD card but it's a knife I

158
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:01,190
it's an SD card that has Wi-Fi so when

159
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,200
you take a picture it try it connects

160
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,150
tues whatever Network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> programmed and</font>

161
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:10,310
sends the picture uploads to the

162
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:15,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to whatever sir 100 bucks 100</font>

163
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:18,430
bucks so here's one of these things in

164
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:21,920
order to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in otherwise put on a slot</font>

165
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,810
as these lot on a camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> or on a</font>

166
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,550
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that if you</font>

167
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:30,290
can talk to a central server to say what

168
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:35,030
it is that's cool or<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for kicks</font>

169
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">right do whatever so what do you need to</font>

170
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:43,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this work you need monitors AKA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aps</font>

171
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">clients could be laptops could be pda's</font>

172
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:49,880
phones with Wi-Fi anything like that a

173
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,140
location server that would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

174
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,970
the server that knows where everybody is

175
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,830
then our notification server which which

176
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,380
could be the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing could be that</font>

177
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,350
guy sending emails as some answers or

178
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:12,290
just a web posting on a web server

179
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:14,300
seeing what people are this is concern

180
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,189
number one make something that after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

181
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,349
thought this was a good idea had to make

182
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,010
it work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> work efficiently at</font>

183
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:25,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">hopefully across the board something</font>

184
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,620
that is legal to a certain extent in

185
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,020
theory you cannot connect to people's

186
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,020
open wireless networks to this stuff

187
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:40,459
again keep it simple approach and easy

188
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,140
to install especially well if you're a

189
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,650
user that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

190
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that simple but if you don't want if you</font>

191
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,390
want to put in somebody's computer or

192
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,080
cell phone or whatever that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

193
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:56,000
really easy to install in any form that

194
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:02,510
you think like malware kind of thing

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,150
or not so since we have doors or since

196
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:09,560
we know what we had we have to have to

197
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:12,980
get this to work what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do came up with</font>

198
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,810
two models and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

199
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:22,490
each one of them not like this model

200
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:24,319
better dog she's nursing so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

201
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,150
first model the client babies are

202
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,040
intelligent so you have to modify a

203
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,800
piece to do that so you're going to have

204
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,900
the client walking by an AP the AP is

205
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,400
going to look possibly by the mac

206
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,400
address which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not really effective</font>

207
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,709
but oh well and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say well</font>

208
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,630
these guys here they pee has to talk to

209
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:45,830
the server somehow and tell the server

210
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:50,120
this guy I saw this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> around here so</font>

211
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:55,250
that's model number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay enough but</font>

212
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:57,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerPoint magic so again you have</font>

213
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> modify the AP if you want to do that</font>

214
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,610
they d has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligent enough to</font>

215
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:05,210
do that so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably get a linksys</font>

216
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:08,900
wrt and modify the firmware to do

217
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:11,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you wanted to do it has to be</font>

218
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,819
in a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless kind of way why</font>

219
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,820
because you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to use this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ap</font>

220
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,800
that in this case I created so that's

221
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:22,089
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be effective I have a few friends</font>

222
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,120
but still right you need this to be as

223
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:28,640
accurate and broad as possible so i

224
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,880
doubt that people who develop that or

225
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:36,290
help like using this they wouldn't trust

226
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,420
me so how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works the monitors report</font>

227
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,660
back to the server the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stacy and</font>

228
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,579
it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be or not it has to be the</font>

229
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:50,410
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> logical thing is to use a mac</font>

230
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:50,410
address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that security and</font>

231
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:57,829
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that is put a make the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AP</font>

232
00:11:54,529 --> 00:12:01,790
stock somehow in an encrypted way with

233
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,470
the server client base model that's the

234
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,199
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually tried to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

235
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,670
the client once it seems on any<font color="#CCCCCC"> p</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

236
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,070
it can't connect is going to go back to

237
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server and say hey I'm here and</font>

238
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:16,640
could be any type of packet we're going

239
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:18,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about that but at the end the</font>

240
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,300
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to have to connect to a</font>

241
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,940
wireless network that's the problem

242
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,010
right can you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> any network can</font>

243
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,610
you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what type of packets are</font>

244
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,470
going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that network and by</font>

245
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,290
the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the client is coming</font>

246
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:38,350
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server is going to know where</font>

247
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,349
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is does it work we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

248
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,470
so what's the special software right we

249
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,779
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> develop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a client before for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

250
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,460
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to the server the very</font>

251
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,140
first thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> came to mind when I</font>

252
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,040
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this was use some type of</font>

253
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,620
VPN client so I have a VPN server if you

254
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,469
BN concentrator as the server and use

255
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,500
most of the devices today's have some

256
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,260
type of VPN client so the very first

257
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,260
device that I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use was a</font>

258
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,230
blackberry a Wi-Fi only blackberry that

259
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,000
I happen to have and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't work the</font>

260
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:18,080
client pretty much sucks I couldn't get

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,880
it to work so could be me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm not that</font>

262
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:25,790
bright either but so that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

263
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,660
things King some people told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

264
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,849
some type of DNS approach since DNS goes

265
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,819
through everything so it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

266
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:38,900
special probe client that uses some type

267
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:41,630
of UDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 4053 for that that would work</font>

268
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:45,470
or even use some type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS client that</font>

269
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:52,240
uses some flags that are not used so my

270
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:56,330
server would look for that again so

271
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,580
number two their problem is has to

272
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,650
connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh usually has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to an</font>

273
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,390
open network that could be a problem

274
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,199
right you cannot connect to people's

275
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,300
open

276
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,550
networks they're stupid they're open

277
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,000
some people do that by choice but some

278
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,800
people don't and apparently if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,110
connect to match your Wi-Fi networks

280
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,849
that should be ok but some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

281
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,700
have captive portals and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font>

282
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:23,870
any other traffic after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say yeah I'm</font>

283
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:26,600
not going to do anything wrong except so

284
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,730
that could be a problem ideally I wanted

285
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:34,730
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could work with any</font>

286
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:36,710
network that didn't happen yet and we

287
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,490
talked about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a what type of</font>

288
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:45,970
protocol to use to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server</font>

289
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:45,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">and yeah talked about this already</font>

290
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,800
challenged you there are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

291
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,590
platforms if you have cell phones you

292
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,900
have the iphone you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have windows CD bays</font>

293
00:14:54,590 --> 00:15:01,670
you have what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nokia forgot now</font>

294
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:04,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">symbian thank you you have seen me and</font>

295
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have many other options as for</font>

296
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:10,640
computers you have linux you have

297
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:13,099
windows you have my mac OS and unless

298
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,160
you want to use a device so like a the

299
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,860
SD card that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said with Wi-Fi there are</font>

300
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,300
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> old ones that do the same thing but</font>

301
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">you should be able to program these guys</font>

302
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,959
and ripe in memory like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car in</font>

303
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:28,609
flash to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server then</font>

304
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,830
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> model but the more i think</font>

305
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,290
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually makes more sense kind</font>

306
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of more sense but uses stompbox those</font>

307
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:39,530
evdo routers so we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

308
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,209
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet and it's going to</font>

309
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">look for the for the for the clients but</font>

310
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,960
since it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be moving how do you know</font>

311
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:53,900
where it is so you could modify that two

312
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,960
or number one use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the existing GPRS</font>

313
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,689
network or a video don't kind of like

314
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,240
the approach and I wouldn't put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

315
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:05,570
I thought I didn't the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

316
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,180
should be modified<font color="#E5E5E5"> ephemeral for example</font>

317
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kyocera box that you have like GPL</font>

318
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,560
firmer for that and make that talk to

319
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,040
the central server and say I saw this

320
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,469
guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> around here</font>

321
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:26,920
so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did at first does anybody know</font>

322
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:26,920
what this thing is no okay I mode

323
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,270
japanese cartoon from the 60s late 60s

324
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,910
I'm not that old but the ticket cartoon

325
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,220
is it's phantom i think is it the name

326
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:47,390
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the villain of the the thing</font>

327
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:50,149
just google for it phantom so what about

328
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,250
doing 30 that somehow worked a mix of

329
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:57,140
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> approaches I had a server I had</font>

330
00:16:52,250 --> 00:17:00,380
somehow control over the AP so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

331
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">were not modified 80s but I distributed</font>

332
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,720
amongst friends say plug this in your

333
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,760
home network they're like no I won't do

334
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,770
that like please do it i'm not doing

335
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,109
anything bad they're like no I don't

336
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:19,670
trust you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm like okay so they did that</font>

337
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">i use the VPN concentrator was parsing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">idea sounds simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to me but the</font>

342
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,250
monitors had to be an open system

343
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">network that's how the so i told the</font>

344

client connect to any network once you

connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the network VPN close the VPN</font>

346
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:56,540
with the server what<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't work again</font>

347
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was using the blackberry and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

348
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:02,240
the device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had that I could play</font>

349
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,428
with it and I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever it comes with</font>

350
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,429
like four or five types of VPN clients

351
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,530
and apparently none of them were to talk

352
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:14,990
to my server so that was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

353
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:17,270
couldn't pass the i key negotiation so

354
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,860
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> us right before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> torque on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

355
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,720
said oh that's great he call is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

356
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,750
love me I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any really thing to</font>

357
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,220
show but

358
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,350
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-minute talk and everybody's all</font>

359
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,690
good idea get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of here let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drink</font>

360
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:37,830
here so post work on what would I do no

361
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:41,430
actual coding done you know so I got it

362
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:43,080
so happened what happened work sent me

363
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,360
to a few places<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like okay this is a</font>

364
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,990
good good<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to test this so let's</font>

365
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this work so lame and I use my own</font>

366
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,830
laptop with the VPN client that the

367
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,290
windows one that works with my server

368
00:18:52,830 --> 00:19:00,990
I'm like oh ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this work so</font>

369
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:04,680
let's see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened I use so now so</font>

370
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,990
step by step here so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can make</font>

371
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:11,010
the client talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the server now it's</font>

372
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:14,240
really easy I just had to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some tools</font>

373
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:17,190
like Nat Geo who knows what natgeo is

374
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,740
NAT Geo's what maps IP addresses to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

375
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,440
locations and some of these services

376
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,620
they actually give you latitude and

377
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,680
longitude for whatever IP address not

378
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">that accurate not as cool as what the</font>

379
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:35,010
other services are doing but somehow

380
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:41,880
actually it's not that bad that's it

381
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:44,550
that's it that was a problem this laptop

382
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,260
the day before I started like that I

383
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,110
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the road I found out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

384
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,760
pcmcia slot wasn't working so I wanted

385
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,379
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take some sniffle traces of different</font>

386
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,540
things including the services that are

387
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,280
currently out there and I couldn't

388
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">because my internal wireless card</font>

389
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,680
doesn't work with omni peak so that was

390
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,990
a bummer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sniffer</font>

391
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,590
choices before the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the I Phi</font>

392
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:09,840
and laptops windows laptops using

393
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">microsoft location finder the only one</font>

394
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually didn't do anything was</font>

395
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone because my phone was hijacked</font>

396
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:21,389
as well so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it looks like</font>

397
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,610
and there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> storm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stock that you</font>

398
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">cannot usually see anything so I try to</font>

399
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:29,159
make it a little bigger so after

400
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,179
polishing and cleaning the logs what do

401
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,549
you see you see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamp that they</font>

402
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:37,999
eight and time and what IP address that

403
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:43,610
guy connected from obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was in</font>

404
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:45,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">latin america</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 some</font>

405
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:49,850
cases i was back here in connections but

406
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,499
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's the basic thing that</font>

407
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,480
you have to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> so once you know</font>

408
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:55,879
the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

409
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,009
and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to suck because</font>

410
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,799
it really cannot see anything but

411
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,799
basically gives you the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

412
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,590
country it's coming from or state if

413
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:10,700
you're in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. latitude longitude</font>

414
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:15,559
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP that is connecting from so</font>

415
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:20,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's then you have some cool stuff and</font>

416
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:23,899
after that that was for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

417
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,999
letters so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that we have if you go</font>

418
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:28,729
to code google com there are several

419
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:33,950
like cool projects that use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

420
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:35,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">API ice for integrating maps with spread</font>

421
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,409
to Google Docs and things like that so

422
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:42,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on the laziness our way into I got</font>

423
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:45,259
all that information put it on google

424
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:50,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">docs use the spreadsheet and then use</font>

425
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:52,369
one of these google code projects to

426
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:56,178
your map to the latitude and longitude

427
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:58,189
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear LS and actually kind of works so</font>

428
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:00,529
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is missing there that I wish I</font>

429
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,070
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done battles where I was like</font>

430
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:06,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sequence so if i go back here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

431
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,999
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly where like I started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

432
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:10,009
start-up door and that was the last

433
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:14,869
place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was down there if you look</font>

434
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:16,549
in the map<font color="#CCCCCC"> its I need to I should have</font>

435
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,959
put like labels they're saying he was

436
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:24,220
here first and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here he went</font>

437
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,220
there and etc so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

438
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:30,999
we don't know some of these services

439
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:35,659
they're really doing some cool stuff

440
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:38,899
some are paid some are free still but

441
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:40,009
some are paid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i'm going to</font>

442
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,779
try to do something else with this

443
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:43,399
unless somebody comes back to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

444
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:46,639
oh this is really cool we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should do</font>

445
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:50,119
something with this and leave it open to

446
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:52,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the community to use it if we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

447
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:55,458
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be this develop</font>

client a decent client across like

449
00:22:55,459 --> 00:23:01,159
multiple platforms to make sure it works

450
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:05,599
it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> V doesn't have to be VPN</font>

451
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:07,039
could be anything else totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> alternate</font>

452
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">the integration with nat geo or</font>

453
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:14,619
something like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course with</font>

454
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:18,109
google maps google maps would be cool

455
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:19,968
real-time notification so this guy's

456
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:21,739
here you can say tell me when you see

457
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:23,959

458
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:27,950
in email or SMS or something like that

475
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:19,309
make sure that whatever services

476
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:22,879
whatever is on my cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone is doing</font>

477
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:24,678
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am expecting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to do so when i</font>

478
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:26,899
say locate me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to make sure that</font>

479
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,509
it's not sending somebody that shouldn't

480
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:31,189
be knowing where i am and it's really

481
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to</font>

482
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,740
no if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the right thing or</font>

483
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:40,880
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft location services or</font>

484
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,950
location finder if you probably know

485
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,150
that better than I do but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it does</font>

486
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:49,730
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has like a 60 mag outdated database</font>

487
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,440
that is in your laptop so if you search

488
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,100
for something in that folder you're

489
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,800
going to see a 60 mag password protected

490
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:02,629
I didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to try to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

491
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,580
password found for the old one but all

492
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,740
information is there meaning when you

493
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,750
say locate me it looks at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the access</font>

494
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,910
points looks for the bssid of those

495
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,610
access points and compared to that table

496
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:16,880
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say you must be here so that's</font>

497
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:19,990
outdated and as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could tell it</font>

498
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,710
doesn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a central server at all</font>

499
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:26,770
then I took a look at skyhook skyhook

500
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,610
what it does I think it's more

501
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:33,080
interactive and if you look on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

502
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:35,300
website they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do a they save you</font>

503
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,370
if we told you that here in this

504
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,139
location and you're not let us know so

505
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:42,919
kind of they're doing a dynamic thing

506
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:45,050
like community-based updates and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

507
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,500
have a sniffer trace that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

508
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:50,600
show so you guys follow sleep at once

509
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,930
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone i didn't have time</font>

510
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcr burn pcmcia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slot on my laptop</font>

511
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,550
and there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> service called wool</font>

512
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:04,070
tracker that does pretty much the same

513
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:06,050
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as skyhook but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so at least skyhook</font>

514
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,879
and worked record they have some cool

515
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,639
ideas things that probably I was going

516
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,760
to think a year from now if I still if I

517
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">was going to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this is</font>

518
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,900
even like from speed traps to other

519
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,169
stuff so let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw a speed trap</font>

520
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:24,740
you say I'm here press 1234 speed trap

521
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:26,540
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means 1 2 3 4 B speed trap it</font>

522
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">sends to their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> servers so everybody that</font>

523
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,470
is using those services going to get

524
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">notified saying go see you there's a</font>

525
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,240
speed trap watch out so that's kind of

526
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,850
cool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty sure that other stuff</font>

527
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,580
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to show up all the</font>

528
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:46,679
type of types of functionality

529
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:49,830
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

530
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm kind of concerned about on anissa</font>

531
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:56,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">tea that's the only major concern want</font>

532
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,460
to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know what my devices</font>

533
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,290
are sending out there some I saw some

534
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,090
products but out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US that you</font>

535
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,070
actually installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a laptop to say if</font>

536
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,169
your laptop was stolen first time

537
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">eternity powers up connects to the</font>

538
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:12,510
server not really effective because it

539
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">could just take the hard drive out and</font>

540
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:18,690
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again who created and things</font>

541
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,470
the databases that all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font>

542
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:26,160
use and is it possible to break this

543
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:28,830
system totally possible right now do we

544
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,840
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break or not from switching</font>

545
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,460
sides now forget let's say I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

546
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,179
a cell phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this type of service</font>

547
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:38,880
or with an iphone that says locate me I

548
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,030
don't know if I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that lots</font>

549
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,270
of people now know my dsl the bssid of

550
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:48,510
my router at home in my gateway at home

551
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:51,270
in the name of my network it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

552
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,400
but still so our way to break it would

553
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:56,340
be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple right just have</font>

554
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,640
everybody you could use or modify that

555
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:03,240
the bssid use the same bssid on all the

556
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:08,370
possible gateways in the planet so that

557
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:12,630
would break it not really effective some

558
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:14,820
stuff to show before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap up so how</font>

559
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,310
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works I wasn't going to show this</font>

560
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,540
and if it's really lame you just let me

561
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,330
know i'm not going to walk you through

562
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:24,389
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive photos and what matters</font>

563
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:27,149
here now i cannot see that either but

564
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the device does it sends so when</font>

565
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,800
you say where am I it sends a whole

566
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:34,440
bunch of probe request saying who's out

567
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,720
there and then based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the progra</font>

568
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,920
sponsors from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aps it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

569
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,210
somehow either as i said the microsoft

570
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,460
location finder what it does a

571
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,340
comparison internal table in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop</font>

572
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:50,090
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> services they just save some where</font>

573
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,620
and when they talk to the server in a

574
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,959
legal way

575
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,350
in an authorized way like your home

576
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,020
network then it changes that's the case

577
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,120
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph I for example when you take a</font>

578
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,639
picture it looks around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is exactly</font>

579
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,429
but sends a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of probe</font>

580
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,430
requests and then those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the probe</font>

581
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:15,860
responses somehow in the picture and the

582
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:19,320
metadata as John was saying his talk

583
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:24,449
goes to the JPEG and after talks to

584
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:26,340
ghosts server what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is does so</font>

585
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,890
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in the picture after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

586
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,800
goes through their server so they put

587
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,960
inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JPEG the place that'll work</font>

588
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:38,129
so you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's kind of</font>

589
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:41,100
interesting here those of us as I look

590
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:45,000

591
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:50,040
barely use this see there's a bssid kind

592
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,830
of thing here and everyone would

593
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:59,399
actually translates to well was at the
