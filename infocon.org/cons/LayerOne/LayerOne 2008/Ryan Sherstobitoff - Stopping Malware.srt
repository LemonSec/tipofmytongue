1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,519
okay our next speaker here is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryan</font>

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,340
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> stab it off with panda security on</font>

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:20,509
stopping malware I'll hand it over to

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,509
Ryan hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone hi can you hear me okay</font>

5
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:30,960
that's no good all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now all right</font>

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,668
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be super long</font>

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,180
but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

8
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:39,000
interesting concepts again my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,269
Ryan I come from panda<font color="#E5E5E5"> security which is</font>

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,969
an antivirus company and today we're

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to talk about some of the changes</font>

12
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,800
in the threat landscape we're also going

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,019
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about what the heck is is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt</font>

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,069
intelligence which happens to bleat be

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,829
the title of this slide so first of all

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,699
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how things have</font>

17
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,700
changed if any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you work directly with</font>

18
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,920
the the underground or with some hackers

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,439
you might know some of the information

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,659
I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the first slide</font>

21
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,949
here is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the growth</font>

22
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,159
of threats and this is director directly

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:22,770
proportional to the capabilities of

24
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:25,320
antivirus labs today so as you can see

25
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,270
here we have a tremendous growth from

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,729
two thousand six to two thousand seven

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,759
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about a strategy that's</font>

28
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,000
intentional from our you know

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,310
intelligence group within panda labs

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,439
we've been analyzing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,040
underground trends and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they've</font>

32
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,820
emerged over the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we we see</font>

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,270
that there's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in 2006</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there was</font>

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,048
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200,000 threats now prior to that</font>

35
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were seeing you know 50,000 60,000</font>

36
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,619
maybe for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entirety of the year so if</font>

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,600
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from an antivirus</font>

38
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:06,240
standpoint we had seen a change in

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,840
evolution and we'll talk about in a

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,430
minute why a volume of such threats is

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,349
even important to when

42
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,109
you're talking about security so when

43
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:20,010
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this you have in 2006</font>

44
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:23,140
200,000 threats what were those threats

45
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,689
consisting of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there were viruses</font>

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,078
they're worms there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojans what</font>

47
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:32,019
were their sole intention or orientation

48
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:34,060
when being released into the wild

49
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:36,370
because you know and all of you I'm sure

50
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,569
familiar with them the days of you know

51
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:43,120
Melissa and you know all those funny

52
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:45,280
blaster worms so those were we're all in

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,260
the past but I'm sure because

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,590
everybody's reading the news these days

55
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,269
it's all economical it's all hacking for

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,730
profits so this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about</font>

57
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:58,599
the underground<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

58
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,439
produced a secret FBI briefing document

59
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:05,649
that talked about Russian mafia becoming

60
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:08,620
quite involved in the hacker in a

61
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,169
malicious code ring so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

62
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,129
we have been analyzing several different

63
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:18,040
groups now back in 2006 some it's in

64
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:21,190
emerging into 2007 there's a team called

65
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,739
infected they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> created um I think</font>

66
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were one of the first groups to</font>

67
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:29,669
create you know a serious economical

68
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:32,340
damage to the financial community

69
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:35,379
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trojan it was called net hill</font>

70
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,879
limbo or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was half</font>

71
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:41,798
botnet and it was half sort of like you

72
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,388
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> banker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trojan what they're using</font>

73
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,040
for techniques were complex HTML

74
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,840
injection before it was keyloggers right

75
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we'll go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide</font>

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,590
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of going off track but</font>

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,709
i want everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand the</font>

78
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,379
techniques that they're using now which

79
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,359
are directly proportional to economic

80
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:04,720
fraud so before they would capture

81
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,939
people's passwords with key loggers well

82
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the banks came up with anti key</font>

83
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:12,310
logging technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well that worked</font>

84
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:15,250
quite effectively but now what they're

85
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing is um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could say man in</font>

86
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,289
the browser or ghost in the browser

87
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:23,880
attack they're inserting a BHO which is

88
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,979
injecting fields into a person's bank

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,010
login

90
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,410
process which an uneducated user would

91
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,420
not know so that you get like a username

92
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,090
password and all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's asking</font>

93
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">for social security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number horse asking</font>

94
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,570
for a pin so the common you know you

95
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,099
know mother grandmother you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know even my</font>

96
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,140
dad<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't even really know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

97
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">is oh okay I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this in its</font>

98
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,510
extra security but unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

99
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,790
hacker group is obtaining that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

100
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,560
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a serious threat where we have</font>

101
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">been having conversations with law</font>

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,060
enforcement in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a</font>

103
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,260
conversation with the assistant director

104
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,360
of the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> and his response was that</font>

105
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,880
they're becoming more clever they

106
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,050
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had something called Operation</font>

107
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,030
bot roast which was designed

108
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,570
specifically for shutting down these

109
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:19,340
huge bot rings that were half economic

110
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:21,110
fraud but back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this slide in 2007 you</font>

111
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,239
can see the threats had increased

112
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,140
exponentially we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,760
millions so who can guess the figure on

114
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,310
what is the percentage of those threats

115
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,289
that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly related to economic</font>

116
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:39,440
fraud anybody it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred percent</font>

117
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:42,260
but let's let's analyze this on a daily

118
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,260
basis so you have four to five thousand

119
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:48,770
brand new threats sixty percent of that

120
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,870
is oriented towards hacking for profit

121
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,210
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a bank or trojan</font>

122
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,110
we're talking about targeted threats

123
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:59,960
that result<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a data breach you must</font>

124
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,210
have seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hannaford right</font>

125
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,359
everybody heard of the retail chain up

126
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,169
north got their wonderful servers hacked

127
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,510
or you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard of the TJX max</font>

128
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,910
breach and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been blogging a lot</font>

129
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,580
about data breach prevention and it

130
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,650
comes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a common ology of what are</font>

131
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,469
they actually using in this process so

132
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,049
there's a theme in this case where

133
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,270
they're using traffic capturing Melissa

134
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,550
malicious software but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's targeted so</font>

135
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,700
when we go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> volume of malware</font>

136
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,210
the tactic is to see the industry with

137
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,710
so much noise that targeted threats go

138
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,299
under the radar so something that

139
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,690
x two or three hosts will never be

140
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,580
detected so we'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that</font>

141
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,980
the community are attempting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

142
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,340
this we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about in depth</font>

143
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,870
antivirus analysis here so we're going

144
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ways that were</font>

145
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:59,010

ratio of something when you're doing a

antiquated model which is av does not

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,719

00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,340
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more revolutionary</font>

172
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,960
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model where we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

173
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,940
the security as a service which we'll

174
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,409
get into some other stuff here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

175
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,690
look at the study here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

176
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,240
study<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did with over 1,200</font>

177
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:15,000
companies from around the world took

178
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">part so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> workstations were scanned</font>

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,840
using an audit service that at that time

180
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:24,450
we're working on prototypes to increase

181
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,260
detection capacity we had an objective

182
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:31,789
because we saw at the the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tail</font>

183
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,260
end of 2007 that there's a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

184
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:36,810
brand-new mauer so we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

185
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">out with something following</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a concept</font>

186
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,909
known as heard intelligence I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

187
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,550
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is yet but let's take a</font>

188
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,530
look at the criteria so the criteria of

189
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,709
this audit here is that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

190
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,709
test all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pcs that were part of this</font>

191
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,160
audit to see

192
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:57,040
okay we only considered a pc infected if

193
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,920
they had active processes or active

194
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,949
objects loaded in memory which were

195
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,620
related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virus trojan something or</font>

196
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,750
another then we also then tested with

197
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows security center whether or</font>

198
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">not protection was enabled disabled up</font>

199
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:16,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to date and therefore that was the</font>

200
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:21,220
criteria and the findings will come out

201
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the second here so the second thing</font>

202
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,210
is there's several different antivirus

203
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,860
vendors that were tested here because we

204
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,350
wanted to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's a common theme</font>

205
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,050
or pattern amongst virused based

206
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,390
offenses or signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> based offenses how</font>

207
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,339
we call it so across<font color="#E5E5E5"> this here there's</font>

208
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,210
40 different ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the purpose of the</font>

209
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,400
study we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to only rate the top</font>

210
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:45,130
leading vendors in the world as two

211
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,220
different infection ratios while

212
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,530
up-to-date defenses so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> only took into</font>

213
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,810
consideration pcs<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were scanned once</font>

214
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,819
were considered infected during that

215
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,520
period so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take into</font>

216
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,070
consideration<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leighton Trojans adware</font>

217
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,550
cookies by or anything like that we

218
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,370
wanted to find out specifically active

219
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,229
so active<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most dangerous threat</font>

220
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:14,440
because it's currently doing something

221
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:16,660
harmful to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC so the research</font>

222
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,210
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the end here I don't think</font>

223
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,920
will surprise a lot of people but we

224
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,450
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventy-two percent of the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">networks we're not talking about seventy</font>

two percent of the pcs we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

227
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,780
about seventy two percent of the

228
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:31,540
companies who were running top antivirus

229
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,300
products that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a signature</font>

230
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,880
based offenses we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,280
string string comparison as you would

233
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:45,969
find with when lab engineers reverse

234
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,410

<font color="#E5E5E5">two percent were infected there's</font>

236
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,329
obviously twenty-eight percent not

237
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,270
infected by the way this number has

238
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:59,290
increased this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

239
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:01,270
from mid-2007 what we've seen now is

240
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,459
there's around six thousand different

241
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,980
companies

242
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:08,130
who have been tested now and what we

243
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,160
found is an increase in certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of</font>

244
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:14,730
malware so themes of infections we have

245
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,620
seen is downloader<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojans chosens that</font>

go and download additional crime where

we've seen identity theft<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojans we</font>

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:43,050
posting by a colleague in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spain talking</font>

corporations actual infections found on

258
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:54,569
actual customers so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font>

259
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:58,469
evolution and trend but it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

260
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> viruses of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old days have pretty</font>

261
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,860
much phased out the the propagation

262
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,900
methods are no longer self-propagating

263
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,750
you don't see a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> worms these</font>

264
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,340
days that are self-propagating in a

265
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,780
large number yes there is occasional

266
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,350
worm infections here and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

267
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not the major news of the day</font>

268
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:22,020
what we're finding here is that web is a

269
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:25,469
common infection vector we're talking

270
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,780
about drive-by downloads so you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

271
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a site it's infected or lace but</font>

272
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,370
here's the interesting thing I was

273
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently talking and giving commentary</font>

274
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,320
on mass sequel injection so have you

275
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,090
guys heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the recent one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

276
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,310
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two weeks ago that did</font>

277
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,700
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> did about half</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a million sites</font>

278
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:46,469
generically by inserting a piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

279
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,830
JavaScript code which ultimately

280
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,560
resulted in attempted exploitation of

281
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:55,880
the endpoint so the question is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

282
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:00,089
you exploit a half a million servers

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,500
that quick and that rapidly without at

this query you could

news and load into a tool that would

292
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:22,620
reveal sites that could be potentially

293
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,990
attacked so then they would put this

crafted sequel statement and insert

295
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,519
these particular types of code so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

shows to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> example that even good</font>

legitimate websites today the good side

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the internet you don't have to walk</font>

299
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,540
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dark side to be infected so</font>

300
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,849
again looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the cybercrime</font>

301
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:44,579
underground the trends that we have our

302
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:49,050
researchers have seen is picking sites

303
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:51,628
that have less security in mind like

304
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,750
seasonal websites football sites stuff

305
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:57,089
like that where the person isn't like

306
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,939
extreme on security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they might have</font>

307
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:04,589
unsanitized sequel code so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

308
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:06,870
evolutions we have seen this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just a</font>

309
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:10,319
quick snapshot of different vendors who

310
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,910
were found infected yes we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

311
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:13,649
list here but that's with some other

312
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,740
type of product that didn't take

313
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,839
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of greater visibility but this</font>

314
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,149
is the show based on the study we had

315
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,730
conducted on there are some research

316
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:25,769
papers available i'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the blog</font>

317
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:30,060
at the end here which talks about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

318
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:32,939
of this commentary so now we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

319
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,099
know why is seventy-two percent networks

320
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:37,620
infected so what might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through</font>

321
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,839
your head is like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's great</font>

322
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,990
well how are they getting in how is it

323
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,730
by passing current defenses<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have and</font>

324
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,699
there's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

325
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,130
because it all goes back to the way that

326
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,899
traditional antivirus is design and

327
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,689
what's actually deployed in today's

328
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:58,259
world so who is familiar with host-based

329
00:14:54,689 --> 00:15:02,009
intrusion prevention that's good a lot

330
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:04,620
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so first of all we want to</font>

331
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at how are the bad guys getting in</font>

332
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,809
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a summarization of how</font>

333
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,430
they're actually getting in so first of

334
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:14,399
all we have what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called silent</font>

335
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:17,969
epidemics so that means this is silent

336
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:21,360
and unnoticed before it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was Fame and you</font>

337
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,300
know notoriety but if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

338
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,149
cybercriminal essentially you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go to</font>

339
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,529
an online<font color="#E5E5E5"> forum and purchase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trojans</font>

340
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:32,139
that have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service level agreement</font>

341
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:37,480
to it there's shopping carts there's a

342
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:39,730
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> business behind cybercrime that is</font>

343
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,149
actually fueling their economy today so

344
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,949
there may be you know hyped recession

345
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:47,290
with the United States but actually

346
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:49,300
there's a cybercrime underground where

347
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,240
there's a lot of Trojans worms and all

348
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,479
sorts of stuff being developed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

349
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">example they're actually designing and</font>

350
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,540
selling auto fishing kits where it'll

351
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:03,609
compromise a server for you build a

352
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">fishing site and then start targeting</font>

353
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,709
people so all this stuff can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

354
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:11,529
purchased next<font color="#E5E5E5"> door neighbors next door</font>

355
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:14,498
companies can pay 1200 bucks and become

356
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:17,920
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber criminal because it's now</font>

357
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:20,499
financially motivated everything pretty

358
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,079
much is a strive towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> profit so</font>

359
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:27,639
they'll do anything to bypass current

360
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,920
defenses firewalls IPS IDs antivirus and

361
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:31,990
we'll see in a minute exactly how they

362
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,800
are evading antivirus because it all

363
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,680
goes back to the the flawed model where

364
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,329
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrea Keith that Yankee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Group a</font>

365
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,969
leading firm was talking about that

366
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:45,309
vendors need to plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten times more</font>

367
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,350
than malware today because signature

368
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:49,959
based solutions are not effectively

369
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,970
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I actually have a diagram</font>

370
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we described it from really a</font>

371
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,459
top-down model so to summarize<font color="#E5E5E5"> this last</font>

372
00:16:55,509 --> 00:17:00,490
thing here the sophistication is changed

373
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:02,920
so targeted attacks so we had this

374
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,709
anti-fraud analysis service that found

375
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,250
this thing back in 2007 which ultimately

376
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,549
resulted in some 60 page document that

377
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">was delivered to the FBI and Interpol</font>

378
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:16,629
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the volume of what</font>

379
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,480
they're creating and adapting to

380
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,730
specific controls within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the financial</font>

381
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,280
community so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer a generic</font>

382
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:28,659
piece of Mauer it's really oriented

383
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:32,950
towards that specific company so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

384
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:34,740
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break into let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say the whole</font>

385
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:40,780
staples network what would I do first

386
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:42,760
well the theorem behind the TJX max

387
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,340
breach was somebody did a wet crack

388
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,310
at a local wireless and somehow did a

389
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,320
privilege escalation attack or elevation

390
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:53,010
attack on some of the credit card

391
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,450
processing servers so most likely

392
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,340
they're capable of exploiting a

393
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,740
vulnerability they may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not patched</font>

394
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,720
the systems well enough but once getting

395
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,510
on the network and exploiting the

396
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,600
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can then plant specifically</font>

397
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">design malware that will intercept and</font>

398
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,459
capture traffic relating to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

399
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:16,300
applications installed so you're not

400
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:18,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">really going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see too much about to</font>

401
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:22,330
some general keylogger or trojan on the

402
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:24,190
system this<font color="#E5E5E5"> other point here quality</font>

403
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,889
control for testing against vendor

404
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:30,190
signatures is also fairly important in

405
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:32,800
terms of the hacker success we see what

406
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,440
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is that they're loading</font>

407
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,080
all the engines including online engines

408
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,320
and testing to ensure that before they

409
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,990
resell their creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by passing</font>

410
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,149
signature defenses the last thing here

411
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,890
is virtual machine detection they can

412
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,260
obviously detect when they're inside a

413
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:53,260
virtual machine then take advantage of

414
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,720
the architecture of a virtual machine so

415
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,550
we're seeing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those there's a</font>

416
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,400
good percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to three</font>

417
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:03,310
percent of malware we see on a monthly

418
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,810
basis has some form of VM detection

419
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:09,909
included so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at the</font>

420
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,970
antivirus model here let's this is

421
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,460
basically a failing model so we describe

422
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,740
the traditional antivirus model<font color="#E5E5E5"> as top</font>

423
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">down the reason for top down is it</font>

424
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,260
describes the flowchart on what labs do

425
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,690
so if you want if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever wondered what</font>

426
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,640
it was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to be in an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> antivirus</font>

427
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,400
research lab at let's say a semantic

428
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">mcafee train or even panda security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

429
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what is currently being used the</font>

430
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,260
first step here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is malware samples</font>

431
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,850
received it goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab then the</font>

432
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,000
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step here is to create a signature</font>

433
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">or a rule now the problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

434
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,400
that they don't have automated

435
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:51,280
procedures that are able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to extract and</font>

436
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,970
create vaccinations on everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

437
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,860
comes in imagine if you do the math

438
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,470
and you have manual manpower behind all

439
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,169
of this you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000 threats per day</font>

440
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you let's say the common and average</font>

441
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,860
antivirus lab has maybe two hundred

442
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,840
engineers you're getting around a

443
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,990
sixty-five to seventy percent detection

444
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,389
ratio based on the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> and manpower</font>

445
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,660
to process everything so we're talking

446
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:18,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">about vaccination creation extracting</font>

447
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">mauer there is some cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where they're</font>

448
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,199
starting to automate the procedures but

449
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,730
the part<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're saying here is that</font>

450
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,430
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to correlate that</font>

451
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,520
information and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligent</font>

452
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:32,670
enough to then deliver a vaccination at

453
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,980
the end so at the end here we have the

454
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,710
update service which then distributes

455
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,360
the updates to all the nodes so looking

456
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,520
at the weaknesses here you have no

457
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,010
global<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat detection or intelligence</font>

458
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,840
so yes they do collect automatically

459
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,360
samples from the while there is some

460
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,980
degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> automation but what do we do</font>

461
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,419
with this afterwards how do we correlate

462
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,580
information that happened in China

463
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,800
versus what happened in United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

464
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,860
and use that effectively to produce a

465
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,930
vaccination without humans trying to

466
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,090
aggregate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the knowledge that's the weak</font>

467
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,740
point there some people might argue well

468
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,139
yeah antivirus labs have to have

469
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,000
automation involved yes they do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

470
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,970
do they do with the information that all

471
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,520
comes back in intelligently extracting

472
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,470
vaccinations back into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

473
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,780
is key here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> products don't</font>

474
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily benefit from all the</font>

475
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,570
processing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back end because</font>

476
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:27,480
architectural e-signature files the more

477
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:30,000
threats that are released in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wild</font>

478
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,060
the the greater the size so it ends up

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,210
becoming an impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the endpoint so if</font>

480
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:38,490
you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some 80 Meg signature file</font>

481
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:41,640
it ends up creating a heavy footprint

482
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,830
and with some of the you know antivirus

483
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,320
products out there there's definitely

484
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,689
you know concerns about that so how do

485
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,510
we produce something that's relatively

486
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,790
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> and light but still has detection</font>

487
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,470
capacity of a high<font color="#CCCCCC"> volume and that's</font>

488
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,260
where we'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt intelligence</font>

489
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,840
of putting everything from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint</font>

490
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,730
into the cloud and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> providing an md5</font>

491
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,659
hash analysis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk to you about</font>

492
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:07,320
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had coined</font>

493
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">nanotechnologies</font>

494
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,530
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that applies to the any of our</font>

495
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:15,000
space so running<font color="#E5E5E5"> down here is that back</font>

496
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:18,360
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the labs here there isn't a whole</font>

497
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,640
high degree of proactive protection in

498
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,340
here so we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know</font>

499
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,720
let's say sixty percent they can

500
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,209
automate but what about the really

501
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated rootkits and Packers down</font>

502
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:33,150
keep on and constantly evolve imagine

503
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Packers that are custom you don't have</font>

504
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:38,130
the decryption routine for that so how

505
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,439
do you deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have no</font>

506
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,240
way of understanding or getting access

507
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,280
to that you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of crime where as</font>

508
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,570
a service anybody well let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> server-side</font>

509
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,960
polymorphism we call this crime where as

510
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,929
a service instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having polymorphism</font>

511
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,880
occur on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the desktop we're talking about</font>

512
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:59,670
malware servers that automatically do

513
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,330
that they give malware on demand so

514
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,950
someone's infected with something it can

515
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,399
automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> morphin change its variant</font>

516
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:10,020
and deliver that down in a small binary

517
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,390
to the client so it can constantly

518
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,060
change a challenge here for antivirus

519
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,400
researchers is they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to</font>

520
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,490
the polymorphic engine right so they

521
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,770
have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what the logic is involved</font>

522
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:25,410
with that so you know endpoint

523
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:28,080
polymorphism or malware that is

524
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,790
polymorphism they use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Malaysian so a</font>

525
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Malaysian is the common technique that</font>

526
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">they use today to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect and</font>

527
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,399
analyze a polymorphic virus but if

528
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,830
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with something where the</font>

529
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,950
offspring is coming from a server and

530
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:46,439
it's all on on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> on-demand basis it</font>

531
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,880
makes it a lot more difficult so what

532
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,760
we're embracing here is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

533
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,990
educate companies they need to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

534
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,770
holistic approach we're talking about

535
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:01,890
proactive security using you know hips

536
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:05,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to detect the variance of the</font>

537
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">server-side polymorphism so what we're</font>

538
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:11,130
seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is that signatures if you</font>

539
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:13,620
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other common vendor site you</font>

540
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,020
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the average detection ratio</font>

541
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,209
in a DAT file it downloads today just

542
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,040
look at the daily updates is around a

543
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,330
quarter million to a half a million so

544
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,639
it's not entirely we're

545
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,439
selecting everything because we saw two

546
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,570
million threats last year why aren't

547
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,530
they on the signature file why are we

548
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,639
finding situations like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hannaford</font>

549
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,710
infected even though their antivirus

550
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,900
products is yes I'm update I'm working

551
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they got an update like two minutes</font>

552
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago there's obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a flaw it may be</font>

553
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,300
that the the labs are quite advanced but

554
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,360
they're not exactly extracting into the

555
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,810
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something that we</font>

556
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,090
had as a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

557
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">not like a super huge company we decided</font>

558
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,459
to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let's let's um you know</font>

559
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,820
reinvest them some of our revenue back

560
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,260
into you know solving this issue so

561
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,679
actually there's a research note written

562
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:11,490
by Andrew yeah Keith on some directions

563
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,900
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take to solve this problem so</font>

564
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,540
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is this a couple of other</font>

565
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">things in some cases a complete</font>

566
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:21,270
signature with inoculation can take

567
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks to deliver especially if it's very</font>

568
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:26,580
sophisticated like a rootkit that needs

569
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:30,480
to be deactivated so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

570
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,490
a general flow here so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font>

571
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">at what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is hurt intelligence this is</font>

572
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,090
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you do a search for</font>

573
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:38,340
Andrew yeah Keith hurt intelligence

574
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:41,459
you'll find some wonderful papers he

575
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,560
wrote about what do we do if malware

576
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,740
increases<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten times the amount it is</font>

577
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">today if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can barely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle four</font>

578
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,690
thousand samples per day we obviously

579
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,780
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a different direction so</font>

580
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is to create an automated</font>

581
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:59,970
data center of hundreds of servers and

582
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,520
the pillars here is watch acting watch

583
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:05,100
desired and act so the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

584
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,230
deploying sensors around the globe to

585
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,120
give a better visibility so we're

586
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,210
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about receiving information</font>

587
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">inquiries from sensors let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

588
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,550
10<font color="#E5E5E5"> million different endpoints part of a</font>

589
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:20,880
large interactive honeynet had the

590
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:23,280
capabilities of sending back suspicious

591
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,580
behavioral traits that's the first thing

592
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,100
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch the community at</font>

593
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">large and see the infection so it's kind</font>

594
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,399
of similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concepts of grid</font>

595
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,439
computing cloud computing

596
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,660
which we're taking intelligence from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

597
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">community so it's gathering data about</font>

598
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,420
malware and good<font color="#CCCCCC"> where so it's important</font>

599
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,880
to understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this model is</font>

600
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,520
to gather bad where traits as well as

601
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,110
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> word traits to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to correlate</font>

602
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,120
something new against a massive database

603
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:55,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">instead of doing it locally on an</font>

604
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,760
endpoint which does have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

605
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:01,310
resource consumption involved why don't

606
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,530
you just take it offline and provide it

607
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,929
in an automated fashion but with

608
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,330
hundreds and hundreds of servers second

609
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,970
part here is correlating all the

610
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:13,100
information it gathers so that's

611
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,590
important too so here's a good analogy I

612
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,300
give the press they on skate what does

613
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,980
that mean so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean by</font>

614
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,350
correlating and aggregating information

615
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:25,010
from the community so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing</font>

616
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:28,219
here is that let's imagine as part of

617
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybercrime evolution hackers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests</font>

618
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,140
their stuff they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just generate a</font>

619
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">virus variant and release it into the</font>

620
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,940
wild what they do is they tested against

621
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,490
all different vendors including any

622
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,290
online service so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> include are</font>

623
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,720
so what they would do is they test that

624
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,810
behavioral traits would be captured and

625
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,030
then relayed back to this herd

626
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:53,030
intelligence and stored as a record so

627
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:55,490
the very first creation would be stored

628
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,350
as you know the time in context when the

629
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,540
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> was running the suspicious</font>

630
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,600
characteristics and all of the

631
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:05,240
information necessary to give a detailed

632
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,949
description of that process we don't

633
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,990
know what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

634
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">any information to correlate it against</font>

635
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:16,460
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say he a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months later</font>

636
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,170
decides to create a vaccination<font color="#CCCCCC"> ohmori</font>

637
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,300
not a vaccination what creates a brand

638
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,610
new variant of this right but it all is

639
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,250
based on the original source code which

640
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:28,399
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these malware creators use</font>

641
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:31,100
source code<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other viruses so what it</font>

642
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,320
then creates is a new behavioral trait

643
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,629
which is then sent back up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud</font>

644
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,040
right so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff is stored</font>

645
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:41,300
historically so now it's capable of

646
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,060
correlating against a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> where list</font>

647
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:46,370
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 I guess you</font>

648
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">could say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 million different processes</font>

649
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,820
up

650
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,200
there and then correlating against the

651
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">mass of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad word list to make</font>

652
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,780
calculations as to whether or not this

653
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,270
has a high degree of danger potential

654
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,670
and honor on a research blog we actually

655
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:03,480
have a video that shows us taking

656
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:06,190
notepad and a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan and</font>

657
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,460
determining what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the highest degree</font>

658
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">of relation to Gail bot so we throw</font>

659
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,320
notepad in and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero percent</font>

660
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,500
relation to Gail bubble then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

661
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,560
variant that's probably 30 times removed

662
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:23,710
from Gail bot and throw it into the pile

663
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and with automated analysis and reverse</font>

00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:31,180
involved here it was capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

666
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:33,070
determining an 80% possibility that this

667
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,050
had some relation because it was

668
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,990
correlating the byte blocks within the

669
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:40,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> source code itself against all</font>

670
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,790
previous variations of Gail bought

671
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:45,189
collected so we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 20</font>

672
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">years of knowledge aggregated from all</font>

673
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,870
variants of viruses and being able to

674
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,370
correlate is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a family</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font>

some virus we saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years ago</font>

676
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,959
what they're using the same propagation

677
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:59,500
techniques but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different payload which</font>

678
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,470
is economically motivated so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

679
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is including loading ida pro in an</font>

00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:08,230
automated fashion to extract out certain

681
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,199
strings to create a detection routine so

682
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,830
this is all part of the process of

683
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,770
generating automated cleaning routines

684
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,899
the third part here is it acts so what

685
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:22,120
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it do it then answers the queries</font>

from the agents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are connected back</font>

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to her intelligence so when we're</font>

00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,750
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the definition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

689
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,270
nanotechnologies what is that what we're

690
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:34,270
talking about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:40,750

693
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,399
sending md5 hashes of every process in

<font color="#CCCCCC">the system back up their instant</font>

695
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,620
correlation then we get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer</font>

696
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,470
thing so it follows the phases of watch

00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:53,169
decide and act so someone doing you know

698

<font color="#E5E5E5">30 second pc scan which was part of the</font>

00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:59,779
would then be uploaded and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent back to</font>

701
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,239
the cloud whether we had any<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

706
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,570
brand new variants of<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware so we're</font>

707
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:18,710
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about greater visibility into</font>

708
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:21,189
the threat landscape so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

709
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,899
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how this works here so from a</font>

710
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,960

unknown program seen in the wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> this program and its context the</font>

00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:34,669
time it's running the relation of other

processes running at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time and</font>

715
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:39,190
certain characteristics that are

00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:43,039
extracted using heuristics technologies

717
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:46,419
so this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> is then sent back to</font>

718
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:49,219
the cloud and then exceptions or

719
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:51,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">vaccination rules are created and then</font>

720
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:54,080
informs all the other nodes so we're

721
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:56,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about automated aggregation of</font>

00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:12,918
detect 10 times more reliably than we

730
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:20,929
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down the the line of</font>

731
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:23,809
security as a service so no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:25,759
providing that files to people on a

<font color="#CCCCCC">constant feed or a constant subscription</font>

735
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:34,489

00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:36,619
instantaneous updates because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

737

scalable computing or grid computing

738
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:42,529
you're not reliant on the endpoints

739
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:45,559
performance overhead so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:48,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about relying on well is that PC</font>

741
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:50,059
powerful enough to contain millions of

742
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:53,089

743
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:55,940
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze some very advanced</font>

00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,299
collecting a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you can add</font>

more machines question

747
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:08,510
well if you're if you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,300
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> that take a direct advantage</font>

749
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,430
from this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolution that we're</font>

750
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,010
seeing here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditional antivirus</font>

751
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:18,050
products moving to a security as a

752
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:21,440

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the analysis and detection is done on</font>

755
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,360

756
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,580
locally because so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

757
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,280
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really causes the performance</font>

758
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:38,240
overhead is having the signature based

00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:40,040
defense the desktop<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewall dpi which</font>

760
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,710
is deep packet inspection hips

761
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,540
protection that on average takes ten to

762
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:47,030
fifteen percent overhead on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC</font>

763
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,980
taking that intelligence away from the

764
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,260
endpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> and moving it to a cloud</font>

765
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,600
because in most environments it's always

766
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,490
connected so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about moving</font>

767
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,709
everything back into the cloud and doing

00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,410
an automated analysis so all the

769
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,390
complicated routines that a virus

770
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,190
scanner would have to do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to</font>

00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,910
do now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a basic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signature</font>

772

within an infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">handle</font>

fine

777
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,749
no no what it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is let's say and and</font>

778
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:31,538
the actual endpoint security

779
00:34:28,748 --> 00:34:34,779
technologies are not advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a point</font>

00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of being always on always connected so</font>

781
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:38,889
what we're talking about here is imagine

782
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,239
if you're able to do and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

783
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:43,149
future<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not something that's</font>

784
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,649
present right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now because I haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

785
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:47,558
it with any other company we're not

786
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,839
there ourselves as banda but what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

787
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:52,119
is having the ability to interact in

788
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,429
real time without creating a large

789
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,099
amount of network traffic back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

790
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:59,289
cloud so we can instantaneously identify

791
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:01,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we have a suspicious file can we</font>

792
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:04,749
send the md5 to a middleware server that

793
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:06,759
does batch processing right so you would

794
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:09,339
at least get extraction from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud</font>

795
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:11,349
on a daily basis which means millions of

796
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:13,150
threats so if there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new then</font>

797
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:14,680
it would then inform that note and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

798
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,630
hey node we just found out from the

799
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,640
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users that there's a</font>

800
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">brand-new piece of malware targeting you</font>

801
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,920
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought I would let you know so</font>

802
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:26,680
that's kind of where it stands today the

803
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,049
future really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is having a file level</font>

804
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,960
system interceptor that has the

805
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:34,140
capabilities of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time analysis</font>

806
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,880
on each process without sucking up the

807
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,440
network bandwidth and interacting back

808
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,019
and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the cloud during the</font>

809
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,359
entire antivirus scan and that's

810
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously a challenge because one you</font>

811
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to have a huge amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

812
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:49,480
chatter back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so somehow</font>

813
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:51,249
architectural<font color="#CCCCCC"> II it has to be done</font>

814
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,950
through a middleware server and then

815
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:55,930
batch processing done so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

816
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,689
difficult thing to do we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

817
00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:01,930
yet but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the platform to be able to</font>

818
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:05,019
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is there right data center</font>

819
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:07,868
of 500 servers capable of analyzing

820
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:10,629
everything that comes in and producing

821
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:14,349
vaccinations with maybe four percent of

822
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:17,069
it requiring human involvement so that's

823
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:17,069
kind of where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at now</font>

824
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:23,410
so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly some statistics here</font>

825
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,140
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell you because we actually</font>

826
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:29,859
had deployed a herd intelligence model

827
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:31,810
back in late two thousand six in limited

828
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:34,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">prototypes so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is exactly the data</font>

829
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:36,670
processing capabilities of hurt

830
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:38,800
intelligence so currently to date four

831
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,859
million pcs are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being monitored around</font>

a hundred million programs analyzed

836
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:56,920
that's bad we're good we're over 340

million correlations perform the key

838
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,380
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that doing the automated</font>

correlation the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced heuristics the</font>

840
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,420
static unpacking all of that you can't

841
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:09,940
do in real time on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

842
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:12,010
huge performance overhead because

843
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-five percent of malware today is</font>

844
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,660
packed forty percent is custom where

845
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:18,910
it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercially available packed</font>

846
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,740
routine so we have to create generic

847
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:25,379
unpacking routines and trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

848
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,379
at the end point is difficult yeah I

849
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:35,109
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:37,259
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that yeah so what was the</font>

851
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:37,259
question

852
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:47,890
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't heard of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I don't</font>

853
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:51,670
work directly with the research lab so

854
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:55,100
some my colleagues are probably involved

855
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:57,830
in you know generic unpacking but we are

856
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:02,330
developing generic and packing routines

857
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:05,000
we always participate in various virus

858
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:08,120
conferences on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical director at</font>

859
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,830
panda labs is always going in the

860
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:15,140
community as well sorry I'm he was

861
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,890
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool from offensive</font>

862
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,240
computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's called saffron</font>

863
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:23,420
it's it's basically talking about

864
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,540
generic and packing so generic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

865
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">packing is definitely a challenge and</font>

866
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,890
it's all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting it efficiently</font>

867
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,290
into products so if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

868
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,839
generic unpacking routine it's

869
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:39,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take into</font>

870
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,750
consideration so just a quick last

871
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:48,290
couple of stats here um how am I on the

872
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:51,200
time oh wow that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time left so</font>

873
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:54,650
last couple things here is over 340

874
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,649
million correlations performed over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

875
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,390
billion records in the database so this

876
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,400
is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of malware</font>

877
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:04,220
that has been collected over the years

878
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,950
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now in the database so the last</font>

879
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">point here is these are the stats that I</font>

880
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:12,680
had received from<font color="#E5E5E5"> panda labs from last</font>

881
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:15,290
year 94.4 percent of all malware

882
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,690
detected in 2007 comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt</font>

883
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,570
intelligence so we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

884
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,860
was what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was automatically classified</font>

885
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:24,530
obviously there's a percentage that had

886
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,300
to be classified<font color="#E5E5E5"> with human effort</font>

887
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,850
because some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complex</font>

888
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:34,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server-side polymorphism the root</font>

889
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:37,160
kits etc so the last thing here is a new

890
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,510
but necessary layer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fence so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

891
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,960
of the benefits here is the global

892
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:45,290
visibility into the threat landscape

893
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,720
reducing reaction time on demand audits

894
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:50,120
of virtualized networks that was kind of

895
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,310
left in there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was kind of a</font>

896
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,279
sly taking here from virtualization

897
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:56,460
conference I

898
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,400
at locating unnoticed infection points

899
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,610

901

902
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,490
to detect malware on lesser pcs<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:16,200
currently with you know the manual

904

905
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,149
that's all i have for you today I know I

906
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,560
I gave a huge data dump here and a lot

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:47,140
sorry I'm not familiar with the the race

00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:47,140
20<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

924
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,410
based on

925
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,810
well I could tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one thing here is</font>

926
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,700
it all goes back to the testing

927
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:19,480
standards here that are currently being

928
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:21,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the market</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today to rate the</font>

929
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,370
effectiveness so obviously taking

930
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,490
currently known viruses and passing it

931
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:29,529
through signature based offenses and

932
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:30,970
essentially saying okay well you missed

933
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:34,300
this virus so therefore you're not

934
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:38,140
effective so I don't know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> details of</font>

935
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:40,270
this challenge but essentially testing

936
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,640
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signature but testing the</font>

937
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:45,210
proactive side as well testing different

938
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,770
measures of different antivirus products

939
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,960
so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just signature basis whether or</font>

940
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:53,080
not we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find this polymorphic virus</font>

941
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,720
with a signature also can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find it</font>

942
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,430
with her istics can we find it with you

943
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,740
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> hips space solutions so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to</font>

944
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:02,560
be taken into consideration<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire</font>

945
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:10,479
holistic model not just a portion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

946
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:12,970
vendors product now i would i<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say</font>

947
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:17,260
so beating a dead horse because we know

948
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:20,549
that signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> based defenses or only as</font>

949
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,780
good as being able to provide the

950
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:25,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">vaccination and detection routine so</font>

951
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,900
because a lot of it today is not

952
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:31,060
automated and it's quite manual it in it

953
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,090
results in not a high number of

954
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,950
detections so i would say an appropriate

955
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:38,680
test would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be let's take into</font>

956
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,890
consideration you know generic and

957
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,589
packing let's take into consideration

958
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:45,850
behavioral analysis behavioral blocking

959
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:49,240
system heuristics all of those things

960
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:51,009
need to be used when effectively testing

961
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,930
because that doesn't give a real reality

962
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:55,480
of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we could stop that</font>

963
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:58,270
virus so it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be included on our</font>

964
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,510
signature but we sure as hell can detect

965
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:03,490
it using other means so that's my

966
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:07,140
response you know too that even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I</font>

967
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,140
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea about the details</font>

968
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,820
any other questions

969
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,660
that would be one reason with the

970
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:29,810
virtual machine detection another one is

971
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">too I haven't seen specifically a sample</font>

972
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:35,200
that does this but to adapt to knowing

973
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:37,640
it's in a virtual environment therefore

974
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,609
exploiting maybe the hypervisor but

975
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,730
that's kind of really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trend we</font>

976
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:45,830
would see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of vm detection but</font>

977
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:49,790
it's usually meant to evade from being

978
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:52,069
put into a sandbox or a honey pot that's

979
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:53,330
using virtualization so it's able to

980
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">then say you know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to run</font>

981
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:57,650
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's not my target so</font>

982
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,420
that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VM detection but</font>

983
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,580
obviously there if they can detect that

984
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,740
they're in a vm they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then detect and</font>

985
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:12,259
how to best take advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

986
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:14,330
situation so question well I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

987
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">you this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pana security has already</font>

991
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:26,000
since honest security it's really how

in real time with the cloud but we have

997
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:40,340
deployed several different technologies

998
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:42,230
one was what we call nano scan where I

999
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,630
said where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could scan a PC in 30</font>

1000
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:47,030
seconds and it would take all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> md5</font>

1001
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:49,400
hashes and send that<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the cloud</font>

1002
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,960
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlation some other products some</font>

1003
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,300
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know especially one that we're</font>

1004
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,450
announcing on Monday which is a security

1005
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,570
as a service product does take advantage

1006
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:01,430
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud but it is extracting</font>

1007
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:03,740
information in terms of a mega<font color="#CCCCCC"> PAP sig</font>

1008
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,899
is what we call it which then applies to

1009
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:09,279
the end point but true interaction and

1010
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:12,350
true real-time is yet to come where

1011
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,640
there's a brand new process executing

1012
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,470
and we're able to analyze<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in real</font>

00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:20,810
obviously architectural considerations

1015
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:25,220
is is that going to create a hit on the

1016
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">pc or performance overhead especially if</font>

1017
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,000
network traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth</font>

1018
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,480
so that's something that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1019
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,200
design that

1020
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,200
takes into consideration those issues

1021
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,200
yeah

1022
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,130
superbird all

1023
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,879
Chris

1024
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:18,240
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good question yeah</font>

1025
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:20,850
but if you're if you're specifically

1026
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,680
signing communications or validating

1027
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,290
them where it's kind of like a one-way

1028
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,140
hash of what's actually being sent back

1029
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,330
to the cloud then the answers cannot be

1030
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:33,750
spoof so that was something included in

1031
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:35,819
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nano scan product which you know</font>

1032
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:38,220
sent one way hashes of the information

1033
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to the cloud so wasn't able to</font>

1034
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,580
intercept or impersonate and there's

1035
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:44,460
there's a whole technical document on

1036
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,750
exactly how that was achieved but yes

1037
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,160
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to have to be some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

1038
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,170
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> included at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

1039
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,799
point but guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not doing</font>

1040
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:55,230
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our scanning dpi or behavioral</font>

1041
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,240
analysis or all this other stuff that's

1042
00:47:55,230 --> 00:48:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">a minimal overhead so if you're just</font>

1043
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,790
solely focusing on ensuring that the

1044
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,669
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> stream is encrypted with let's say</font>

1045
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:08,279
SSL<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one-way hash is then it doesn't</font>

1046
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,050
really you know put a lot of overhead

1047
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,550
but if you got all the other bloated

1048
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:14,480
technologies on there too then yes you

1049
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:18,300
design considerations need to be

1050
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,800
implemented around that any other

1051
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:25,080
questions I think I ran out of my time

1052
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:26,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I'll be around for the</font>

1053
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:30,710
rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day if you have any other</font>

1054
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,710
further questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thank you</font>
