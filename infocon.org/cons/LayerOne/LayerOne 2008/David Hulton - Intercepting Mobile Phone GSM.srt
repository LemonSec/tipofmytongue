hacking talk that he gave not too

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,390
terribly long ago which if you guys

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I totally recommend paying close</font>

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,629
attention to this one it's pretty

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:14,420
freaking cool go ahead and let you get

22

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,390
the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that straw</font>

mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> his talk earlier actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,869

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">through my slides and going like oh shit</font>

29

30
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,720
move things around and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do a</font>

31
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,169
real intro and and so so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my real</font>

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,200
intro my name is david Holton obviously

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:45,500
you've already heard an intro oh hey hey

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:49,439
back there how's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> going queeg so um</font>

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,450
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a like the chairman for torque</font>

36
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,320
on I also do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff with fpgas</font>

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,299
if you guys know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is and and</font>

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,270
mostly specifically crypto cracking with

39
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">fpgas one of the interesting projects</font>

40
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,729
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been working on recently is</font>

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,598
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpgas to crack gsm so first of all</font>

42
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,000
there's a few things i'm going to cover

43
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,510
and before<font color="#E5E5E5"> i even cover the stuff</font>

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,550
who knows what GSN is anyway yeah who

45
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:24,590
uses gsm who uses something that isn't

46
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,970
gsm like cdma sprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool so i'm</font>

47
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,840
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

48
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,340
gsm works<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually I didn't do any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,980
the protocol stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just kind of</font>

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,780
have a high<font color="#E5E5E5"> level view of the stuff but</font>

51
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,239
I did do all the of the cracking a5

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,420
stuff so any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that feel free</font>

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hammering with them and I'm going to</font>

54
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">show you some of the different projects</font>

55
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:49,310
we've been working on for actually

56
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:52,730
receiving gsm signals so first of all

57
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,770
gsm is widely deployed ATT tmobile

58
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,560
pretty much like almost all the carriers

59
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,000
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world use it aside from you know</font>

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,040
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple carriers here and a couple</font>

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,380
carriers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> india</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that use cdma and and</font>

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,900
so it's it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hugely widely</font>

63
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,970
deployed system out there and they use a

64
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of standard sets of algorithms</font>

65
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,220
for doing their<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication and their</font>

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,170
encryption namely a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 38 for</font>

67
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,510
authentication and a five for encryption

68
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cover that a bit more in</font>

69
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:29,359
just a little bit so um his ode here's a

70
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,070
big graph which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Strom would probably say</font>

71
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,040
is inappropriate for a talk like this

72
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,500
but but really all you need to focus on

73
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that there's this huge infrastructure</font>

74
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,060
here on this side<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's your cell</font>

75
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,769
phone here's these towers and then

76
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,920
basically it kind of goes back and

77
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,470
routes out to you know like to be able

78
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,149
to call people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like that and</font>

79
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,250
we really only focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this portion</font>

80
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,350
right here because we don't really have

81
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,970
easy access to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff back here</font>

82
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,609
aside from breaking into a telco or

83
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:05,480
something like that so so we're gonna

84
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:08,510
focus on this what's that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you guys</font>

85
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,929
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a BTS looks like yeah this is</font>

86
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,890
an example

87
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:18,079
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example there are</font>

88
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:20,668
also BTS does it look like this yeah

89
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:26,100
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually grow like normal</font>

90
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:29,359
trees but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some striking</font>

91
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,440
similarities between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two I guess so</font>

92
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah they have deployed some of these</font>

93
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a little tricky you know you</font>

94
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,699
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> full bars on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your cell phone and you</font>

95
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,650
look around and try to see where the

96
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,550
base station is and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be</font>

97
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,909
hiding right<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind you you never know</font>

98
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:49,800
so in summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> a GSM is old it's been</font>

99
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:51,599
around for decades gsm is big it's you

100
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">know like the most widely deployed cell</font>

101
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,960
phone standard out there and there's

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,159
base stations all over the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's over two million</font>

104
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,840
subscribers which makes it comparable to

105
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:05,430
like the internet you know in size of

106
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,560
devices and network and and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

107
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,930
up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we haven't actually</font>

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,270
been able to you know start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

109
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,490
these devices you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we had all</font>

110
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,500
these ways you know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create sagas</font>

111
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,930
we can do port scans of you know systems

112
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,729
and stuff like that but but until now

113
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,280
it's been very obscure<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know how</font>

114
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cell phone all</font>

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,250
that stuff has been really closed and

116
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,289
people don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

117
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,470
stuff so we wanted to look into this and

118
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:35,430
see you know like what what's going on

119
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:37,409
on this huge network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of</font>

120
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,680
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking at we</font>

121
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:42,180
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nokia 3310 which is actually a</font>

122
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,270
really cheap phone you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> these on</font>

123
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,979
ebay for like five dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

124
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,289
that Steve the other guy give this

125
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,150
presentation with about his for one

126
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:53,340
dollar and paid like six dollars for

127
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,919
shipping or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

128
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,099
they're very cheap you just get a debug

129
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,289
cable you hook it up to your pc and you

130
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,759
can we have software on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our website</font>

131
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,500
where you can just start watching your

132
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,300
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic so you can see all the</font>

133
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,180
packets that get sent to and from your

134
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,330
phone so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really useful for</font>

135
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,650
debugging purposes and and it's just a

136
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">really cheap way to start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

137
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,090
stuff if you actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see other</font>

138
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,820
people's traffic we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with</font>

139
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">the u.s. RP the new radio project to be</font>

140
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,990
guys sort of that before

141
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,720
yeah so it's a it's a software-defined

142
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:31,080
radio you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy the system that looks like</font>

143
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this over here and it costs you about I</font>

144
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,800
think there are about six hundred

145
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,449
dollars right now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a front</font>

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,620
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it and stuff like that until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

147
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe cost you about nine hundred</font>

148
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,330
dollars for a decent antenna and full

149
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,370
set up and you wrote our software on

150
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,370
there and you can basically just start

151
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,389
you know doing whatever sort of

152
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,460
software-defined radio stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

153
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,570
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

154
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,120
project little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next</font>

155
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,099
slide but there's also a couple other

156
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,580
different ways of intercepting gsm

157
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,139
traffic there's these omap development

158
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,930
kits which is basically the development

159
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,430
kits that people use for like developing

160
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,320
their actual cell phones and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

161
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,850
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these into debug mode you can you</font>

162
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,500
know have afford you the packets there's

163
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,360
all sorts of cool debugging things you

164
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,130
can do with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that those</font>

165
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,570
currently costs about ten thousand

166
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,449
dollars they're a little bit expensive

167
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,919
and then on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> really high end of</font>

168
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">things there's commercial interceptors</font>

169
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,240
that like law enforcement and other

170
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:28,340
people use and these can cost a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">money I'll go into that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a little bit</font>

172
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,500
so talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the guinea radio</font>

173
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,810
project the support<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly works it's</font>

174
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,060
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have demo to hear but</font>

175
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been having some trouble with with</font>

176
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,190
going through airports with our new

177
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:46,229
radios Steve my co-presenter actually

178
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,120
got stopped in in the UK when he was

179
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,639
traveling to a conference divided to

180
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,010
demo the stuff and basically the customs

181
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,099
like confiscated is his new radio and

182
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,599
his cell phone they were kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of gave it</font>

183
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to him after he got back to the UK</font>

184
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,460
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rude us a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

185
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,440
paranoid about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff now but if you</font>

186
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,698
have it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a usrp you can</font>

187
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,130
download the software and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you</font>

188
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,349
can check out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the stuff essentially</font>

189
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:14,010
the software lets you run wireshark on

190
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:16,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">GSM so you tune in the channel it</font>

191
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,180
creates basically a fake network device

192
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,340
you fire up wireshark on the network

193
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,889
device and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the GSM</font>

194
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,659
packets going on right now it only

195
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,370
supports the slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> association channel</font>

196
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,410
but this still means that you can see

197
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,820
like all the cell phones that are

198
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,020
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the base station sending</font>

199
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,328
out their broadcasts and stuff like that

200
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,350
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see calls but you can</font>

201
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:38,189
see you know people associating

202
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:41,680
you can also do like location<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking</font>

203
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:44,440
if you know somebody's ID on the network

204
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,030
you can see like you know how close<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

205
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,080
are to different base stations there's

206
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,550
lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things you can do with</font>

207
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,810
this in order to do other more advanced

208
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,849
things like actually monitoring calls

209
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,699
and SMS is there's a couple of things

210
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,370
we've been working on we're trying to

211
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,370
implement a rotor be error correction

212
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,810
stuff and we've got mostly working but

213
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,550
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't gone working in real time yet</font>

214
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,119
so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of optimization that</font>

215
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be done with that then there's</font>

216
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,250
also this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with channel hopping</font>

217
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:17,079
that we we found out that gsm has this

218
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,040
optional channel hopping thing that they

219
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,120
do where when you place a call they will

220
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,849
for every frame they will hop to a

221
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,470
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel and and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

222
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,880
really difficult because now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

223
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,860
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> messing around with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usrp</font>

224
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">firmware and setting it to you know</font>

225
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,710
follow that that hopping sequence in

226
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,939
order to capture everything so that's

227
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely possible with the hardware</font>

228
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,340
but you know it requires some time to

229
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,380
get all that stuff to work and then of

230
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,490
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's encryption that secures</font>

231
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,290
this whole thing so we have to get

232
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,400
around that and that's mostly what I'm

233
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,280
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be focusing on later on the</font>

234
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,110
stock but with the first few points here

235
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,579
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for help if anybody here</font>

236
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,040
is interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on RF stuff</font>

237
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,110
check out our website send us an email

238
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,000
we're looking for for people to help out

239
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:05,020
with with optimizations and things like

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,240
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> where are some examples of some</font>

241
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,740
frames that we've actually seen from the

242
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,230
US are PE and you can also get these

243
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:15,310
from the 3310 the really cheap cell

244
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone this is a this is spit out from a</font>

245
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,989
program you can download from our

246
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,140
website this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really interesting right</font>

247
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,640
here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

248
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,350
subscriber identity identifier in the

249
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,060
network which according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec is</font>

250
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,470
never supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sent over the</font>

251
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,270
network in plain text because this is

252
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,450
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your user ID in the</font>

253
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,670
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know this number I know</font>

254
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,250
you know like exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you are on</font>

255
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network and so if I was trying to</font>

256
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,290
track you know like where are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you right</font>

257
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,910
now I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know look for your</font>

258
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,410
MZ on the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

259
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,600
triangulate where you are based on the

260
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,089
base stations and stuff and so there's a

261
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of interesting implications for this</font>

262
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:56,890
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do create a temporary</font>

263
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier on the network which they're</font>

264
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,330
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use but but this is this is</font>

265
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,939
a really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we found thing</font>

266
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:06,790
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> found out with the whole system</font>

267
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,800
which makes it seem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know people</font>

268
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,589
could be easily tracking other people

269
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,349
without even having to break encryption

270
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:16,090
and and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also these bits</font>

271
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,380
that tell you which algorithms are

272
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,330
actually available on the network when

273
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,420
you authenticate and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

274
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,550
interesting because with this you can

275
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,620
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like the base station</font>

276
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,650
advertises what algorithms it supports

277
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,100
and then you can also you know advertise

278
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,060
what algorithm to support so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

279
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,610
kind of how the man in the middle

280
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,170
attacks work you you can set up a fake

281
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,850
base station somebody connects to your

282
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,729
fake base station you negotiate them

283
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,230
down to no encryption and and so there's

284
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,530
there's all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways to</font>

285
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:54,060
exploit stuff like that assuming you

286
00:11:47,530 --> 00:12:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">have like you know oh go ahead what's up</font>

287
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:03,520
um I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not entirely sure oh sorry thanks</font>

288
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,520
from the question was is viewing this

289
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,880
data entirely legal and my answer was

290
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not entirely sure so what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that uh</font>

291
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:18,390
yeah well I mean listening on this

292
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,390
frequency is kind of technically illegal

293
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,560
yeah but I mean it's also iffy if you

294
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,910
have a debug cable hooked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to your</font>

295
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,280
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watching your own</font>

296
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,390
you know stuff coming off your phone it

297
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,189
isn't like you have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own scanner</font>

298
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's listening on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> frequency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

299
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:38,280
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you want to</font>

300
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">interpret the laws with it but yeah yeah</font>

301
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:46,900
so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what now various hardware will</font>

302
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:49,120
definitely capture traffic and it turns

303
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,370
out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some base stations we've seen</font>

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,710
actually send SMS is unencrypted this is

305
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,780
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we saw with some</font>

306
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,840
base stations up in Seattle we're not

307
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,829
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> how how much this</font>

308
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,240
like other networks and stuff but um

309
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,700
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we do about capturing real</font>

310
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,440
conversations it turns out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

311
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,510
countries don't actually use any

312
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,000
encryption at all and some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them use</font>

313
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,710
this weaker standard called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 52 which</font>

314
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,300
is mostly given to like the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

315
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,690
unstable countries that you know we want

316
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to watch after most of the real</font>

317
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:24,000
countries you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know get a 5-1 not</font>

318
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:27,030
implying that real country or anything

319
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,960
but but like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. uses a</font>

320
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">51 and and so that's that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

321
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,740
of like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Holy Grail the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole thing</font>

322
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,660
you know that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want to</font>

323
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,830
go after because that's what most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

324
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,819
people use and that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

325
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:44,850
interesting difficult one to attack so

326
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at our security here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on there</font>

327
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,570
there isn't really any security on the

328
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,099
internal network like you you can plug

329
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,200
in and start just like sniffing any

330
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,790
traffic and stuff but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

331
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,300
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to break into the into</font>

332
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,349
the service provider so we've already

333
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,810
established that there isn't really any

334
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,790
security on that side so that leaves oh

335
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:07,229
well obviously there's security over the

336
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:09,030
air but this is poem so there isn't

337
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,010
really any security at all on GSM

338
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:16,650
anymore which I'll cover in a little bit

339
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,450
so for a commercial interception there's

340
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,790
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different options</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are very</font>

341
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:24,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive that are available you can</font>

342
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:26,280
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go just search for like gsm</font>

343
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:30,329
interception on google and you'll see a

344
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,400
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting devices pop up they</font>

345
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,440
range we've contacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font>

346
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">places</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> range from like 70,000</font>

347
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,220
to half a million dollars depending on

348
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,150
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many channels you want to</font>

349
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,530
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to at a time etc and and this is</font>

350
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,530
this is with active equipment that will

351
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:48,510
actually create a fake base station

352
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,819
perform a man-in-the-middle attack on a

353
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,980
5-1 and then you know let you listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

354
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,390
stuff but but all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

355
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,090
unreliable you have to be really close

356
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,580
to the target like I think it's within

357
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,740
about a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> meters or 300 meters or</font>

358
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,510
something like that because you actually

359
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,010
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a signal that will</font>

360
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,240
overpower the other base stations in the

361
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,920
area and make them connect to you

362
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,029
and then you for their traffic along and

363
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,000
so so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there's stuff out there</font>

364
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:17,189
that will currently do this but it's

365
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,990
it's kind of inconvenient what we were

366
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,760
really aiming for is a passive attack

367
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,930
and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually stuff out there</font>

368
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,130
that currently exists for about a

369
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,449
million dollars which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

370
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:29,430
expensive obviously and but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

371
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,220
passive equipment you know like right

372
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,260
now I can be up to 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> miles away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

373
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,060
base station and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like a</font>

374
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,520
cell phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation if its line of</font>

375
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,560
sight with passive equipment you know

376
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,970
somebody can be anywhere within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

377
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,439
range of the base station and your cell

378
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,930
phone and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

379
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,670
stuff and so you know like I could just

380
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">be sitting at home I'm a couch you know</font>

381
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,060
listening to someone's conversation on

382
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other side of the city and so we</font>

383
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want to do the lazy attack you</font>

384
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,649
know and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just like lounge</font>

385
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:00,930
around instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having to chase after</font>

386
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:04,500
people and stuff so so yeah there's a

387
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:06,120
three algorithms a 50 a 52 and a 51 and

388
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,220
all of these were actually reverse

389
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:13,860
engineered and broken back in 1998 and

390
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,329
actually the lot of the attacks on them

391
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,279
were actually published before they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

392
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:18,750
even leaked<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they started figuring</font>

393
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,579
out some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and then people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

394
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,170
writing all these papers on like ways to

395
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,550
break it and then eventually they

396
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,770
actually found out you know what the

397
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,510
algorithms were and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know even</font>

398
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">more papers came out on like flaws and</font>

399
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:33,480
and stuff so um all these papers about

400
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,060
it being broken we're mostly academic

401
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:40,110
they didn't really apply to like the

402
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:42,180
real world like if you know exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

403
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,190
the audio that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going across the</font>

404
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,229
conversation for you know like three

405
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,630
minutes then you could crack it in like

406
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,339
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months you know and</font>

407
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,990
stuff like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's kind of</font>

408
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,779
stupid stuff like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all</font>

409
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,010
in 1998 and so now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

410
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,420
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the future we can do way better</font>

411
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to cover that in a little</font>

412
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,670
bit so a lot of these algorithms are

413
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,630
proprietary and so they had to be

414
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:09,000
reverse engineered and and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

415
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned before like without breaking</font>

416
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,809
any encryption at all you can still you

417
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,250
know track people and all that sort of

418
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:17,059
stuff just because all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information</font>

419
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,059
is leaked and

420
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,330
initially the key was actually

421
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:23,069
artificially weekend they set the last

422
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:25,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten bits of the key to zeros and then</font>

423
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,520
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> reverse engineered and found that</font>

424
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">out then they're like oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay our bad</font>

425
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,780
you know we'll fix that will throw all

426
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,890
the key bits in there and but it just

427
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,620
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's lots of little things</font>

428
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:39,690
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the whole process that that</font>

429
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:43,620
make it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fishy like so so</font>

430
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:47,520
anyway there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of key recovery</font>

431
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,169
systems available for a 52 a 51 there

432
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,900
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very few that can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

433
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:56,610
it passively another interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

434
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been starting to work on with</font>

435
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:04,320
the if you check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the THC wiki is sim</font>

436
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,510
toolkit how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got their</font>

437
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,290
sim in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last like say three years</font>

438
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:12,750
like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people here so some of you</font>

439
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,570
have pretty pretty new sims like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32</font>

440
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">k or 64</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> K or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that um a</font>

441
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:21,510
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these sims actually have a java</font>

442
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,670
virtual machine running on them and if

443
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,220
you actually check out the specification

444
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,990
the operator like t-mobile or singular

445
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,090
whatever it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually send silent</font>

446
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,520
updates to your SIM card and execute

447
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,169
whatever code that they want and there's

448
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,540
a full API for this stuff that's very

449
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:42,180
interesting like like call control

450
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,220
binary updates you can one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

451
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">found is that you could actually upload</font>

452
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,050
a program to it wear whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make a</font>

453
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,520
phone call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also calls another number</font>

454
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,100
and forward your conversation to that

455
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,790
and so there's all sorts of interesting

456
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,439
interception things that can actually be

457
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,740
done you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just on the software that</font>

458
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">runs on your SIM card so we're starting</font>

459
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to develop for the SIM cards and trying</font>

460
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,439
to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what sort of things happen</font>

461
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,720
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but very interesting stuff and</font>

462
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,830
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have you</font>

463
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,940
know a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer inside of your</font>

464
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">sim cards so anyway summary about the</font>

465
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,860
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that really there there's</font>

466
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:20,820
any real security there's there's a lot

467
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,310
of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of well we we consider</font>

468
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,960
snake oil and the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing but um we</font>

469
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:32,178
had basically there isn't really any so

470
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:36,289
to go over cracking a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 51 we have a cell</font>

471
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:39,169
phone like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these and a base</font>

472
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:41,360
station and on your SIM card there's a

473
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:44,390
sink hole de ki which is your actual

474
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,979
like master key that is a symmetric key

475
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,679
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> your cell phone and the base</font>

476
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,630
station and so for authentication you

477
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,970
run that through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight which is our</font>

478
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication algorithm it generates</font>

479
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,230
random numbers does in exchange the

480
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,159
verification but essentially it drops

481
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:03,380
out a session key which is your<font color="#CCCCCC"> kc value</font>

482
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:06,350
this then gets fed on to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five which is</font>

483
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,820
actually a stream cipher that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses your</font>

484
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,428
session key for encrypting your whole

485
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,049
conversation and stuff and then you know

486
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:15,950
you carry on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your conversation over the</font>

487
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:17,809
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff so this all looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

488
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,549
standard stream cipher<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people</font>

489
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:24,230
familiar with crypto or stream ciphers

490
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:28,399
in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right the general idea</font>

491
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:31,669
is that if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has anybody here ran</font>

492
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:34,879
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rand or random you know functions</font>

493
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:37,010
like to create random numbers yeah ok so

494
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,539
like before you run a random function

495
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,590
you obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> seed your admin number</font>

496
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:42,559
generator and some people do it with

497
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,658
time or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so assuming that</font>

498
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,830
you seed your random function with you

499
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,450
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same seed you'll end up with</font>

500
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same stream of random numbers coming</font>

501
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,380
out of your random number generator so

502
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:55,189
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five is just a random</font>

503
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:58,730
number generator you if you feed the

504
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:01,130
same key and there's also initialization

505
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,710
vector basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same key on both</font>

506
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,590
sides<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll admit the same random stream</font>

507
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,210
of sequences on both sides and so then

508
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,580
you just do a simple XOR with your plain

509
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,880
text that encrypts it you send it across

510
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,320
and then X or it with the same exact

511
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,850
stream on the other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can</font>

512
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,860
reconstruct it with the same key and

513
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:22,580
then you end up with your plain text on

514
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:25,428
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side well this is actually</font>

515
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,168
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all done like on the fly it's</font>

516
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:31,220
bit by bit it's all shift registers and

517
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:35,870
stuff and so basically the the full

518
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,880
frame is is 114 bits but it's all kind

519
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,629
of done in line

520
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,070
with everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and then and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

521
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,480
send it then you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a new</font>

522
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">frame number and like send any frame</font>

523
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,780
members so there's essentially a unique

524
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,430
frame number for each frame that you're

525
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:54,820
sending across which is 114 bits so

526
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:58,000
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 51 it's actually a set of</font>

527
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:06,550
shift registers and anybody here know to

528
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,170
shift registers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay cool so the</font>

529
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:12,639
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea with a shift register is</font>

530
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:14,830
that you have an array of bits so so all

531
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,490
of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> filled with bits and just</font>

532
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:20,740
looking at like this one register here

533
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,330
with this with this you can have like

534
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,460
you know bits inside of there and then

535
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,730
when you clock it basically all the bits

536
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:30,400
get shifted to one direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

537
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,770
obviously like this bit is going to get

538
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,210
shifted off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that side and nothing's</font>

539
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,590
going to get shift<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto this side and so</font>

540
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,850
what you end up shifting into this side

541
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:41,199
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XOR of these bits here so so</font>

542
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,120
basically this bit here will become

543
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,820
dependent on the bits that were here

544
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">before and so it's kind of kind of a way</font>

545
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:52,810
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> applying XOR to a bunch of bits</font>

546
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,330
recursively people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a lot for four</font>

547
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,980
different error correcting codes people

548
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,600
yeah I do like encryption ciphers

549
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,260
there's there's lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

550
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:05,590
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for shift registers but</font>

551
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,570
that's kind of another talk anyway so

552
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,379
they decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do use three shift</font>

553
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:14,200
registers and and they kind of set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

554
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,880
this clocking way of making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you</font>

555
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,860
can only really clock it forward which

556
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,400
is actually a very weak weak way that

557
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,379
they implemented it and and so the

558
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,590
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that you take your key</font>

559
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,630
like your session key and you take like

560
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,120
the first bit of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you shift it</font>

561
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,460
into these bits over here so if the

562
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,600
first bit is<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero you drop a zero into</font>

563
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,240
their as you're under there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I zero it in</font>

564
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,550
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then for the next bit</font>

565
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you clock this so this gets shifted</font>

566
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,210
into their that won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get shifted into</font>

567
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,830
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that and so on and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you put the</font>

568
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,870
next fit in and so you repeat this

569
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,820
process so all the bits of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key gets</font>

570
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,399
shifted in

571
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,950
and as as these bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> start hitting these</font>

572
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,300
tap registers here they get X sword with

573
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,550
all these other ones and then get X

574
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,020
sword with your input here and so things

575
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:02,430
get just just start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting mixed around</font>

576
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,990
inside the registers and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

577
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,560
clock in the frame number you clock it

578
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,660
for like 100 clock cycles but

579
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,580
essentially this is this is kind of

580
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,200
seated with your key and your frame

581
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,620
number and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just starts emitting</font>

582
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,930
random bits out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side so so</font>

583
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,969
then for actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> output these bits get x</font>

584
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,410
sword together and sent out and that

585
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,210
that's what actually gets x sword with

586
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,120
your plain text or expert with your

587
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,630
cipher text to decrypt it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make</font>

588
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:37,350
sense at all or shine good if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not</font>

589
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">good right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were originally</font>

590
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">planning this whole attack and trying to</font>

591
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out a way to do this all these</font>

592
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,700
other attacks weren't really practical

593
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:47,220
there's no way that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

594
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to guess exactly all the audio that</font>

595
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:53,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens for three minutes or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two minutes</font>

596
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,690
and and we definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want this to</font>

597
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">take in like months to crack a single</font>

598
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,090
conversation you know so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out</font>

599
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,090
that we found some known plaintext<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

600
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:05,399
like the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> few frames and so this</font>

601
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:08,310
means that we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this entirely fully</font>

602
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,410
fully passively<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we use a combination</font>

603
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,720
of a basically a rainbow table attack

604
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:17,430
and a couple other methods to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font>

605
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,740
all work so one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did is</font>

606
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:24,660
that we have these frames that are 114

607
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,490
bits long and we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we take 64</font>

608
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,820
bits at a time at different offsets

609
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,530
inside there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we use these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as kind of</font>

610
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,360
like vectors for a thing it'll make more

611
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,379
sense in just a second here but

612
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,760
essentially we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 bit values that</font>

613
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:43,200
we have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and four of them for</font>

614
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:45,270
all the known plaintext we have and how

615
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is useful is that if you kind of</font>

616
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,460
think of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51 as like a rainbow table</font>

617
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,780
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with land man rainbow</font>

618
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,870
tables if you guys are familiar with

619
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,120
those you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a mapping of a password</font>

620
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,969
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hash and the idea with hashing</font>

621
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,709
functions is that you

622
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,900
can't go back from the hash the password

623
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,910
I mean that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> why you store the hash on</font>

624
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,230
the hard drive you know so if somebody

625
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,900
grabs that they can't really figure out

626
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,490
what your real password is so lame o

627
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,890
tables are great for stuff like this you

628
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just create you know it's mapping of</font>

629
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,460
passwords to hashes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on</font>

630
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,080
you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the hash inside the</font>

631
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,610
table and there's there's all sorts of

632
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,280
optimizations that I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into with</font>

633
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,719
it with how like to compress the tables

634
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,040
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of stuff but</font>

635
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,180
essentially we can treat a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 51 as you</font>

636
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,810
know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a hash function</font>

637
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:36,190
that suitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for rainbow tables and we</font>

638
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:38,679
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 204 data points or hashes over</font>

639
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,600
here that we can you know try to reverse

640
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,250
back and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if we only get one of</font>

641
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,689
these you know we have really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

642
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,700
chances of actually getting the real key

643
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:49,750
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is really important</font>

644
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:57,270
because 64 bits is a huge amount of you

645
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:59,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">know huge key size 44 rainbow table so</font>

646
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">we decided that since we have all these</font>

647
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,210
data points we only need one

648
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:07,570
sixty-fourth of the entire key space but

649
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:10,990
this is still a pretty huge number two

650
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:17,260
to the 58 is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

651
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:20,500
is it's yeah billions of billions a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 288</font>

652
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand billion billion I guess or a</font>

653
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,640
million million<font color="#CCCCCC"> our ability yeah it's</font>

654
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,100
it's a pretty big number and it turns

655
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,260
out that this key space is about 120,000

656
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,439
times larger than largest land man

657
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:34,060
rainbow table out there so if you take

658
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,980
the time it took them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create the</font>

659
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,580
largest land my rainbow table and did

660
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,700
that x<font color="#CCCCCC"> 120,000 then that's the the type</font>

661
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,740
of space<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're talking about here</font>

662
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,750
so it may possibly be the largest

663
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,540
rainbow table ever created but we'll

664
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:52,450
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so we started looking at</font>

665
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,310
creating this and it's like on one pc we

666
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,500
optimized it as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could and</font>

667
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,629
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only getting about like half a</font>

668
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,460
million a five ones per second so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

669
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,950
means meant that we'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait about</font>

670
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:06,730
thirty three thousand years to compute

671
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,360
this or grab 33,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcs and wait a year</font>

672
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,260
so

673
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,490
yeah I get some coffee for a year and

674
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,220
and so we figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a little too</font>

675
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">long to wait so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people here know</font>

676
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">fpgas are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I given talks here before</font>

677
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,750
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpgas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I work for a company that</font>

678
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:27,320
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> FPGA boards and so we had a bunch</font>

679
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,870
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> f DJ's laying around so the</font>

680
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">general idea is that normally with</font>

681
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,949
silicon you create you know processor

682
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,360
for like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> running applications</font>

683
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,010
or whatever or you create like a

684
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,750
graphics card processor or something

685
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,510
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> geared towards you know some sort</font>

686
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:44,030
of purpose so I created basically a

687
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:46,669
processor that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended on just you</font>

688
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:48,049
know creating these rainbow tables and I

689
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:50,900
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just upload it to the device</font>

690
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:55,100
and take over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world right so pretty</font>

691
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were generating the</font>

692
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:04,899
rainbow tables we use 68 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGAs and</font>

693
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:08,230
that equated to about what what is that

694
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,250
72 trillion a five ones per second and

695
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,700
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do in about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three months</font>

696
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,140
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 68 cards and also building</font>

697
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,230
some new hardware that'll make things

698
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,100
cheaper and speed it up a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

699
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,770
this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a picture of the</font>

700
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,449
cluster and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the card that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we use I've</font>

701
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:27,230
actually got one of them my laptop but

702
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:32,299
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use 68 of these just because we</font>

703
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:34,940
had them laying around so the parameters

704
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we use made it so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a cheap</font>

705
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,910
attack where if you happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have six</font>

706
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,889
350 gig hard drives laying around and

707
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:47,299
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> FPGA or a botnet to do your</font>

708
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:50,179
calculations which some people in the

709
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:51,770
room may have it takes you about 30

710
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:55,070
minutes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> crack a conversation and</font>

711
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:57,710
we're also working on a more optimal

712
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:00,740
attack for commercial purposes that will

713
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,000
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 30 seconds but the main main</font>

714
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,710
problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this attack is that it</font>

715
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">requires two terabytes of flash storage</font>

716
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:09,940
or ram storage which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit and</font>

717
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:13,280
we managed to get our hands on some and

718
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:17,690
but uh but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's a kind of hard</font>

719
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,129
thing to find these<font color="#CCCCCC"> days so the other</font>

720
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,590
cool thing about this attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we</font>

721
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:23,710
can speed it up

722
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,029
just adding more<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpgas and or more more</font>

723
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,039
hard drives to the whole equation and

724
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:28,840
the reason why we had to go with flash

725
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,850
drives is because of the random access

726
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,070
is per second normal hard drive you can

727
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,469
only get max like four or five hundred

728
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,120
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> i/o is per second whereas flash</font>

729
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:44,140
drives you can get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten thousand of</font>

730
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:48,070
each one so so then assuming that you

731
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:51,120
can actually reverse the output of a 512

732
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,799
the actual like internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 51</font>

733
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,860
then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to figure out</font>

734
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the key is and so we built this</font>

735
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> method of reverse clocking the</font>

736
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:04,870
state back to the key and and

737
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,639
essentially the the main difficulty with

738
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,289
this is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this</font>

739
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,970
majority clocking sort of thing here

740
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:12,309
it's really difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clock it</font>

741
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,590
backwards but there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a huge</font>

742
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:16,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of states when you analyze like</font>

743
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,330
all the possible clocking combinations

744
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,980
and so so we basically do that clock it

745
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,289
back solve some linear equations and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

746
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,880
have the key and if you guys want a more

747
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:29,559
detailed explanation I can tell you

748
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,929
later but we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on average like</font>

749
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:34,720
three a 5-1 internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> states each time</font>

750
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,159
and and there's there's a couple

751
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,140
different ways of determining if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

752
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,059
the correct one you can you know just

753
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,500
take the key try to encrypt the same

754
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:45,700
packet and see if you get you know the

755
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,140
same random stream out and or you can

756
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,600
just check for common<font color="#CCCCCC"> states and stuff</font>

757
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:53,020
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's basically like</font>

758
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,539
this is fairly easy and we just ya<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

759
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:59,740
it all scripted so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big of</font>

760
00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:00,850
a deal for verse clocking it so I don't

761
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you guys have seen this new</font>

762
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:07,928
paper that came out but it's based on

763
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:11,529
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really old attacks on a 5-1 that</font>

764
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:12,880
date back to like 1998 the there's a

765
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,700
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just started</font>

766
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,100
throwing<font color="#E5E5E5"> out these attacks on</font>

767
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:20,409
essentially you brute force<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

768
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,418
registers and then you kind of like

769
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:25,270
solve the third one by just looking at

770
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:27,520
the output of a 51 and there's some

771
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,450
optimizations you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the</font>

772
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,418
two to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 64 down to like to the 48 and</font>

773
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:37,369
these guys implemented

774
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:39,230
on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware on fpgas and it turns</font>

775
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:43,039
out they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in about 14 hours</font>

776
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,749
with 120<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGAs and so to scale it to</font>

777
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,840
basically like our optimal attack they

778
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:49,909
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 200,000</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fpgas to do the same</font>

779
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,168
thing as a rainbow table so so basically

780
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:52,789
like if you're trying to attack hash

781
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:59,179
functions rainbow tables are pretty

782
00:32:52,789 --> 00:33:01,629
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's all I'm saying and yes</font>

783
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:04,519
for us other tax<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's they're mostly</font>

784
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,779
infeasible we looked at pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

785
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,450
of them we've implemented some of them

786
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:11,269
and they just it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem like</font>

787
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:16,609
they would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> practically work for</font>

788
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:18,350
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out there so some details</font>

789
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:20,989
about about this whole attack and how it

790
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,119
applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this only</font>

791
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:26,029
recovers the KC which is a temporal key

792
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,759
and so it only recover the key for that

793
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:31,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">one conversation some carriers also</font>

794
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:33,950
reuse the key for up to I think like six

795
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,659
or ten conversations after so it's

796
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,190
possible that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuse it you know</font>

797
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:41,210
for a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> more times before you have to</font>

798
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:43,159
crack it again but but it doesn't really

799
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:46,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you like their master key like you</font>

800
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,070
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep on cracking so so it's a I</font>

801
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:50,779
mean it's within reach but it's still

802
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,639
kind of difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

803
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,499
implement something that'll like crack

804
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:59,508
everyone's phone calls or you know do

805
00:33:54,499 --> 00:34:02,389
world domination sort of stuff so in

806
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:04,009
conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's a couple of</font>

807
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:08,449
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can maybe walk away from</font>

808
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:10,969
this talk with GSM security should

809
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:13,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">become more secure or at least people</font>

810
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:16,668
should know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they shouldn't</font>

811
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:19,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">be talking about secure things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over gsm</font>

812
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:21,739
and there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different products</font>

813
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,119
coming out for for you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping out</font>

814
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,770
with that there's like the crypto phone

815
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,190
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people are just moving to like</font>

816
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,690
encrypted VoIP and stuff like that and

817
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've been using this thing called cell</font>

818
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,879
crypt and that works pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good but</font>

819
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:36,049
anyway just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that like you</font>

820
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,299
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody could possibly be</font>

821
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:41,030
listening over the line and and you know

822
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:42,679
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything the operator could just be</font>

823
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:46,070
having taps like inside there

824
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:50,449
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center so just don't please don't</font>

825
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:52,910
rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security of VSM also just</font>

826
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:54,679
the whole tracking aspect with IMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

827
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:56,810
being leaked there's all sorts of

828
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,299
implications for that like targeted

829
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,279
advertising on people like you know you

830
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,870
spot somebody doing something you record

831
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,400
there MZ and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know every time</font>

832
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,040
they walk by you know you like do

833
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,450
targeted ads at them you can see like

834
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,520
you know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are visiting where</font>

835
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:13,520
people are going I don't know there's

836
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,110
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of interesting areas that you</font>

837
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,890
know gray areas that people could

838
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:22,310
exploit and just start spamming the real

world<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

840
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,360
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how this stuff pans</font>

841
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,500
out and then of course one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our one of</font>

00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,910
our things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're worried about is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">unlawful interception like you know</font>

unsavory characters out there like us

845
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:38,540
you know just sniffing to anybody's

846
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,740
phone calls so I mean this it's possible

847
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,330
in the future that this will become

848
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,890
cheap enough that every everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

849
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,150
can do it and hopefully the new

850
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,810
infrastructure will be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stop</font>

851
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of thing and then obviously a</font>

852
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:53,090
since we have a software radio that lets

853
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,060
you listen to stuff why can't we also

854
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,530
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transmitted to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

855
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:01,549
that that makes some other major

856
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:03,290
implications just that like if we can

857
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,880
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> start writing code that you know</font>

858
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,820
start sending out packets directly to

859
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network you know like you think that</font>

860
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,170
they've actually checked for buffer

861
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,750
overflows and their switches you know is

862
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,040
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to possibly route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto their</font>

863
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,300
internal networks and stuff like that I

864
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,090
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's lots of lots of</font>

865
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,920
interesting areas that people may start

866
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,780
to look at once you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this becomes</font>

867
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,060
more within reach with actually playing

868
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,620
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and then you know with</font>

869
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of subscribers out there it's</font>

870
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,680
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a huge playground and there's</font>

871
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,750
so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different possibilities of</font>

872
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,890
different attack vectors so it's

873
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:39,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually quite scary and and then also</font>

874
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:42,290
yeah just everything will become cheaper

875
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:46,190
and easier I mean it's been out for I

876
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:47,840
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> three decades now and our</font>

877
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,550
computing power is just increasing so

878
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,280
much with Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Law at like you know</font>

879
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:54,860
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5-10 years that anybody can</font>

880
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,200
do the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so so</font>

881
00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:00,080
it's good that 3g is slowly rolling out

882
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,669
and 3g should should end up fixing this

883
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,170
whole thing but if there's backwards

884
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,790
compatibility then you know there's

885
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">always the possibility of downgrading</font>

886
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:12,520
people back to to gsm so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

887
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">how i'm doing on time here looks like</font>

888
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:19,910
okay all right hello early but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

889
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,980
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> take questions and and yeah if you</font>

890
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:24,259
guys want some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> detailed information</font>

891
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,600
i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you like you know down the</font>

892
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,740
hallway<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff but just before i take</font>

893
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,110
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to do a couple</font>

894
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:33,020
shoutouts to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what content is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in</font>

895
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,820
san diego end of September we kind of

896
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,009
released these dates at work on Seattle

897
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,250
and I think maybe shmoocon or something

898
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,300
but it's definitely this weekend and

899
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,920
we're also working on tour camp next

900
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:49,430
year we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting actually a</font>

901
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:52,040
Bandhan a nuclear power plant to camp

902
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,779
out at so we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that works out</font>

903
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,130
we're still talking with them otherwise

904
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,230
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and look at getting a</font>

905
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,440
missile silo or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

906
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:02,390
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to that next next spring</font>

907
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,800
should be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool but ok so any</font>

908
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,799
questions anyway oh go ahead

909
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:26,520
the question was like basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpgas</font>

910
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus GPUs and like how they can be</font>

911
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:32,370
used for cracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I've started to see</font>

912
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,810
people using gpus for doing crypto

913
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,359
cracking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that elcomsoft</font>

914
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,310
actually just<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out with plugins for</font>

915
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,980
their password cracking stuff that

916
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,910
support GPUs or at least say they have a

917
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,660
press release I don't think they

918
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:47,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have software yet but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

919
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,560
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longest time the main</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

920
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,330
was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing like crypto stuff and</font>

921
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,710
floating point was was a big problem and

922
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">so maybe they've managed to get around</font>

923
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,550
that at least with certain cards but

924
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,129
yeah it would definitely be interesting

925
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:00,600
once um you know because GPUs are in

926
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,370
like almost everybody's machine nowadays

927
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,100
it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you know machine</font>

928
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,210
without a decent graphics cards so it

929
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,830
would be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to see how</font>

930
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,330
like you know people start writing

931
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:11,250
distributed net sort of stuff for this

932
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:13,350
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know suddenly you have like</font>

933
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,390
tons of computers on the internet that

934
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">are available for doing that stuff so</font>

935
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:22,920
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be really interesting to see</font>

936
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:25,020
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that um yeah you</font>

937
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,860
saying the GPUs aren't general-purpose

938
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:31,950
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this natively um well it I</font>

939
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,960
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like if elcomsoft is doing</font>

940
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,669
it then you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably some</font>

941
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,960
hack to do it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think it's</font>

942
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,730
really a mainstream sort of method

943
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,680
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they aren't really a whole lot</font>

944
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,170
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there for doing it there</font>

945
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,740
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been a lot of projects have</font>

946
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:49,770
sprouted up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s PE zor</font>

947
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:53,910
SPU's on the on the Cell processor like

948
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:56,370
for the ps3 and like there's a there's

949
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,259
WEP cracking support that I think HDM

950
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">coded and for that there's also think</font>

951
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,830
somebody did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> WPA thing or something</font>

952
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's a couple different projects</font>

953
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:06,750
for doing that but but with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

954
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,839
mostly just using it you know it's like

955
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,720
a few extra processors so you get you

956
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,100
know decent speed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not not really</font>

957
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:18,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">comparable to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGAs with some algorithms</font>

958
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:20,720
so any other questions

959
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,720
good

960
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:48,250
cool what was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name the cardigan</font>

961
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:50,320
Egeus a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ga I guess the gia card has</font>

962
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,579
stuff for just solving math equations so

963
00:40:50,320 --> 00:41:01,540
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting to look into</font>

964
00:40:51,579 --> 00:41:03,550
for crypto good<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question was I have</font>

965
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:06,460
the sims become more powerful as times

966
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,290
gone on sim cards I mean now they have

967
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,800
like java virtual machines they have

968
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:13,509
tons of storage there's a you know like

969
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java applets basically like running on</font>

970
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,079
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIM card yeah there's there's</font>

971
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,700
definitely a lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

972
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,079
been going on in and it's also

973
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,089
constantly evolving you know they're

974
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,180
adding lots of new features to them and

975
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:26,950
stuff like that so so it's almost kind

976
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,660
of like just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an extra computer inside</font>

977
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:31,359
your cell phone right you can run code

978
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:35,290
on and do stuff with so it's really

979
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,119
quite interesting like a yeah thinking

980
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,410
about oh well you know something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font>

981
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,640
with my cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

982
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,078
you know taking my sim card and<font color="#CCCCCC"> throw in</font>

983
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,490
something else you know like it just

984
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,920
keeps on following you you know two new

985
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,598
phones and so it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting attack</font>

986
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,829
vector if like viruses start coming out

987
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:51,030
and like you can have it spread through

988
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:55,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIM cards and stuff or I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

989
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,500
oh go ahead pity

990
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:16,600
yeah yeah the question was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a the</font>

991
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,980
operator can push code into the GV m and

992
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:23,980
so does that mean that you can basically

993
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:26,320
write those there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

994
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:29,380
the code that's sent to the SIM card is

995
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:31,120
actually signed and some people have

996
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,470
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signed with</font>

997
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,880
like something some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real</font>

998
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,319
signature and some people have said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

999
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just based on like the source</font>

1000
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">address that it comes from and so</font>

1001
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,220
there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of conflicting</font>

1002
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,600
things and we're still trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

1003
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but that'll probably vary</font>

1004
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,110
depending on the subscriber how they

1005
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,110
implement you know what updates they

1006
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:49,510
want to receive but but basically from

1007
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,490
what from what we know all this stuff is

1008
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,470
verified on the phone before it uploads

1009
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,049
it to the sim and from the phone to the

1010
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:58,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">sim there isn't really any sort of</font>

1011
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:02,520
authentication as far as we know that's

1012
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,520
a understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so far</font>

1013
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,580
yeah the question was could you then

1014
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,840
like upload your own stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the sim if</font>

1015
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,240
he had access to it that's that's what

1016
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe is possible so yeah like if</font>

1017
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:28,799
you steal someone sim you can yeah

1018
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:30,660
exactly yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah either way you</font>

1019
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,390
should you should watch out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

1020
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,759
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> who you give your sim to another</font>

1021
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:37,529
thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sim is that because that</font>

1022
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">88 algorithm that I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

1023
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:42,000
actually runs directly on your sim if

1024
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,069
somebody has recorded all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1025
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,990
conversations and they get access to

1026
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,700
your sim then they can run through and

1027
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,740
generate your session Keys like for

1028
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,689
whatever talk whatever you know calls

1029
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,520
you made in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past and then decrypt</font>

1030
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,860
them you know if they if they haven't

1031
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,880
logged and so I mean there's lots of

1032
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,460
things that people can do once they

1033
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,020
after sim your sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd be really</font>

1034
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them to you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compute</font>

1035
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,070
all the possible keys for the future but

1036
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:09,710
they can definitely get your past calls

1037
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:09,710
if they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> mo logged go ahead</font>

1038
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:27,250
oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is how does how</font>

1039
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:29,079
does this stuff apply to blackberry and

1040
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,670
I guess like other ip-based sort of

1041
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,930
stuff like like email and things like

1042
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:36,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the cell phones use</font>

1043
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,069
a totally different encryption algorithm

1044
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:42,130
for like GPRS and you know like edge and

1045
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:43,509
and stuff like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this this</font>

1046
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:48,369
stuff wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to that it would</font>

1047
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:50,349
only apply to SMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and calls so I as</font>

1048
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:51,730
far as i know the algorithms that they

1049
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:53,920
use for all the data stuff isn't really

1050
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">public and and we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really know any</font>

1051
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">information about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you may look</font>

1052
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,930
into it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future but we don't</font>

1053
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,000
really know like for now it seems like

1054
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stuff is secure until people figure</font>

1055
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:11,190
it out any other questions oh go ahead

1056
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:45,380
oh yeah I have a sigh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the</font>

1057
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,210
question is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you get them aside</font>

1058
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,869
then can you kind of use that to clone

1059
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:52,400
the phone right well what really what it

1060
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:54,500
comes down to is the the key that's

1061
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,569
actually stored on your sim and so you'd

1062
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,910
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extract the key from the sim in</font>

1063
00:45:56,569 --> 00:46:05,599
order to actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clone stuff</font>

1064
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:07,190
like that and yeah you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

1065
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generate the same session</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keys and</font>

1066
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:10,640
like the same responses to the

1067
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:14,450
authentication and stuff like that so so

1068
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,660
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to crack the master</font>

1069
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:20,598
key on the sim and with with older

1070
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,609
versions of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 or comp 128 there's ways</font>

1071
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:24,170
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do stuff like that as far as the</font>

1072
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:25,578
newer stuff we we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know what</font>

1073
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,049
the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm is so if you have a</font>

1074
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:29,000
newer sim then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be pretty</font>

1075
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:32,538
difficult for somebody to clone that at

1076
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,269
least in the moment well yeah I mean

1077
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:36,829
like they could always<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw it under an</font>

1078
00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:38,328
electron microscope drop down some

1079
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:40,759
probes and like read off your key if

1080
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:43,039
they really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but just like</font>

1081
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:46,190
dropping it into a reader and like you

1082
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,299
know trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it that ways we don't</font>

1083
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,079
know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any way to do that with the new</font>

1084
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:50,079
sims at the moment

1085
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:03,560
uh yeah yeah yeah the question was or

1086
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:05,210
coming yeah yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's</font>

1087
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,700
there's definitely ways to like

1088
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,420
intrusive ways of recovering it like I

1089
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know if you guys have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

1090
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">Christopher knob skis talk but he</font>

1091
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:14,540
basically like d caps the actual dies

1092
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,010
and like drops down probes and reads he

1093
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,650
can like read off the firmware off of

1094
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:21,440
the cards and also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Casey's and chaos</font>

1095
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:22,700
or whatever so there's a there's lots of

1096
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,609
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> options for doing this stuff</font>

1097
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,020
but but just like most people don't have

1098
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:29,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the equipment to do stuff like that so I</font>

1099
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:34,359
mean it's kind of out of the question

1100
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,359
for most people go ahead

1101
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:58,970
um well the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> was I seen like</font>

1102
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:01,640
these these things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> read our readers</font>

1103
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:04,549
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like SD cards that can like</font>

1104
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,600
read stuff off your sim are you talking

1105
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,400
about like ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can back up your</font>

1106
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:11,630
contact information and stuff like that

1107
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:14,210
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah those those can recover</font>

1108
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,400
those can't get recover your master key

1109
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:19,190
because there's no way with the protocol

1110
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,500
to actually read that back it's a you

1111
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,550
know it's like burned like into the sim

1112
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,440
and there's no way to read it back

1113
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,440
through software least as far as we know

1114
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,939
yeah yeah exactly

1115
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:48,359
yeah exactly i'm like a lot of smart

1116
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:50,410
cards and stuff like that either do like

1117
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:52,029
well a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them do this thing were</font>

1118
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:53,859
they like right<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the region and they</font>

1119
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:55,599
blow a fuse like actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the on the</font>

1120
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:57,249
chip<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes it so it's impossible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1121
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,859
read it back or you know anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1122
00:48:57,249 --> 00:49:01,779
that in the future and then so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1123
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:04,390
the only interface that you have to the

1124
00:49:01,779 --> 00:49:06,339
master key is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a eight which is you know</font>

1125
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:08,680
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feed it a random</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> value it spits</font>

1126
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:10,269
