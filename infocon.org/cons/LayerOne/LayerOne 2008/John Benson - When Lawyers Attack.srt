along with it having had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to been through</font>

16
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,679
electronic discovery I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions as</font>

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,909
we go through I do ask is I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ton</font>

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">of material to cover in the next 50</font>

20
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,090
minutes just kind of hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to those</font>

21
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,000
questions until the very end and then we

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,170
can address them then what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,220
to do is we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,490
history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of electronic discovery what it</font>

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,350
is why this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only now really coming to</font>

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,310
light and why this is only now really an

27
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,429
issue talk about why the process costs

28
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,500
so much to law firms to individuals to

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,590
corporations I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">some very simple things that can be done</font>

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,360
on a policy level to control some of

32
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,789
those costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you don't anticipate</font>

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,170
litigation right now and then I'm going

34
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk a little bit about some of the</font>

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,630
vendors and some of the technologies

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> support electronic discovery and</font>

37
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,899
why that's some pretty scary<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but</font>

38
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,020
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to tell you a little bit</font>

39
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,700
about myself if you don't know me I went

40
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University of Missouri in</font>

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,119
Columbia where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned to hate k you</font>

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,930
and I got a degree in finance

43
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,560
after that I went to the UMKC School law

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:21,269
and then took the bar exam I passed the

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,920
bar exam and was looking for a job and I

46
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,590
really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find something where I</font>

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,589
could use both my technology skills and

48
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,450
my skills as an attorney and most firms

49
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,890
just didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand why that</font>

50
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:37,078
was why that was necessary so you know i

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,879
SAT around looking for a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> and did</font>

52
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:41,549
some freelance web design which of

53
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,179
course means I was just unemployed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

54
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:48,650
long time after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running out</font>

55
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">of money I went to work for a very large</font>

56
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,200
defense firm in Kansas City doing

57
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:57,930
electronic discovery analysis work which

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,480
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice way of saying that I was a</font>

59
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,840
document reviewer which translates

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,018
roughly in this age to reading other

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,720
people's email eight hours a day I did

62
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,370
that for around<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten months well that may</font>

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,099
seem like a dream while you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

64
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,500
get into somebody's email trust me it's

65
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:21,060
not worth it it's dreadfully boring and

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,069
terrible now I work for a firm called

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stenson Morrison</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hecker based in Kansas</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know that I am an attorney and</font>

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,370
that I am employed you can imagine

74
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,980
what's coming next nothing of what I'm

75
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,169
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present is anything directly</font>

from my employer or any other

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,090
organization that I've been affiliated

78
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,489
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly none of this is meant to</font>

79
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,230
be legal advice to any of you all or

80
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,169
your organization's in this context at

81
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,768
least and while I am an attorney I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

82
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:07,919
NOT your attorney and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I</font>

83

am an attorney I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to be trusted or</font>

relied upon in any kind of way

85
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:22,070
so on with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> show what is electronic</font>

86
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:27,470
discovery and where did this really

87
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:29,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">large sea change come from well in the</font>

88
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,000
law the civil litigation process is

89
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">google is governed in the federal courts</font>

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,290
by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

91
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,870
and up until two thousand six there was

92
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:45,970
nothing explicit within the rules to

93
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,740
address electronic evidence whatsoever

94
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:53,000
everything was conducted the same way it

95
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,100
always has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been well finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,590
started realizing that there's

97
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting stuff there and we need to</font>

98
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,419
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the exchange of information</font>

99
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:04,969
between opposing sides and litigation

100
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:07,150
and they made a number of sweeping

101
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,570
changes to the rules of civil procedure

102
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:15,440
which addressed this I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address a</font>

103
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:18,919
misconception though that this does not

104
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,960
affect criminal law<font color="#E5E5E5"> and depending on</font>

105
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:25,430
situation this may not actually affect

106
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,799
state law cases so if you are being sued

107
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">in federal court in the civil system you</font>

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:35,120
will be subject to this if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are being</font>

109
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,580
criminally prosecuted this these rules

110
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,610
do not apply but there's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

111
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,639
a caveat about that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of federal law</font>

112
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:46,220
out there involving technology will have

113
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,380
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal component as well as a civil</font>

114
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,110
component that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely the case</font>

115
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:55,280
with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

116
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:57,080
and as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the DMCA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can</font>

117
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,289
be prosecuted<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be sued</font>

118
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,740
on top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not clear we all</font>

119
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember oj he was he was criminally</font>

120
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:11,449
prosecuted acquitted and then sued in

121
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,020
civil court based<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon some of his</font>

122
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:17,449
alleged actions

123
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,370
so up until december two thousand six

124
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,639
there were no provisions that required

125
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:27,529
attorneys to address electronic data at

126
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:30,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">all why is that you know we do a lot of</font>

127
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:32,719
the times that you hear lawyer speak

128
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:35,060
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lots of questions and you here</font>

129
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:37,639
we don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet we don't know how the</font>

130
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,659
courts are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address it which can</font>

131
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:44,240
be very frustrating so the reason that

132
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get that answer a lot is because the</font>

133
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,590
common<font color="#E5E5E5"> law system is designed to move</font>

134
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:52,250
very slowly and very incremental<font color="#E5E5E5"> e and</font>

135
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,049
that common law system is pretty well

136
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,379
reflected with the attorneys that are

137
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,840
out there they're very old timey they

138
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:02,240
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to cling to their to their</font>

139
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,419
ways and they're very resistant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

140
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,460
change and that you know that's fine but

141
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,008
it can definitely create a lot of

142
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">ambiguity in the law whenever you have</font>

143
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:16,759
new technologies coming up and new

144
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,409
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this attorneys are not</font>

145
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,419
exactly what you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> call the most</font>

146
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,069
technologically savvy individuals if

147
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,529
you've ever worked with a law firm or

148
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,169
worked with your own attorney<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tried</font>

149
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,879
to correspond over email I know lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

150
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,799
attorneys that don't read their own

00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">email they have their secretaries print</font>

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,629
them and then bring the moon and then

153
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:37,188
they actually still dictate on tape and

154
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:39,439
then their secretaries will go back and

155
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:43,219
then type emails and send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on</font>

00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:46,839

157
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:50,210
that I know some attorneys that some are

158
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:52,009
just now running into spreadsheets and

159
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,729
wondering how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to navigate around</font>

160
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:59,899
spreadsheets which can also be kind of

161
00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:01,460
shocking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this day and age so the</font>

for some sweeping changes that make a

going to be making these decisions it's

177
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:50,720
the I had a professor actually once

refer to it as you know think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think</font>

is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> new to compute it to two</font>

191
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,020
attorneys it's just now that they're

192
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,290
realizing that there are interesting

193
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,270
things in computers and and we might

going through lawsuits it's it's it's

196
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,240
very frightening because this lack of

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,390
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technology is what's</font>

198
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,510
really shaping the conversations

199
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:47,660
involving electronic discovery and all

200
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,700
of the exchange of data early in

201
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,800
litigation before they bring in experts

202
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,740
and before a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people involved in</font>

203
00:09:51,800 --> 00:10:01,370
technology at organizations become fully

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:03,380
involved electronic discovery is the

205
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,170
descriptions are largely driven by

206
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">buzzwords the people here in CLE s and</font>

207
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:15,620
by urban legends attorneys are

208
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,300
frightened of metadata I remember going

209
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,580
through law school and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were talking</font>

210
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the coming changes and and and how</font>

211
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,350
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> is changing things and you</font>

212
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,700
know I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking along the lines of</font>

213
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the amazing things that you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

214

forensics and backing in going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

215
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,870
seeing what people have done even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

216
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,089
they think that it's all been white and

217
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,360
some of my professors say well no it's

218
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:37,649
all about the metadata

219
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,529
all about metadata I'm like what the

220
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,910
hell<font color="#CCCCCC"> is meant what so you know I start</font>

221
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:44,279
looking and there's not really a lot of

222
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,769
stuff just describing metadata but it's

223
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,120
all it is is data about data but

224
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:50,430
attorneys think that it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

225
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:56,670
very frightening something to be feared

226
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know you this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a screenshot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

227
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,110
a weblog post by this attorney I'm sure

228
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,019
is a very nice gentleman and a pillar of

229
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,899
the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> community but he's expressing</font>

230
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:10,550
his shock in this blog post that there's

231
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:13,529
hidden information in digital photos

232
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,990
gasps I mean it's it's it's it's it's

233
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,240
everywhere you know and and you know I'd

some of the times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know the</font>

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the questions are not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where is the data</font>

238
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:29,729
get to it it's what are we going to do

239
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,560
about the metadata and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

times<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say well do you really</font>

241
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,500
understand what metadata is and the

242
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,779
general consensus within the attorney

243
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,810
within a lot of attorneys is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

244
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,730
track changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft Word and the</font>

to a certain extent but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fear of</font>

248
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,399
from this urban legend<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has spread</font>

typing up a bench brief for this judge

251

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,360
enough to open up track changes and see

all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the that were</font>

before I move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a</font>

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:43,490
little but some confusion about what

267
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,610
these rules are and what they aren't

268
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,750
these rules are not per se a compliance

269
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,840
requirement like sorry bye

270
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">oxley companies don't necessarily have</font>

271
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:59,550
to do anything new as a result of these

272
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,900
rule changes and most companies haven't

273
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,339
what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they change what</font>

274
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,170
attorneys<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and the way the process</font>

275
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,720
works so unless you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legal</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">process then you don't necessarily need</font>

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do anything different than you did</font>

278
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,490
before and that's that's leading<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

279
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:18,180
lot of increased costs for companies as

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think potentially that the rules</font>

haven't had to make any<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes unless</font>

294
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,370
you're in litigation at this point in

response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the the electronic discovery</font>

297
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,410
companies spent millions and millions

came into effect there have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

two instances of fines or sanctions

then they came<font color="#CCCCCC"> into effect in what</font>

304
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,650
2004-2005 something like that since

305
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:33,010
december of 2006 we've already had over

306
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:37,030
60 cases of sanctions against attorneys

307

comply with the new rules of electronic

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,359

just kind of flown under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of money in the amount of effort</font>

that had to be expended because of

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,819
sarbanes-oxley the companies are now

315
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,279
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you know we had to spend</font>

00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,699
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money now we got this other</font>

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,439
going on I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do it do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

318
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:06,300
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of deal with it as we go</font>

319
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">along so let's move along and will now</font>

320
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:13,199
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how the electronic discovery</font>

321
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:15,899
process works this is a chart from the

322
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,290
the electronic discovery reference model

323
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:22,559
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a industry think tank</font>

324
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,959
and it's there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of great</font>

325
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,999
information within this chart but it's

326
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,989
kind of confusing so I've got it

327
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:33,180
simplified over here let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your</font>

328
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,249
company gets sued we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work</font>

329
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,040
this all the way through litigation a

330
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:40,379
very simplified state the first step<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

331
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,959
course is to say what information<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you</font>

332
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,879
have and where is it seems like a very

333
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,949
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but of course we all</font>

334
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,680
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's definitely not for any</font>

335
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:51,809
organization of virtually any signs now

336
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,569
I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on my own computer I</font>

337
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:58,769
could I can only go see it gets even

338
00:15:54,569 --> 00:16:01,319
worse with very large companies so you

339
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:02,639
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify what you have then you</font>

340
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to take a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're being</font>

341
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,649
sued about and you need to preserve that

342
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,870
data which this means stopping your

343
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,399
recycling of backup tapes a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

344
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,439
coming in and taking images of hard

345
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,809
drives it all kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

346
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:18,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">the what the attorneys negotiate at the</font>

347
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,040
very beginning after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all the data</font>

348
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,949
that's going to be potentially

349
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,050
responsive to the lawsuit is collected

350
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:27,059
and you can collect in a number of

351
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,670
different ways it all depends on the

352
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,920
case sometimes you'll be having forensic

353
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,670
work done on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side of the scale</font>

354
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,439
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have just individuals dragging</font>

355
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,990
over files that relate to a certain

356
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:43,379
matter into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a folder and putting them on</font>

357
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:47,759
CD and science their attorney it that's

358
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:49,829
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common after that the all of</font>

359
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">those emails</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data needs</font>

360
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:53,939
to be reviewed for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of different</font>

361
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,910
things somebody needs to see if it's

362
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:58,050
actually responsive to the lawsuit a lot

363
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,670
of times you'll need to look at the

364
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:03,059
documents to see if they're privileged

365
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,648
or not depending on the case they may

366
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:07,199
have negotiated that certain trade

367
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,908
secrets will be redacted so that

368
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,620
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be needed will need to</font>

369
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:12,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">be redacted</font>

370
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:16,678
it's very very time consuming as as all

371
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,990
as all show as we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

372
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">initial review is done you narrow this</font>

373
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,270
down to a production set than you give

374
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,799
to opposing counsel and opposing counsel

375
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,980
then we'll sift through all of the data

376
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you've produced and eventually a</font>

377
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,440
lot of times years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later you will</font>

378
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally get to trial or you'll use a lot</font>

379
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:42,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this in depositions things like that</font>

380
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:46,549
so how does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work more in a more</font>

381
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:49,470
detailed way a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

382
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:51,629
preserving data and taking steps to make

383
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:55,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that stuff isn't deleted as soon as</font>

384
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:57,270
they anticipate litigation when does

385
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that trigger exactly certainly if you</font>

386
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,080
called your attorney it you can

387
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,340
reasonably anticipate litigation if you

388
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,860
get a threatening<font color="#CCCCCC"> letter or demand</font>

389
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,860
letter that needs to happen then or of

390
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,770
course if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> served with you with a</font>

391
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,990
complaint then you'll need to start

392
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:15,179
preserving data of course does that

393
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen not in all cases a lot of the</font>

394
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,770
times you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some lag which can</font>

395
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,168
lead to data loss which can cause some

396
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:27,510
serious problems for the client down the

397
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:29,760
road after the litigation is anticipated

398
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,669
in-house counsel will usually issue a

399
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,010
litigation hold saying to to a certain

400
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:38,159
number of employees or the entire firm

401
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:40,470
saying hey you need to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> saving this</font>

402
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,620
stuff a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these holds are very</font>

403
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,299
broad I'll talk a little bit about some

404
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,539
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems that can happen with</font>

405
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:51,270
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the the data is then</font>

406
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:53,640
collected this is where this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

407
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:57,510
the wheels start to fall off as far as

408
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,940
an organization's information the data

409
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:03,240
is then usually sent to a vendor and

410
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,130
that vendor can be a very large outfit

411
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,309
that will be will host everything or it

412
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,100
can be an individual law firm they've

413
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,450
got to then process all of the

414
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,280
information there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of file</font>

conversion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to happen the</font>

416
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,830
preferred file format for all of these

417
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">documents electronically believe it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

422
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,199
you've run into a lot of problems with

things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were never meant to be on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">time-consuming process so you take a</font>

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the document you say is this</font>

433

responsive to this litigation yes or no

434
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,030
is this potentially privileged a lot of

435
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
the times you'll have multiple levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

436
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,090
reviewers so they'll say yeah it looks

00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it might be privileged so that goes</font>

438
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,720
into a separate bucket and somebody else

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it later on a lot of</font>

441
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,120
because the processing is not really all

442
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,770
that effective so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have people</font>

443
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,469
going through individually looking at

444
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:26,370
native files then the redaction process

445
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,710
happens and what redaction is is you sit

446
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,110
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you draw black boxes on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

490
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:21,470
up so fast at this point and that's

491
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:23,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">after you've already spent a ballpark</font>

about the cost of restoring backup tapes

and putting them in a format that can

then be reviewed it just it just

501
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:53,870
snowballs very very quickly a lot of the

502
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:56,270
costs though are caused by users and in

503
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,879
just how people interact with computers

504
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,929
because a lot of general users were

505
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,000
never taught how to do things

506
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:05,000
efficiently and how to never do things

<font color="#E5E5E5">properly so one of the things that</font>

00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,240
about football but either way if you're

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about trade secrets or other</font>

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,410
an attorney has sit there and draw that

533
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,850
box over and over and over and over you

534
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,190
know how do you like to spend an entire

535
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,780
day reading the same email thread over

536
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:16,020
and over and drawing about 200 boxes

537
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:19,820
over it it's it's nonsense trying to

538
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:23,160
send links to things instead of just

539
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,659
sending the file you're going to be

540
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,710
creating duplicate duplicates of the

541
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:32,040
file sending it all around I don't

542
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:34,770
insolence is I've heard of places who

573
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,210
potentially privileged and so you're

574
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,090
going to have two lawyers looking at

575
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,770
that so here's a very simple idea if you

576
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,020
have in-house counsel who's going to be

577
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,670
talking about privilege and

578
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,590
formation as well as non-privileged

579
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,380
stuff why not make him use two different

580
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,300
email addresses make him use one<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all</font>

581
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,800
of his privileged communication make him

582
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,889
when you use one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

583
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,610
nonsense that Creed that could cut quite

584
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,550
a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things so outside</font>

585
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:19,100
of user education what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

586
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:22,730
done to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce some of this cost single</font>

587
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:25,550
instance email is big they that's that's

588
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:29,800
a very emerging trend among companies to

589
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:33,590
go to send links not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual documents</font>

590
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,990
use a document management system you

591
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,020
know users<font color="#CCCCCC"> will hate it I hate my</font>

592
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,340
document management system they all suck

593
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,830
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> terrible to work with but</font>

594
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,209
in the long run that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best way that</font>

595
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:49,220
you can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> care of a lot of these</font>

596
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:52,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems and you further for the cissp</font>

597
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:54,220
is out there treat litigation just like

598
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:57,350
any other issue in business continuity

599
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,360
have a plan and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement it</font>

600
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,280
at a moment's notice whenever you hear

601
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,959
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawyer that it's time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

602
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:08,660
preserving information<font color="#CCCCCC"> learnt you teach</font>

603
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,330
your users to delete things<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no</font>

604
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:14,090
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have you know your top executive</font>

605
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,919
of course who's definitely in charge you

606
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">know he everybody else may have a one</font>

607

608
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,310
calls up and says I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to clear</font>

609
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,740
out my inbox increase my size to 10 gigs

610
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:26,679
of course they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

611
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,060
is that really what needs to happen

612
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,610
another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce</font>

613
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:35,629
risk of some serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff down the road</font>

614
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:39,290
is IT people in technology people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

615
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:41,180
having backups multiple backups and we

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to lose the data so a lot of</font>

617
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,110
the times you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rogue</font>

618
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,240
backups don't you got it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a DVD</font>

619
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,860
burned sitting in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk that nobody</font>

620
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,010
knows about that you're ready in case

621
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,389
something happens but down the road if

622
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,250
that's already if a lot of that

623
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:58,190
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> has already been purged the</font>

624
00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:01,940
right way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then somebody finds out oh</font>

625
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:04,100
wait you've got that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks now your</font>

626
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:07,340
company could be facing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

627
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,139
potential sanctions and maybe some very

628
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,850
bad

629
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,720
the jury<font color="#CCCCCC"> instructions when you get to</font>

630
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:18,370
try now I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

631
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">buzzword that's data map a lot of</font>

632
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,280
lawyers will now say well we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

633
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:26,320
them a data map<font color="#E5E5E5"> going where's the data</font>

634
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:29,070
map what data mapping is is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

635
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,330
enumeration of where all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

636
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,340
it can come in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different forms</font>

637
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,750
in fact is kind of what I do and every

638
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,070
every data map that's done looks a

639
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,070
little bit different depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

640
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,780
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> but think instead of not</font>

641
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,870
what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with</font>

642
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,910
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where you would want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it so</font>

643
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you're facing a hearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

644
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:51,760
potential spoliation of evidence and

645
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,080
accusations of improper preservation you

646
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,480
want to have you know essentially a

647
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,000
binder sitting there of all the

648
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,190
information how you know where it was

649
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,310
originally what the policies were what

650
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:06,010
steps we took logs narratives all kinds

651
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:08,500
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff it'll get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very large but it's a</font>

652
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,910
very effective way of protecting the

653
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,400
company if you're already in litigation

654
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:14,380
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beautiful thing is you can do it</font>

655
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,360
before litigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way if you get</font>

656
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,940
served your attorney just pulls it right

657
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,469
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shelf and instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of spending a</font>

658
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,510
lot of time wondering where everything

659
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,030
is they can go right to identifying

660
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:27,090
individual custodians and preparing for

661
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:30,190
some of the early pretrial conferences

662
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,720
and of course you can't secure

663
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,000
information unless you know where it is

664
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,130
so this is information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be</font>

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,770
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> handy to the organization in</font>

666
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:40,780
general so if you're if you're looking

667
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,110
to try and sell some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these changes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

668
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:46,570
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like single</font>

669
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,469
instance email like coming up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

670
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:51,550
with a with a data map of some kind

671
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,500
pitch it in all different ways that

672
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">improve security we can reduce cost of</font>

673
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,310
storage and it reduces litigation risk

674
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,770
you can get inside and outside counsel

675
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,970
to get on board and agree they'll twist

676
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,340
some arms and they'll get a lot of these

677
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:08,230
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's</font>

678
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:11,139
jobs a lot easier in the long run but

679
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,490
hey this is a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference</font>

680
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,260
we're not talking to all business

681
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,050
continuity experts here we want to hear

682
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:23,300
very frightening things well we've got

683
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:24,889
some frightening things for you where is

684
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,470
all this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> going when I say</font>

685
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:29,210
production where is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it going to go we</font>

686
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:32,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">already talked about sending all of the</font>

687
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">data to your vendor or your your law</font>

688

<font color="#E5E5E5">firms vendor and so it's going to go</font>

689
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:40,360
there after that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

690
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:44,240
your law firm then it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

692
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,600
their vendor so all of the data that

693
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,100
that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security professionals</font>

695
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,840
and protect is going straight out the

696
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,640
door to organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">trust we don't we don't know anything</font>

698
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,810
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely insecure it</font>

699
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,310
hasn't happened yet but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

700
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:10,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that is a somewhat of a</font>

forebear was the outfit that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

705
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:24,230
was to back up all their email on to

00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,570
well that didn't happen in a litigation

711
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:41,270
context we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happening</font>

738

approach information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security at this</font>

744

firms won't and that's the corporate

749
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,320
defense side of things let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

750
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,030
the plaintiffs attorneys the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:19,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data these are a lot of times</font>

769
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:02,030
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did its extrapolate that out</font>

770
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,320
to a lot of other attorneys and that's

771
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:11,649
kind of what you're dealing with and

772
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:14,989
that's where your data is going right so

773
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:17,299
what about the attitude towards security

774
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:19,790
in general within the leaders<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

775

ediscovery i was up at a certification

777
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:30,469
a certification<font color="#CCCCCC"> in e-discovery asks the</font>

778
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,149
presenter a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very valid question he</font>

779
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">said you know I work for this</font>

780
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:34,659
organization they're very concerned

781
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">about sending</font>

782
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:40,659
our data across state lines to other

783
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,299
places and the response from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trainer</font>

784
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:46,629
in this certification course was well

785
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:48,460
just tell them<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the odds of this</font>

786
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:49,960
vendor getting hacked her about the same

787
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,799
as the law firm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just don't need</font>

788
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to worry about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at all I was I was</font>

789
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:57,069
shocked i mean i had been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quiet the</font>

790
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:59,230
entire time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i couldn't i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't</font>

791
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:01,329
raise my hand up fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to</font>

792
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe</font>

793
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:05,069
had a third party penetration test done

794
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,990
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you send your stuff to a vendor</font>

795
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:09,579
the woman said wow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's</font>

796
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,720
that's a really good idea nobody's

797
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:14,079
nobody's really ever brought that up

798
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,848
before it's it's and this is a person

799
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:21,609
giving certifications in this stuff

800
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:24,280
right so what about these vendors right

801
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:26,529
now I'll leave you all to make the

802
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,240
conclusions about the potential

803
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:32,530
vulnerabilities in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

804
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:35,618
underlying technologies but let's talk

805
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,970
about them a little bit everybody and

806
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:40,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brother right now is coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

807
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,970
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools to review data and</font>

808
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a hot area so great way to make</font>

809
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:47,819
a buck I mean all you're doing is you're

810
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:49,809
making a<font color="#E5E5E5"> front end for a database so</font>

811
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:52,058
what what the law firms and attorneys

812
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:56,349
love and just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody else they</font>

813
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:57,720
love web-based applications you know if

814
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,400
you guys saw the presentation yesterday

815
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:04,000
web applications are just in general

816
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,329
broken a lot of these applications the

817
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,829
vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these tools will they they'll</font>

818
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:11,710
give you an option they'll they'll

819
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:14,470
either host the data for you just

820
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,329
overall very positive thing if you don't

821
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,980
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity there or they'll</font>

822
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:21,309
actually sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you so that you can</font>

823
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">install it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your own stuff so just</font>

824
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:24,400
like with with any<font color="#E5E5E5"> major software</font>

825
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:28,900
application you're going to have a

826
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:32,079
slight lag<font color="#E5E5E5"> before between patches at law</font>

827
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,510
firms so you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some insecure</font>

828
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,720
stuff still hanging out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but but</font>

829
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,160
what about some of these vendors

830
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,910
themselves well they did well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

831
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,750
technologies themselves a lot of them

832
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">are built on</font>

833
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:51,870
sequel or<font color="#E5E5E5"> oracle databases which of</font>

834
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:54,780
course are really easy to secure a lot

835
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:58,080
of firms are tied very tightly with our

836
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:01,770
friends at<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft so it's so they're</font>

837
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,810
part of the very big easy target a lot

838
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,700
of the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> will add some flash to it</font>

839
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:09,330
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> well let's let's add some stuff</font>

840
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">like some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> java components let's let's</font>

841
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,360
have some activex controls in there

842
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,300
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that we require</font>

843
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,770
things like internet explorer 6 to use

844
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,600
this and let that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hang out there</font>

845
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,009
when when these vendors talk about

846
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,380
security because when they're dealing

847
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,870
with law firms they love they love to

848
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,590
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and they say we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

849
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:36,839
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of security that banks have</font>

850
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:39,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">ssl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

851
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm like okay great what else can you</font>

852
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:46,110
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me well it's the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level of</font>

853
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:48,630
security that banks have<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so well so</font>

854
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:53,520
let's let's keep this going a little bit

855
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:56,580
I was um last last August when I got

856
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,860
back from Def Con we had a jeans day at

857
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:02,460
work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took full advantage of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

858
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:06,870
and and wore one of the hacks or shirts

859
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:09,090
bright red<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes you know very kind of out</font>

860
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,940
there in your face and the you know we

861
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:13,320
had some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor up to to</font>

862
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,820
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems</font>

863
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,760
we've been having with the database and

864
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,810
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and specifically we</font>

865
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,630
were having some problems with some

866
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:23,250
specific formats not refreshing enough

867
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,200
and I'm thinking myself full you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font>

868
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,360
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of change the way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apache</font>

869
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,680
approaches individual file format so i

870
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,850
bring this up with the developers and i

871
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,799
said well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you just you know</font>

872
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,500
change this in the canoe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

873
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,030
configuration guy said well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd be what</font>

874
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,160
what web server is that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

875
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:42,220
bashing never heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

876
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's let's push this a little bit</font>

877
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:51,609
further what web server are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

878
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:53,980
using we roll our own then I was so shy

879
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,570
I had no response because I couldn't

880
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,790
understand why in the world you would

881
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:59,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">even want to do that you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may need</font>

882
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,270
security through obscurity is one thing

883
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,740
but if you're having problems with up

884
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:06,910
time I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're you know</font>

885
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:10,950
you're achieving much on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal so</font>

886
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,950
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind of my response</font>

887
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,910
one of the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the very nice things</font>

888
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,820
about being one of the newest members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

889
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,950
my team is that I'm now kind of the

890
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,810
go-to<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy for all the vendors to talk to</font>

891
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,950
you know well I'm busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the new</font>

892
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:29,650
guy so I love asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> them about security</font>

893
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:33,970
and they just give up the goods it's

894
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:36,850
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to one</font>

895
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:39,279
outfit and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said well do you guys do</font>

896
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:42,839
pen tests on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software but before we</font>

897
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,400
buy it or or for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own hosted stuff</font>

898
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,110
the response was well we've heard from

899
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">some clients that have had some</font>

900
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:52,390
penetration tests done that we had some

901
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:53,980
some vulnerabilities but we we fixed

902
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,690
those after they told<font color="#CCCCCC"> us about them and</font>

903
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,700
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do any of that ourselves</font>

904
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,140
so you guys are going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of</font>

905
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,870
test through software i said so you guys

906
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,190
expect me to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

907
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:08,529
security of your software that you're

908
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:11,170
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay for well kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

909
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:15,550
that's interesting so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know once</font>

910
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:18,730
against like that here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another great</font>

911
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:20,410
one same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of setup I say you know</font>

912
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,480
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you brought in somebody to a pen</font>

913
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:25,299
test well this time it was what's a pen

914
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,620
test well you know the concept is you

915
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,270
pay somebody to come in try and break

916
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,330
your stuff and break into it that way

917
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:33,370
you can secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you did too why</font>

918
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:37,900
would we ever have someone come in and

919
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:40,180
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and break our software once again I</font>

920
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:43,030
had very little to say I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font>

921
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:45,819
it's like I guess this this conversation

922
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:49,420
is over at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know where we're</font>

923
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:51,140
going here so here's another great one

924
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,850
for people that

925
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,680
involved in forensics you'll especially

926
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,930
love this or have added any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

927
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,490
involvement with law enforcement talking

928
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:02,180
to this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he comes to my office</font>

929
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:04,899
and we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about security and me</font>

930
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:08,049
coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and speaking at these things</font>

931
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:12,290
he's like yeah you know it's interesting

932
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:14,660
because at our place people send us hard

933
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,850
drives all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time you know we're</font>

934
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,480
processing lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots and lots of</font>

935
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:22,430
data and terabytes of stuff constantly

936
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,750
at no<font color="#CCCCCC"> point of but we ever received any</font>

937
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:28,069
hard drive that's ever been encrypted I

938
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,660
was like well how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you handle</font>

939
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,010
chain of custody abut everything just

940
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,770
kind of gets comes and gets dumped in

941
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mailroom myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what seriously</font>

942
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:42,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're just telling me this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

943
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:46,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope I'll be right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down so let's put</font>

944
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">this even more into perspective lots of</font>

945
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:52,940
big law firms will host all of this data

946
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:55,279
themselves but a lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these vendors</font>

947
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,980
will host it for you but think about it

948
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,500
if you're an attacker looking to steal

949
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:04,310
some trade secrets commit some corporate

950
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:07,280
espionage why would we come to the

951
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:10,700
individual organization at this point

952
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,610
and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go after your security with</font>

953
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:17,270
your dedicated security staff when maybe

954
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,740
we can go and try and attack a vendor so

955
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:22,070
that way instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just getting company</font>

956
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:25,100
aid stuff who knows maybe we'll get b c

957
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:31,880
and d<font color="#CCCCCC"> too it's a field day that's a much</font>

958
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:36,100
bigger target so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion what what</font>

959
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,510
can we do as information technology

960
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:42,049
professionals to deal with some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

961
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:44,900
new issues to try and continue to

962
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect our data try and control costs</font>

963
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:50,960
get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawyers at you know your</font>

964
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:54,560
in-house counsel and if they're around

965
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of your out house counsel get to</font>

966
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">know your lawyers in a friendly way not</font>

967
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:03,250
just by breaking policy and getting in

968
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:06,040
trouble either as a company find your

969
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">catalog it figure out where it is and</font>

970
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:12,320
plan ahead for litigation in this day

971
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,470
and age litigation is a certainty at

972
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,380
some point in a company's<font color="#E5E5E5"> life cycle you</font>

973
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,450
need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plan for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and on the</font>

974
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,180
security and the things you need to

975
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:26,060
demand more from vendors if if if if the

976
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,129
if you guys know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information is</font>

977
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,170
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be going out demand to see</font>

978
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,720
third-party reports demand full

979
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,880
disclosure from them nobody's asking for

980
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,350
this stuff right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and these companies</font>

981
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,000
are certainly not going to give it up

982
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,980
you know otherwise you know depending on

983
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,250
your organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what the culture</font>

984
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,930
is you know it might just be time to get

985
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:53,500
right with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a man and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

986
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:56,210
answer so at that I think I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got about</font>

987
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:00,640
seven minutes or so you guys have any

988
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,640
have any questions for me yeah

989
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:31,769
max 90<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that provide a significant</font>

990
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,140
discovery people<font color="#E5E5E5"> close up upper</font>

991
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:36,299
background and be at that point that

absolutely a document retention policy

1003
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:12,119

here comes the lawyer answers again it

a little bit too short you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

understand the shaping of these policies

1023
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:10,319
so that they can find one that's going

another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that can come up is like</font>

you said exceptions to the rule<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:19,720
I don't know that bid that is that yeah

it I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you know they believe I</font>

courts kind of deal with it that's kind

1052
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,970
of the nice thing about the the rule

1053

changes to the rules of civil procedure

1054
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,080
is that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow a lot of</font>

flexibility between the parties to kind

of come to agreement it kind of depends

00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">on what kind of level of liability</font>

00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,680
much probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's still something</font>

found you with cases Morgan Stanley UBS

1076
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:38,250
got hit real early with a lot of the big

1077
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:41,410
sanctions with the adverse inference

1078
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:45,280
where a lot of this case law really

1079
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:48,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">stemmed from so any and if you guys want</font>

1080
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,960
to know the wrong way to handle things

1081
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:51,670
you know read some of these opinions

1082
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,280
read that there's like five<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zuba</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1083
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:56,620
opinions the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Morgan Stanley opinion</font>

1084
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,480
where where there were thousands of

00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,069
backup tapes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that word that were never</font>

1086
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,140
analyzed and they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a closet</font>

1087
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,820
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they gotten to the point where</font>

1088
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,560
they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what's called the 30</font>

1089
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,300
v6 deposition where they bring in

1090
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,420
somebody high up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT to kind of talk</font>

1091
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:12,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what their structure is and how</font>

1092
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,260
it's setup and the guy said

1093
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,700
unequivocally yes we've just we've gone

1094
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,260
through and we found all the backup

1095
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,120
tapes we produced all the information

1096
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,650
well he goes home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he realizes wow</font>

1097
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,720
that was kind of ridiculous thing for me

1098
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,180
to say

1099
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,890
I guess I better go check maybe see if

1100
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:29,009
there are any other tapes laying around

1101
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:30,118
the first place he looked he found a box

1102
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,369
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup tapes that hadn't been</font>

1103
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,430
produced it only got worse from there

1104
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:36,930
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was that was where there was an</font>

1105
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,399
adverse inference what the adverse

1106
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,680
inference is kind of the worst type of

1107
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,980
sanction for any group going through

1108
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,940
litigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> yets and this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of scary</font>

1109
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:50,609
part for individuals that meant be sued

1110
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:52,530
civilly under federal law is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1111
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:54,960
data is destroyed or it isn't there and

1112
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:58,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> court finds a number of factors</font>

1113
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:02,369
they'll actually tell the jury<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

1114
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:04,950
didn't see any evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this because</font>

1115
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:06,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not there the fact that it's not</font>

1116
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:10,109
there you can hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> that against the</font>

1117
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:12,569
defendant you can assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

1118
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:15,240
plaintiff said is there is there that's

1119
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,500
the death knell to any defendant it's

1120
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,830
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get out the checkbook if that's</font>

1121
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,880
going to happen so that's you know we

1122
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't seen it start tap with</font>

1123
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,810
individuals yet I think I think that's I

1124
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:29,310
think the adverse inference instruction

1125
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:30,779
was given with torrents by which that's

1126
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">also another frightening frightening</font>

1127
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:36,089
case that happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it the</font>

1128
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,300
court essentially set up a judicial

1129
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:40,890
keylogger what was happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

1130
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,130
case is you had all the people

1131
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:45,299
connecting to the bittorrent tracker and

1132
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">torrance by said well we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't keep any</font>

1133
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:52,560
logs and the judge couldn't really force

1134
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,710
them to turn on the logs really so what

1135
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,440
they did was they just required that

1136
00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:03,450
everything that passed through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ram</font>

1137
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:05,609
that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ram to be retained and when</font>

1138
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,200
I read the opinion I had to read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1139
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:09,029
three times before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I realized deed</font>

1140
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,390
before it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> set in that yeah that's</font>

1141
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:14,190
that's a keylogger now that's pretty

1142
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">rare and that was a very special</font>

1143
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:20,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">circumstance the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people at Torrance by</font>

1144
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,910
hadn't exactly been playing nicely with

1145
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,680
the courts or with the other side at all

1146
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:28,618
so we're hoping right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least I'm</font>

1147
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,319
hoping that's a very far out liner but

1148
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,680
you never know when a plaintiff attorney

1149
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,180
is going to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that opinion</font>

1150
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,220
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go to the judge they're</font>

1151
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have a defense attorney that</font>

1152
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,149
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all that savvy and he's you</font>

1153
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,079
know all of a sudden you're going to

1154
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,460
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you need to preserve</font>

1155
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:44,230
everything that was going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM</font>

1156
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:48,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of your machines yet had your</font>

1157
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:50,980
office you know and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end the sad</font>

1158
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:52,930
thing is they won't consult with<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT a</font>

1159
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:56,609
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the times before these orders are</font>

1160
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:59,828
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I've heard that sometimes that</font>

1161
00:51:56,609 --> 00:52:03,609
the transmission of data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor</font>

1162
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:07,119
from the client started without even

1163
00:52:03,609 --> 00:52:08,920
notifying information security so you

1164
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,990
know you've got gigs and gigs and gigs

1165
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,930
of data just streaming out to an unknown

1166
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:15,930
IP address you know might want to tell

1167
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody that this is going to happen so</font>

1168
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:19,680
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions you guys have</font>

1169
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,670
yeah

1170
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:44,180
well that's that's an interesting case

1171
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:45,619
and I get asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> the that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an</font>

1172
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,299
emerging thing because now lawyers are

1173
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:50,090
figuring out that there's the instant

1174
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:53,000
message logs<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to</font>

1175
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,440
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's all in what policy</font>

1176
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,500
works for you guys you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can</font>

1177
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,750
if if you have a policy at the

1178
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:02,660
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that employees are not to</font>

1179
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:04,880
use SMS for business purposes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

1180
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">can show that you don't do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1181
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,630
there's probably there may not be a

1182
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:10,610
reason to keep around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logs but if</font>

1183
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,260
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> relying on that then it needs to</font>

1184
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:21,400
be rolled<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your document retention</font>

1185
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:21,400
policy just like everything else yeah

1186
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:39,140
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is which probably will</font>

1187
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,640
happen at some points everybody in this

1188
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,490
room you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a litigation hold that</font>

1189
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,680
is obscenely broad and possibly even

1190
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:48,259
just physically impossible to comply

1191
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,960
with you know retain all backup tapes

1192
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:54,680
from now until perpetuity something like

1193
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:58,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get ahold</font>

1194
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:00,560
of the in-house counsel and say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1195
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,920
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you we need to get together</font>

1196
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,779
with outside counsel we need to work

1197
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,060
through this preservation<font color="#CCCCCC"> be through</font>

1198
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,859
this hold because<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes you get a</font>

1199
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:12,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">present preservation order from the</font>

1200
00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:15,080
court which is more difficult to change

1201
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:17,090
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a hold that's been sent you</font>

1202
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:20,330
can tell it's kind of a boilerplate form

1203
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:23,030
front in house counsel talk to them find

1204
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:25,240
out what the case is about figure out

1205
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:28,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best way to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1206
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:32,270
attorneys an IT don't really talk very

1207
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:33,650
much I me where<font color="#E5E5E5"> were two opposing worlds</font>

1208
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,900
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all that different</font>

1209
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:37,820
when you get down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it but they just</font>

1210
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't talk and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of times in-house</font>

1211
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,030
counsel just doesn't understand

1212
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:44,180
technology so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to help them</font>

1213
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:47,440
through it educate the attorneys now let

1214
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:49,000
them help them understand the technology

1215
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,170
then hopefully as you go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ang's</font>

1216
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,240
through things they'll help you

1217
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:57,520
understand the law and why you're being

1218
00:54:52,240 --> 00:55:00,509
required to do it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1219
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">right well I thank you all for coming</font>

1220
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,630
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any more questions I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1221
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,630
around all day so thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you again</font>
