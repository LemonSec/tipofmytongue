00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">mornin folks this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where it separates</font>

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,389
the men from the boys I suppose everyone

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,550
either didn't go out and party last

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:23,160
night or I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually ride the</font>

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,510
hangover in here this morning for those

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,250
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did see the show last night</font>

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,900
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys think of it yeah I have to</font>

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,278
admit I was a little little trepidatious

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,730
at first about it and I was pretty happy

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,680
with what I saw but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh we're going to</font>

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,319
ahead and get rolling here with a Diane

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,550
Barrett from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the uat i can remember</font>

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
that's the University of Applied

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,680
Technology right advancing technology

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,210
yeah university of advancing technology

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,320
and she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be speaking about</font>

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,180
doing forensics on virtualized systems

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,500
which may<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem a little esoteric to you</font>

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,920
realize people are actually deploying

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,640
virtualized data centers I'm now seeing

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,210
service access providers now deploying

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,820
virtualized firewalls so they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">know kind of in theory kolos within</font>

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,710
kolos within kolos and everything is all

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,210
virtualized and as a result these

26
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,649
machines are going to get hacked at some

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,229
point and somebody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,240
conduct forensics investigations on them

29
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:25,520
and running forensics investigations on

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,810
virtualized machines is fairly different

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,630
than running forensics on an actual

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">physical asset so Diane's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to walk</font>

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:44,369
you through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things to do</font>

34
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:46,500
that morning happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sunday everybody hear</font>

35
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,780
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm kind of loud</font>

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,640
anyway so if I get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit too loud</font>

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,079
just wave your hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Diane paradigm</font>

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,119
from the university of advancing

39
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,369
technology and this morning I don't

40
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,549
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want is this is not going to be a</font>

41
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,469
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy technical talk what I'm</font>

42
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about is some of the</font>

43
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,899
things that people that investigate

44
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:12,170
computer crimes need to be aware of as

45
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,390
far as where we are

46
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:18,319
with the technologies that are out there

47
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:21,769
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about virtualization a</font>

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,760
couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> back when virtualization</font>

49
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,989
first started becoming popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of</font>

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,280
thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and that kind of</font>

51
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,380
thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to ask just a</font>

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,400
passing fad you know what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

53
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,260
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pay a whole lot of</font>

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,970
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then some of my</font>

55
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,140
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like no no really we're</font>

56
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,870
using this stuff in real life so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

57
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,059
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some of my friends in blue and</font>

58
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:48,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">i asked them about you know what do you</font>

59
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:51,110
do and how do you investigate a virtual

60
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,830
machine and they looked at me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I had</font>

61
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,720
five heads and change the subject so I'm

62
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,080
going ok well maybe really there is

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,100
something to this a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about my</font>

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,080
background I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently a professor at</font>

65
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,380
the university of advancing technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,930
also do a computer forensics work I work

67
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,140
for a contractor a contractor up in

68
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:18,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">Phoenix and what we do is all civil work</font>

69
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,988
we do no criminal work whatsoever we had

70
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,239
one criminal case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved child</font>

71
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,560
porn and it was decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font>

72
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,989
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore that we kind</font>

73
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">of leave that to the law enforcement and</font>

74
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,049
before that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent seven years in</font>

75
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,120
software development I grew up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> das so</font>

76
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:37,579
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a long time I've</font>

77
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,100
watched a lot of software<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve the</font>

78
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:44,390
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we build was really really</font>

79
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:47,450
bad and you couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just burn a CD and</font>

80
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,390
send it out and so what I did was I

81
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,399
spent a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my time going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the</font>

82
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">different companies that we worked with</font>

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,260
and integrated our software into their

84
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,290
environment so that everything would

85
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:04,130
play nice I've evolved quite a bit since

86
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:07,160
then so getting back to virtual

87
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,420
environments I went out and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at</font>

88
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,260
when I start looking at virtual

89
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,589
environments there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were a couple things</font>

90
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:21,310
that I found out there one vendor site

91
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:25,480
says that you can use their software and

92
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:29,500
it won't actually install anything in

93
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:33,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're another vendor says that there is</font>

94
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:39,730
absolutely no information left behind on

95
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the computer believe it no okay</font>

96
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,960
everything to me everything leaves

97
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,720
traces and show a part of what I've done

98
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last year is went through and looked</font>

99
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,180
at a lot of these softwares and looked

100
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,310
at where they leave traces looked at

101
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,950
things that they do a lot of vendors

102
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,380
aren't very forthcoming up with what it

103
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,820
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and there's one</font>

104
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will talk about that just came out</font>

105
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:07,090
a little ways down the road so what I

106
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,760
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over today is number one to</font>

107
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,510
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the methods that are used for</font>

108
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,270
server and desktop virtualization then I

109
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,050
want to talk about how virtualization

110
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,330
actually affects a forensic

111
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,610
investigation and then lastly we're

112
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:28,330
going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the methods that you</font>

113
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:32,170
can use to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find virtual artifacts and be</font>

114
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,789
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify when there are virtual</font>

115
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,240
activities and that's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

116
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:39,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">things about investigations is even</font>

117
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,190
though there might not be processes and

118
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,530
there might not be methods in place but

119
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,660
if you realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

120
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:51,869
that you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at a little</font>

121
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:54,490
closer it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you some ideas</font>

122
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,680
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual market everybody's doing</font>

123
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">it right everything I pick up every</font>

124
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,580
every tech magazine that I pick up

125
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,490
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization</font>

126
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,080
everybody's virtualizing things they

127
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,270
predict that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this came out of</font>

128
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,580
Gartner research Gardner<font color="#CCCCCC"> Research</font>

129
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:15,460
predicts that within three years there

130
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:20,080
will be between 480 million and 846

131
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:24,460
million virtualized pcs it's a lot of

132
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,590
virtualization so and here are some

133
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:32,320
recent examples of virtualization

134
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:36,380
probably about a month ago HP released a

135
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,469
96 terabyte virtual storage device

136
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,040
and this is a virtual array and the

137
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,320
array initializes the virtualization

138
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:48,490
comes up at system initialization so

139
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:53,320
it's already prepped it's ready to go

140
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:57,260
install free install free<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually has a</font>

141
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:01,540
software piece that converts a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

142
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:06,260
desktop into an encrypted virtual

143
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:09,860
machine file it then stores this file on

144
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:13,159
the server somewhere and is downloadable

145
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,350
at any time now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way to go</font>

146
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,050
right do your stuff inside a virtual

147
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,970
machine encrypted stored somewhere pull

148
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,730
it back down whenever you're ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

149
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,980
I don't know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems now in the</font>

150
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:28,220
in the forensic world even trying to

151
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:32,480
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to examine encrypted</font>

152
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:38,710
regular machines how now are we supposed

153
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:42,710
to examine encrypted virtual machines no

154
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:44,060
why any ideas why why why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so</font>

155
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:48,729
much virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there why do we</font>

156
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,730
have so much virtualization any ideas

157
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,940
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> besides that right who is it</font>

158
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:04,219
isn't it I'm AMD is working on a 12 core

159
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:05,810
processor yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I saw something</font>

160
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,670
the other day was reading about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that AMD</font>

161
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,610
is pretty far on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there 12 core processor</font>

162
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,560
so we built this technology that we

163
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,720
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the applications to run on</font>

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">top of and so the best way to take</font>

165
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,910
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hardware is to</font>

166
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,469
virtualize it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go a</font>

167
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,170
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> until</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I told</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you this not a</font>

real real heavy heavy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tech Talk so I'm</font>

169
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to go a whole lot into the</font>

170
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,760
virtual machine environment virtual

171
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,169
virtualization basically is done through

172
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,559
what's considered a hypervisor and

173
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,870
that's just a layer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls how</font>

174
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,500
the access to the computers processors

175
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:44,570
in memory is shared it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a proxy</font>

176
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,860
between the virtual system and the

177
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,600
physical resources

178
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,839
there are different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of hypervisors</font>

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,470
out there you will see what they call

180
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,430
type 1 which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bare metal then you'll</font>

181
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:02,820
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type to some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them actually</font>

182
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,469
are the later right above the hardware

183
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,079
so that it can interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

184
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:10,920
hardware some of them are a layer in

185
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:13,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the installed operating system</font>

186
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,199
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual operating system and</font>

187
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,240
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of information</font>

188
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,570
out there on hypervisors and the type

189
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,019
that there are still currently for

190
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,540
virtual technology players we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

191
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,550
of companies out there these and this

192
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,290
and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is not all of them</font>

193
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,920
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the major ones</font>

194
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,750
that you'll find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there VMware a vm</font>

195
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,399
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like VMware for the simple reason</font>

196
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,560
that it has a virtual appliance

197
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,240
marketplace has anybody been to be

198
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">immersed virtual appliance marketplace</font>

199
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,450
right you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go you download versatile</font>

200
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,070
player you pick what you want you

201
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,230
download it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way you go and it's</font>

202
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,050
wonderful pre-configured appliances and

203
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,000
they have all kinds of appliances they

204
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,380
have firewalls they have routers they

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,140
have all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

206
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,680
download so it's not limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

207
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:04,079
operating systems and besides the

208
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,680
virtual planes mark a place they do also

209
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,680
yes sir

210
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:21,180
yeah it's pretty cool huh it is and

211
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:24,060
besides the besides the appliance

212
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,689
marketplace they do also offer server

213
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,359
and desktop technologies as well

214
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,670
microsoft microsoft has server and

215
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,250
desktop technologies as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

216
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:39,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">their server 2008 they have now created</font>

217
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:42,889
their own hypervisor called hyper-v

218
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:45,139
parallels parallels is meant for

219
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:49,050
macintosh operating systems and

220
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:51,630
parallels has a marketplace similar to

221
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">vmware except i think they probably have</font>

222
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,189
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh about three hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appliances</font>

223
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,320
or so whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMware probably has close</font>

224
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,610
to a thousand so parallels is very

225
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,260
similar to vm aware i'm in that it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

226
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:07,670
virtual appliance marketplace as well

227
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,250
and it does offer other technologies

228
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:14,069
servers desktops that kind of thing

229
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,260
citrix citrix just bought then and they

230
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:20,790
have their hypervisor is called then

231
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">express and i think it was in november</font>

232
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:27,149
november of last year son bought

233

236
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,760
runs on just about anything so it will

237
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,100
run on Windows Linux of different kinds

238
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,269
now realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> to with the lawd with a lot</font>

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:50,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies some of them you</font>

00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:05,359
are you having to any of you having

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay what other kind of issues besides</font>

247
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,860
performance might you find

248
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:32,610
hardware issues that hardware issues is

249
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,639
a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tell you what trying to</font>

250
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,800
get some drives to work with a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

251
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,269
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> load all right trying to get some</font>

252
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,819
types of work with a lot of the virtual

253
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,319
environments is just about crazy and we

254
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,939
tried all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of things I mean we</font>

255
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:47,849
tried there are those they're like

256
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:49,230
virtual some drives that you can

257
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,790
actually you're supposed to download the

258
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,800
application it allows you to use the

259
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,599
thumb drive in and we had some issues

260
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,300
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you is that</font>

261
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,009
we had um yeah at the University

262
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,628
periodically they<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed my hardware</font>

263
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:03,240
and we have I had a really really bad

264
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,709
hardware experience last semester and so

265
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,300
I have a lab and all the hardware

266
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be standardized I've had</font>

267
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,628
like four different motherboards and I

268
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,099
don't know how many different kind of

269
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:13,680
memories the machines had memory mix

270
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,110
anyway what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do I used</font>

271
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,899
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization and we we had to</font>

272
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,970
drive that we had VirtualBox on and

273
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:23,249
there was something in the hardware that

274
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,689
it did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like virtual box and so every</font>

275
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:26,850
time I opened a browser the machine just

276
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:28,740
automatically budut itself and I mean

277
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,180
you know it which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> odd that you</font>

278
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,069
know that opening a browser would cause

279
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,899
that to happen and it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox</font>

280
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:38,910
it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> ie so it was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

281
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that process that caused the the</font>

282
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,300
hard we're gonna go I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

283
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,309
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this into this and then it</font>

284
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,839
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just reboot itself so you end up</font>

285
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:48,059
you do end up having some hardware

286
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,879
issues as well but as fertilization

287
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:54,120
advances I'm sure that will fix that and

288
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,550
that we won't have those those kind of

289
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,220
issues all right virtualization of

290
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,378
phones ok we heard a lot whole lot about

291
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,899
phones the last couple days in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

292
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Motorola and Motorola it's not the only</font>

293
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,220
company that's working with virtual

294
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,449
logic I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Cisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

295
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,370
a couple other companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

296
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,109
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them as well but what</font>

297
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,749
they're doing is they want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> in bed</font>

298
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,809
it virtual machines so that you can have

299
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">one phone that runs any kind of app that</font>

300
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:22,469
you want mm-hmm and all you doing next

301
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,139
up is I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what built on the</font>

302
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,379
sim it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's all built on the</font>

303
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,379
sim

304
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,190
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I residents built on the</font>

305
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">scent but anyway so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really a</font>

306
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,080
pretty pretty cool thing to now realize

307
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,890
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my standpoint of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view a lot of</font>

308
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:43,070
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like nightmarish for me ok</font>

309
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">do one cell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phone and PDA forensics in</font>

310
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:49,430
itself is hard enough I mean you don't

311
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,290
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> redo</font>

312
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:57,290
this what<font color="#E5E5E5"> were what was i was working</font>

313
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:59,030
with up a phone that had was it see with

314
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,829
a/c II but it was there there was some

315
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,560
kind of incompatibility between the

316
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,810
phone and the operating system and I

317
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,689
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even get an image off the phone</font>

318
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now we're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about embedding</font>

319
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,710
virtual machines and I'm going oh my god

320
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,969
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how I'm gonna deal with</font>

321
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:18,260
this stuff anyway virtual boxes have any

322
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,840
of you seen those no virtue of boxes

323
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay pan always one</font>

324
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,560
panel makes this and and I think

325
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably the reason why people like this</font>

326
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,619
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're very sexy-looking</font>

327
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,740
there are these little square silver

328
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,020
boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now they have no supposing</font>

329
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,480
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing in them they have USB</font>

330
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,699
ports that allows a user to plug in

331
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:43,130
their keyboard the mouse their monitor

332
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:45,590
and then that little<font color="#E5E5E5"> box hooks them into</font>

333
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,450
a virtual and panel only works with

334
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:52,550
Microsoft products so currently it will

335
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:55,780
only work with um XP and Vista I believe

336
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,780
in yes sir

337
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:04,209
you know is probably based a lot unlike

338
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,540
our DP and stuff like that and because

339
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:11,619
there are different protocols there's um

340
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:14,050
approach right it's hosted data right

341
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,459
it's not all the boxes the box is kinda

342
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,740
it's almost like a dumb terminal the box

343
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:20,800
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes doing is just acting as a</font>

344
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,170
communicator between those devices and

345
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,290
the vert and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

346
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron the virtual machine okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

347
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,769
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> panel is not the only one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font>

348
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,689
these about pano probably is the first

349
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:36,370
company who developed these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was on one</font>

350
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,920
was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago last month I</font>

351
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:43,000
was at a was strictly a university a

352
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,399
presentation and there was a guy that

353
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,990
had one it was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was similar in the pan</font>

354
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,160
know but it wasn't made by pan or so

355
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:58,029
there's other companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are coming</font>

356
00:16:48,160 --> 00:17:01,930
out with that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but was it sexy</font>

357
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:03,610
looking I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what self a lot</font>

358
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,500
of it is it's this place nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

359
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,209
silver box you don't people go I don't

360
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,069
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> this up because you got to realize</font>

361
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for people that want to</font>

362
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">move to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing to get your</font>

363
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,819
users to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it is really gonna be</font>

364
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:19,799
hard they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up those</font>

365
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:19,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">big boxes they have you know</font>

366
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,070
right that's right there you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

367
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">them and so in order to sell them they</font>

368
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,210
oh look at this it's a nice sexy little

369
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,620
box it looks good you know look how good

370
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,960
it looks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your desktop and so they</font>

371
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,668
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> made them so that they can sell</font>

372
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to the user environment because</font>

373
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,780
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a hard sell and then</font>

374
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,720
there's another inboxer makes this

375
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,970
virtual appliances called an anti risk

376
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,789
virtual appliance and they're pretty

377
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:56,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">much trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to market that to a lot of</font>

378
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:57,799
companies for compliance reasons and so

379
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:00,350
what they want for that it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

380
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,668
what we do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can filter email we can</font>

381
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">look through emails coming through and</font>

382
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:06,169
we can tell you if anything that's going

383
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,730
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your company is sexually</font>

384
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,200
harassing we can tell whether you're

385
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,230
complying with hip but we can tell

386
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,200
whether you're complying with pii those

387
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,510
kind of things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again it's it they</font>

388
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,200
call it an anti risk virtual appliance

389
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:25,400
and that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate software however</font>

390
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,049
it does work with VMware as well so I

391
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,480
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have interfaces that</font>

392
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:32,929
allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use other virtualization</font>

393
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:37,669
options then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have virtual</font>

394
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:41,480
applications ok we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMware</font>

395
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:45,080
recently bought thin stall and with

396
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:49,940
install thin stall basically is streamed

397
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:53,809
virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> acts however with this there's</font>

398
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to tell what users are using the</font>

399
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:58,428
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you're like well</font>

400
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,289
okay who's using the app we don't know

401
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,570
all we know is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going out there</font>

402
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:06,250
somewhere and the venue there's another

403
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:10,399
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does spice protocol and</font>

404
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:12,559
that is streamed as well you know mojo

405
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,049
pack which we'll talk about in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

406
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,520
bit mojo pack is an individually

407
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:18,520
contained yes sir

408
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom of your virtual classes</font>

409
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:31,040
virtual registry<font color="#CCCCCC"> no this this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just in</font>

410
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,150
and we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

411
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,790
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it because some of them are</font>

412
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:37,250
actual virtual containers this is not an

413
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,960
actual virtual container this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

414
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,940
streaming application so in other words

415
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,740
what may happen is that you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

416
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,480
instance and let's just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

417
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,280
who was it that into doing it there's a

418
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,500
company out there that's doing it it's a

419
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">financial company and what they have is</font>

420
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,480
they have a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of virtual</font>

421
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,370
virtual machines if they made for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

422
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,990
operating systems and show what may

423
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,570
happen is the user may come in and say

424
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:03,860
well okay you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login and I get XP</font>

425
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:05,899
now I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use um office and you know</font>

426
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,429
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though it you know it technically</font>

427
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,010
should be pre-installed in that virtual

428
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,260
machine what they do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have the</font>

429
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,570
applications may be on separate servers

430
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,490
where they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stream that application</font>

431
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,899
as they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

432
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a service is how a lot that works</font>

433
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the next thing is we're going to</font>

434
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that's used for</font>

435
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:29,030
individual environments mojo pack mojo

436
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,700
Pratt probably was one of the first

437
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,830
virtual environments that there is and I

438
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,160
have mojo pack on here I have it up and

439
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:40,580
running there's the actual environment

440
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,930
itself will talk about virtual traces

441
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,929
and we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about this</font>

442
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:48,350
however how how this works is this is

443
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">installed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a thumb drive and you plug</font>

444
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,219
in the thumb drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the environment</font>

445
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,710
comes up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually is a virtual</font>

446
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,440
XP environment so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went here to my</font>

447
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:01,190
Start menu and I did this start menu you

448
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,320
see I have all my applications here so I

449
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,690
can technically I can if I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

450
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,399
can install office in mojo pack and I

451
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,070
can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have office installed on the</font>

452
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,030
host machine so that you can actually

453
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:17,419
have two sets of applications running on

454
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:20,300
the same machine one off the thumb drive

455
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then one on the host machine itself</font>

456
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,760
now realize with that said realize that

457
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:29,890
you need a licensing for both those

458
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,890
installs you can't share them

459
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:39,190
yeah yeah this is this is the company

460
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,600
that does this is instruction XP I have

461
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,639
this on one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those working micro</font>

462
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,840
drives and I have a bunch of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

463
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:45,340
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> because one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too that</font>

464
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,559
I like to use because I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

465
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,879
bit mean and for my classes a lot of

466
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,470
times what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll do is I'll give them an</font>

467
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,409
image and it'll be a multi-pack image

468
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:56,019
and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but where's like</font>

469
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:58,570
all the install files you know because

470
00:21:56,019 --> 00:22:00,759
it has it has its own registry however

471
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,139
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full windows install and so</font>

472
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:10,720
when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> start going in there you look</font>

473
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:13,629
at the ziggo what is this it's just an

474
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,110
application it doesn't use yeah it

475
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:19,870
doesn't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware um and I just have so</font>

476
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,899
much it has it<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it uses a lot of the</font>

477
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,428
host operating resources yeah so it's

478
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,939
it's own application but it does use a

479
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:30,129
lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host off the host resources</font>

480
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so getting into that van only see</font>

481
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:34,480
can I escape under this I'm gonna switch

482
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:41,049
to my host<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay switch back to my host</font>

483
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:42,970
and back to where we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so</font>

484
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:45,429
that's no jet pack the next one is

485
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,600
mobile five and I have mocha five and

486
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:50,049
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with this I'm just</font>

487
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you the basic interface to</font>

488
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:54,490
it i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to start it up and i</font>

489
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,740
like mocha five because and actually

490
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,379
they've just they've redone it a little

491
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,269
bit but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> moka fide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> creator one of</font>

492
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:03,699
the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> things about this is you can</font>

493
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:06,129
actually you go when you download live

494
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,590
pcs from their site so it was kind of

495
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:11,408
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMware or parallels except</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

496
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,870
running up a thumb drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it has</font>

497
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:15,490
fearless browser okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> fear does browser</font>

498
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,658
that little turtle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you saw in you</font>

499
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,149
know in that slide that I have when you

500
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:21,789
start that up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all runs out</font>

501
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:23,500
virtual player so this actually is vm

502
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,970
that runs up a virtual player so you

503
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,460
have fearless browser and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

504
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,470
downloaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DSL because I wanted to</font>

505
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,240
have some other on some other pcs on

506
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,340
here but down on the bottom of the area

507
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,799
see where it says add live pcs you can

508
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,870
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can add live pcs so</font>

509
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,590
you can either<font color="#CCCCCC"> download new life pcs</font>

510
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,229
from their website or

511
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,299
you going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

512
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:48,710
really cool so I like I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that about</font>

513
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:54,139
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> mocha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let me see</font>

514
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:57,559
where am I here now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> close this up</font>

515
00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:00,710
here go back to the presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

516
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:04,070
that's mochel<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 there we go alright next</font>

517
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:08,090
is portable virtual privacy machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

518
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:11,570
and this is done by<font color="#E5E5E5"> metro pipe this is a</font>

519
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:14,389
dsl and it's designed to boot from a USB

520
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Drive so you download it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the USB</font>

521
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,080
drive you plug it into the Machine and

522
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:21,439
you actually boot right from it and it

523
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,889
boots in to the operating system<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself</font>

524
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,770
and its DF<font color="#CCCCCC"> its dia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's based up to</font>

525
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:32,390
yourself but it uses qemu so it doesn't

526
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:34,190
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware or anything like that the</font>

527
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,990
next one of course is your VMware Player

528
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,450
environments and this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

529
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,179
favorites backtrack to with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vettes boy 3</font>

530
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay just go you download it and you can</font>

531
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,110
do whatever you want with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call</font>

532
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,678
it the ethical hacker network no no it's

533
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,059
got a lot of cool toys on it though<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

534
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,409
so yeah so I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mess around this</font>

535
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,270
but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the VMware Player</font>

536
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:54,679
environments for those of you who have

537
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,720
not ever messed around with that is

538
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">icici</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just download it you download via</font>

539
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,299
more player you download the appliance

540
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,730
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want and away you go okay so we have</font>

541
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the spiritualization stuff after we</font>

542
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,380
have all these people doing all kinds of

543
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,380
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have applications we have</font>

544
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:15,140
operating systems and we have all kind

545
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,940
of hypervisors late last year the

546
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">distributive manage management task</font>

547
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,850
force they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> created an open</font>

548
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,669
standard and what this does is this

549
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:29,209
creates a standard for developers to

550
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:32,899
work on discovering managing the life

551
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:35,779
cycles controlling virtual resources and

552
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:36,860
monitoring virtual systems so we

553
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have</font>

554
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:42,139
some type of standard out there for

555
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,510
managing the life cycles of virtual

556
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,190
machines and I read an article<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too</font>

557
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,600
long ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was called the virtual</font>

558
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,120
machine gravy already mean how many

559
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,610
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually create virtual machines</font>

560
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,469
or virtual environments and then they

561
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,419
blow them away for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reason and what</font>

562
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,160
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do with them you know they're</font>

563
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,590
like all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

564
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,870
these these virtual machine graveyards

565
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,549
all over the place that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes people</font>

566
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,549
aren't even aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're out there</font>

567
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,630
well it kind of would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like let's just</font>

568
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:16,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">say for example that I made a I made a</font>

569
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,220
virtual machine for myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and XP and</font>

570
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,200
then I decided that I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

571
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,140
it or I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to use it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

572
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,290
created another virtual machine that I

573
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,299
used a version of Linux that I used

574
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:32,000
ubuntu because I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that better well</font>

575
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,350
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't delete that XP</font>

576
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,390
machine I'm not going to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore</font>

577
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,360
and the way that virtual machines they

578
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,250
store as a file just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one file extension</font>

579
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,689
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a whole operating system so</font>

580
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:46,780
sometimes you might find like a bunch of

581
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">vh DS or vm decays around on a system</font>

582
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,530
why and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens to a lot of times</font>

583
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,820
people don't reclaim until they run out

584
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,530
of space there going oh we don't have

585
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,510
any space ball I<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't look at this like</font>

586
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,950
I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff I mean you know a lot</font>

587
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,320
of network administrators while doctors

588
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,910
are no better than the normal user you

589
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,200
know you got stuff all over this all

590
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:12,630
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place as long as you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

591
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,070
space for who cares mmm we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

592
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about data retention policies up</font>

593
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,450
with VM with VM applications like way at

594
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:23,190
the end because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's a big big</font>

595
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">big issue so okay so how does this</font>

596
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,750
affect forensics why should forensics

597
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,850
people care about this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font>

598
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,320
quote came from microsoft it came right

599
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,320
off microsoft site and it was about

600
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">their virtual technology the idea that</font>

601
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:42,389
you can make pools of dynamic resources

602
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:46,020
with unlimited capacity available to

603
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:50,750
users anywhere at any time it's

604
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:55,049
extraordinary okay do we have issues if

605
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to allow dynamic resources</font>

606
00:27:55,049 --> 00:28:02,280
with unlimited capacity to be available

607
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:05,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to users anywhere at any time how am I</font>

608
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:08,309
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what you were doing</font>

609
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,990
how am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out where</font>

610
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:16,649
you've been so and we do have not that

611
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:19,559
we don't have forensic means because

612
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,559
network forensics and let me say that

613
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">network forensics will catch most of</font>

614
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,590
this stuff if you're doing live

615
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:30,780
forensics it's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> however a lot</font>

616
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:34,678
of lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and a lot of people</font>

617
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">still do the hard drive imaging I mean</font>

618
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:41,760
the company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for if we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

619
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:44,490
case that involves 2232 drives mark

620
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,160
flies around the country and images

621
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,590
those drives and we bring them back and

622
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,020
we build cases out of them and we

623
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,870
analyze them and that's the way that a

624
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,850
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> forensic companies work it's very</font>

625
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:00,090
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I cannot for the life of me I</font>

626
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,980
cannot get him<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life forensics</font>

627
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,300
yeah he'll update all the machines to

628
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,100
this

629
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,139
or a new operating system as soon as it

630
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,610
comes out not knowing what the issues

631
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,980
may cross for day that we put on those

632
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:12,379
issues however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot get him to go to</font>

633
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,480
live forensics because he is of the mind

634
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,750
said that you know when you go to court

635
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,330
there still may be issues with the

636
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,850
procedures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're using to do live</font>

637
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,500
forensics and so he likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know this</font>

638
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,209
is tried and true methods these are

639
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">tried-and-true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> methods might you know</font>

640
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,880
the stuffs not going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

641
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,430
decor and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the way that we're</font>

642
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,900
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that's what that you know</font>

643
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,000
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the main issues that it</font>

644
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,650
presents so you have mobile employees

645
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,120
now so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means is this</font>

646
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,280
means that i can leave my<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware</font>

647
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,350
behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all i need to take with me</font>

648
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,899
is and i have and i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for a sec</font>

649
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:46,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">pro am I don't mocha my job hunt yeah</font>

650
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,640
mojo pack is going to scream when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

651
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:51,830
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's okay this little thing</font>

652
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,540
right here right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how many of you</font>

653
00:29:51,830 --> 00:30:00,010
have these this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is for gig it</font>

654
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:04,850
compresses to 12 oh yeah whatever right

655
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:06,560
yeah so um yeah yeah and it and what

656
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,840
happens with this is and they make these

657
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,730
they make these all the way they I mean

658
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,990
I got this a long long time ago i got

659
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,790
this probably close to a year ago this

660
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for gig but i mean even with four gig</font>

661
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,180
i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> install the virtual operating</font>

662
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,790
system on it and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that I</font>

663
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,930
need no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the other</font>

664
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,490
one that i have us a little bit bigger

665
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:25,580
but i think i have three virtual

666
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:28,790
operating systems running on it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

667
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,320
know um anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> so something this size is</font>

668
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,360
easy enough for some you carry it also

669
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,010
does i'll present other issues is well

670
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,229
too though because if you're carrying

671
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,660
around confidential data on this little

672
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece here then you end up with bigger</font>

673
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,170
problems because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

674
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,790
easy to lose you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i always make</font>

675
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,260
jokes about it the case for this is a

676
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,330
little pink<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's got this</font>

677
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,379
really long keychain thing on it and you

678
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,100
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make earrings out of mine</font>

679
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:55,280
so I know I won't lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but anyway</font>

680
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:58,370
so um I'm used to doing you to go back

681
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay no she have users users can carry</font>

682
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:03,020
their environments with them so there

683
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,310
may be very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> traces love so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

684
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,170
get this straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to push</font>

685
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,850
him in an in a networked environment

686
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:11,180
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to push out virtual</font>

687
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:13,219
operating systems from the server acts

688
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,560
are going to be serviced as needed so

689
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,590
now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have desktops as a</font>

690
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,830
service okay at the end of the day what

691
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:28,820
happens every singles what right<font color="#CCCCCC"> do they</font>

692
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:30,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">encompass with all right so traditional</font>

693
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,929
methods now are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be enough</font>

694
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:36,200
to find evidence in this kind of

695
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:38,300
environment in the environments that I

696
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,180
showed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're browsing and your</font>

697
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,840
multimedia history stayed<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

698
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:48,050
virtual machine so there may be very few

699
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,199
traces that are left on the host PC if

700
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:53,149
there even is a host PC because by the

701
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,760
time you get to it it's an investigator

702
00:31:53,150 --> 00:32:00,710
there may not be a host PC and they have

703
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">been deleted right right what did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

704
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,510
well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know you're using</font>

705
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,580
you know our DP or whatever it is that

706
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,710
you're using and so you end up having

707
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,949
some you really end up having some

708
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:16,250
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we're going to talk</font>

709
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:20,150
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some traces some traces that</font>

710
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:24,440
you'll find from some of the systems

711
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:26,870
that I've showed you mojo cat mojo pack

712
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,300
when you start up mojo cock and you

713
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,399
first log into it the first thing is it

714
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,820
has this nice little menu that comes up

715
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:37,820
and it says oh do you want to copy all

716
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:40,720
your personal documents and your

717
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:44,668
personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> items to the drive</font>

718
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:49,990
which you can do okay if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm copying</font>

719
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:53,620
from host to USB am I<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to find</font>

720
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">mr use am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find copies I'm</font>

721
00:32:53,620 --> 00:33:00,340
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence that stuff has</font>

722
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:02,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">been copied now one of the things about</font>

723
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,720
mojo pipe is an access to the hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive</font>

724
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:08,020
itself access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the c drive is</font>

725
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,309
eliminated once you actually start the

726
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,480
environment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i probably should just</font>

727
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:14,049
showed you that before I so rudely

728
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,120
pulled it out of the slot but the hard

729
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:19,330
drive itself you can not access however

730
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,309
you can still access the CD wrong and

731
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,889
other drives as well so the only thing

732
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:27,399
it does do is it doesn't allow you to

733
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:29,169
actually access the c drive it needs

734
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,850
administrative rights to run on the host

735
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:32,169
machine so if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

736
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:35,219
administrative rights on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

737
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:38,200
machine you can't use mojo pack unless

738
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:44,230
you install their application called

739
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:46,539
usher usher allows you to use mojo pack

740
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,780
in a limited capacity where you don't

741
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:52,470
need administrative rights however<font color="#E5E5E5"> Usher</font>

742
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:59,530
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be installed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host machine</font>

743
00:33:52,470 --> 00:34:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so here huh as an administrator so</font>

744
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:05,340
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the theory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind that</font>

745
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,069
for mojo pack is that you can allow

746
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:12,819
users to use mojo path in a limited

747
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:14,800
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> see because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

748
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,389
when mojo<font color="#CCCCCC"> pet first came out well mojo</font>

749
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,179
pack first came out it was meant for the

750
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,830
everyday user and now they've gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

751
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,179
the enterprise and that's why they came

752
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,040
out with Usher you know cuz people are

753
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:25,359
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a big problem I don't</font>

754
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,589
want to have users have an admin rights

755
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,759
on their machine so they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

756
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:29,649
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what will give you this app</font>

757
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,030
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh sure you install this and then</font>

758
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:34,299
the user can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it and they don't need</font>

759
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:37,210
to have admin rights and it currently

760
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,980
currently only runs on XP so if you're

761
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,990
using vista or you're using anything

762
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,990
else mojo packs not going to run

763
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:50,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay mojo pack has its own separate</font>

764
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:53,560
registry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she'll if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you install it</font>

765
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:56,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you look at what's on here after</font>

766
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:59,890
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it has a small registry and</font>

767
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:01,689
it had to shell but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

768
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,819
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things to that you'll</font>

769
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,070
find about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of these virtual</font>

770
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,470
environments currently that are running

771
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:12,310
off thumb drives is the thumb drives

772
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:15,100
themselves and the capacity are not

773
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:18,370
powerful enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one those</font>

774
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:21,430
applications sufficiently until de uses

775
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:23,080
a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts resources and the</font>

776
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mojo pack that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed you i think it's</font>

777
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second version of it the first</font>

778
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:31,420
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it was so slow it was</font>

779
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,830
horrible and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our gig</font>

780
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,500
of ram in this machine so it's not like

781
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:39,250
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really heavy duty use machine but i'll</font>

782
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you it like took forever for it to</font>

783
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,630
load the user profile and lo the system

784
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:46,720
files and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going my god i don't know</font>

785
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:49,930
how anybody could even use this and so

786
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,270
with the second version of it they made

787
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:54,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">it a little bit better however it</font>

788
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:57,610
implements paging between memory and the

789
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,710
hard drive to take place on the host pc

790
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:02,710
instead of the portable instead of the

791
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:05,200
portable drive itself so with that said

792
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,270
if you're looking for remnants of mojo

793
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,490
pack you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at your page</font>

794
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,870
file and probably your memory processes

795
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,330
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think later on today somebody's</font>

796
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:16,930
doing a forensic presentation on memory

797
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:19,720
right yeah yeah oh I would see them

798
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:22,240
anyway the other thing too is that the

799
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:26,560
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it runs is ring three main</font>

800
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:30,640
win32 and that's named after the company

801
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,320
that makes it it also phones home the

802
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,609
minute it starts up at phones home and

803
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">it goes hey are there any update</font>

804
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:39,710
there for me i<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's new</font>

805
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:42,470
stuff so it phones home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

806
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:45,170
thing is is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through and I</font>

807
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,509
looked at everything on my sister and

808
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,799
get and I I'm done and I've had my

809
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:51,349
students tell me with this do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

810
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:55,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm trying to figure out the differences</font>

811
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:59,779
between these systems and it stores a

812
00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">pvm okay which is a virtual machines at</font>

813
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:05,809
sis file and it also stores the icon on

814
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:08,029
the host machine so if nothing else if

815
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,890
nothing else<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will at least find</font>

816
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:11,989
these two files and you find these two

817
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,640
files you go well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

818
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:17,029
probably look at other stuff because

819
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:22,640
obviously somebody was using mojo pack

820
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:24,650
on this machine mocha 5 multiplied is

821
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,379
going to leave stuff all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

822
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:30,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">just by virtue of its nature for the</font>

823
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:36,849
simple reason that it uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> vmware player</font>

824
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:39,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one when you shut it down</font>

825
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:41,059
when you go to shut down that virtual

826
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:42,650
machine it seems the virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> state but</font>

827
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:45,049
the first thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

828
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go hey you know what it's going</font>

829
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:51,440
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot easier the next time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I start</font>

830
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:52,940
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you leave this stuff installed so do</font>

831
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to leave via more player</font>

832
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,849
installed so you have the choice of

833
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:00,829
leaving VMware Player installed or not

834
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:05,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it also streams and pre fetches the</font>

835
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:08,599
live pcs if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your my documents</font>

836
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:11,509
after you've used<font color="#E5E5E5"> loca five you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

837
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,489
to find at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> three folders that it</font>

838
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:16,279
creates in there that it doesn't take

839
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:19,279
with it when you unplug it and it's my

840
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:22,099
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcs my life pc documents and</font>

841
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:26,029
there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it creates three</font>

842
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:28,549
very distinct folders that all have live

843
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:30,920
pc and then

844
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:33,549
of course if you didn't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

845
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">were looking for Microsoft has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

846
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:39,170
life stuff out there right so you might

847
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I won't maybe did you sir was just</font>

848
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:46,459
using some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of Michael's on bluff</font>

849
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:49,219
application all right I'm session

850
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:52,009
changes session changes are captured in

851
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:55,640
separate file systems on a ramdisk and

852
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:57,769
again mocha five phones home the first

853
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,170
thing it does when it starts up is it

854
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:02,839
goes out and since hey is there new

855
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,150
stuff out there for me and I hadn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> hide</font>

856
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:07,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in for a long time probably about</font>

857
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,229
man about a month or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and last month I</font>

858
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,788
went in to update it and it like took

859
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:12,769
forever because it had all kind of new

860
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:14,390
stuff and they had I'm a new version of

861
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the app and so that's the other thing</font>

862
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:20,420
too is it phones home and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it updates a</font>

863
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:22,549
lot of it's tough now both mojo pakka

866
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:31,539
that's provided that you catch the

looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this stuff go through and</font>

873
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:58,489
look in the temporary file look in your

874
00:39:55,749 --> 00:40:01,308

875
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:05,329
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still remain in the</font>

dsl and qemu however we found for some

882
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:29,779
reason that once it started up it makes

883

some changes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NT user dot dot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

whether they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font>

so in a live investigation than you

would on a on a dead drive and again it

918

also has a process that was started and

it starts with the start vm parameter so

920
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,090
again with those as far as what you

921
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:21,540
would find on the dead drive you might

922

you're doing a live investigation and

959

994
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,089
users or on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rampant and not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

995
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,618
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of policy you know and in the</font>

996
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:19,839
policies you really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spell out</font>

997
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:22,150
who can use them under what conditions

998
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,529
you know and speaking of encryption I

999
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:26,049
mean one of the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> things for you to</font>

1000
00:46:23,529 --> 00:46:27,999
do is that is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the for the</font>

1001
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:31,029
corporation themselves to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1002
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:34,238
drives encrypt them and then issue them

1003
00:46:31,029 --> 00:46:37,539
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> only allow access based on that</font>

1004
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,859
issuing ID or that device ID so you know

1005
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:40,960
but that all has to be spelled out in

1006
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:42,910
your group policies the other thing too

1007
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,829
is that because a lot of these

1008
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:52,229
applications use the host operating

1009
00:46:46,829 --> 00:46:54,940
system and they use the host resources a

1010
00:46:52,229 --> 00:46:57,700
lot of your application layer security

1011
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:59,769
stuff can probably track this you know

1012
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,569
you might have logs that will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1013
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:03,700
this you know this user was here this

1014
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:05,319
user did this so in a corporate

1015
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,640
environment it might be a little bit

1016
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:12,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier to UM find in a home environment</font>

1017
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,279
those of you that actually have to seize

1018
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:18,640
anything from a home environment and

1019
00:47:15,279 --> 00:47:21,880
they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examined very carefully</font>

1020
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,950
I mean something<font color="#E5E5E5"> this size I could put</font>

1021
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,569
in my mouth and swallow very easily I

1022
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,519
mean I could stick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my hair you'd</font>

1023
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:34,180
never know what was there you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1024
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:35,919
mean those those uh those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1025
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:38,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know we make things so small now</font>

1026
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,690
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reading the case the</font>

1027
00:47:38,049 --> 00:47:44,979
other day where somebody had a bunch of

1028
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:47,529
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not says some unsavory</font>

1029
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:49,269
material on a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small drives like</font>

1030
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:52,180
this and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> took a pack of juicy fruit</font>

1031
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:54,788
and they unwrapped all the gum and they

1032
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,640
put all these inside the little foils

1033
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:59,109
and they put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in the pack of gum</font>

1034
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok if you're seasoned stuff in a home</font>

1035
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:02,830
environment and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you going to do</font>

1036
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:06,669
seize the gum the mins

1037
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:09,370
everything I mean come on but you know

1038
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:11,170
it does happen people find ways to hide

1039
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:13,450
stuff that they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

1040
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,190
and what this making device is smaller

1041
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:23,740
and smaller it just makes it that much

1042
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:25,510
easier right right right because a lot

1043
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,120
of times we get stuff and it's like well

1044
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:30,370
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Drive well okay</font>

1045
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,569
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there nothing on this drive is it</font>

1046
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,940
because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking in the right</font>

1047
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,040
places is it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff's odd</font>

1048
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:39,130
that the stuff was it was you it was

1049
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,509
accessed elsewhere I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1050
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,890
that's what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen a lot of</font>

1051
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,970
forensic investigations and people are

1052
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,319
gonna start looking this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arthur could go</font>

1053
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:49,569
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you know there's nothing here</font>

1054
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:53,050
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy's guilty as sin where's</font>

1055
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:54,370
the stuff you know so so a lot of it is

1056
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,890
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your right you know no one were</font>

1057
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:58,750
to look in that and that kind of thing

1058
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:03,970
how am i doing on time my clothes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1059
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:06,130
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware the virtual</font>

1060
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:07,209
machines basically are and this is and

1061
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,560
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're talking to earlier</font>

1062
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,720
that you had asked about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a lot</font>

1063
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">of virtual machines their applications</font>

1064
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,950
registries and other components<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1065
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,810
they're bundled into will into one

1066
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,970
single file and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so part of the problem</font>

1067
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:27,430
with forensics is that forensic software

1068
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:30,220
can't look at these files there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1069
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:31,720
and believe you me i try i looked at you

1070
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">know and i'll tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i tried some</font>

1071
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,549
very calm I mean I have ways to do it

1072
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:38,080
that is like so convoluted that if I

1073
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:40,690
ever had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain in a court of law</font>

1074
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,759
they go what were you thinking but

1075
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,230
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the only way to get the</font>

1076
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,570
stuff you got to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from here to here</font>

1077
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,950
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to here because when in a normal</font>

1078
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,390
investigation if you need to send

1079
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,799
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the attorney all you do is</font>

1080
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:53,230
you go okay here's the doc file you

1081
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,760
export it you know you zip it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1082
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,960
send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and hopefully they have</font>

1083
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,460
word on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their machine that they can</font>

1084
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,240
examine it with the virtual machine

1085
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:02,710
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one if you export it how you can</font>

1086
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,810
open it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open it you</font>

1087
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,910
change access times you change stuff

1088
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay show you that you need some way to</font>

1089
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:12,009
convert this stuff so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1090
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,310
actually examine it so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

1091
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,310
tools

1092
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:37,069
okay but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that then did what so</font>

1093
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:40,810
then that attorney has to like put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1094
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:40,810
that hard drive into a machine somewhere

1095
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:49,280
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not what you or what I'm</font>

1096
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,319
looking at is i'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font>

1097
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,970
simplified process I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some</font>

1098
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:55,099
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of simplified process well I could</font>

1099
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,480
take any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the thing of it is it</font>

1100
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:59,420
depends on what it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind</font>

1101
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,920
of virtual image it is ok because some

1102
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,990
of them you can do that too and so what

1103
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,839
I'm looking at is ok we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1104
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:08,270
some kind of documented processes on how

1105
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:17,810
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff we need tools to help</font>

1106
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:19,970
us do this right but invite forensic

1107
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,500
investigation wise as far as sending

1108
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,109
this information to an attorney or

1109
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:26,599
somebody to<font color="#E5E5E5"> review I mean it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

1110
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:29,089
whole lot easier because because the

1111
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:31,310
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing too is don't forget that</font>

1112
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:33,078
after you do that then you need to be

1113
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:35,328
searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you need to be searching</font>

1114
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:37,280
for material you need to export material

1115
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:39,470
and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to explain this</font>

1116
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,900
process in a court of law sometimes you

1117
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:44,180
end up with convoluted processes I mean

1118
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:47,450
our art our courts right now have a hard

1119
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:50,359
time even understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cronk computer</font>

1120
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:52,549
crimes that you know takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> both you know</font>

1121
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:55,009
so to explain to them but um you know

1122
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:57,230
but you're right you know there are ways

1123
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:59,359
to do it however there are a little bit

1124
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:02,359
kludgy and convoluted and so the better

1125
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,700
ways to do that would be to have

1126
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">documented processes and tools that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1127
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,299
could you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could actually</font>

1128
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">use to do that also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too there's a number</font>

1129
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the difference of files between</font>

1130
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:15,229
physical and virtual operating system

1131
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,810
installs one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys from NIST did</font>

1132
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:21,020
did hashes on them and there is a huge

1133
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,910
number of differences in between what if

1134

a physical drawer<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is a physical</font>

00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,730
virtual

1137
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:32,840
operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in stock so is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> live or</font>

1138
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:35,960
is it Memorex do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay do you</font>

1139
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,310
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that environment yet okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1140
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,680
I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that many of us</font>

1141
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:41,630
probably heard about the red tail blue

1142
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:46,220
pill you know Joanna<font color="#CCCCCC"> pesky that's a</font>

1143
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:47,930
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of research into that on under</font>

1144
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:50,000
being able to find virtual machines

1145
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,440
based on the relocation of sensitive

1146
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,330
data structures and I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

1147
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,400
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are tool tools out there</font>

1148
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,480
that are scoopy to and Jerry I don't

1149
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,190
know if any of you have seen these

1150
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,770
they're just like so much simple little

1151
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:02,600
blood gosto command line<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools and you</font>

1152
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:04,460
just won the tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it says this is a</font>

1153
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,618
virtual machine this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a real machine</font>

1154
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah that kind of stuff might be</font>

1155
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:10,940
useful and a live investigation but I

1156
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,930
don't know how useful they would be if

1157
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:16,000
you were doing a dead drug investigation

1158
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:18,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so tier some of the challenges</font>

1159
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,420
cincinnati bell is pushing out 800

1160
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:23,660
virtual desktops to users daily use in

1161
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:29,690
12 images<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

1162
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:32,810
where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my stuff who knows virtual</font>

1163
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:35,540
machines are too easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make and too</font>

1164
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:37,250
hard to kill<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's good that vendor</font>

1165
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,630
software lifecycle management for so you

1166
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:42,470
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are making some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> progress are</font>

1167
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:44,960
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VM ware when a machine is</font>

1168
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:48,140
no is no longer in use it gets archived

1169
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so VM ware archives your virtual</font>

1170
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,580
machines if you don't use them anymore

1171
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:55,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so what you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take away</font>

1172
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:59,900
from the talk today virtualization of

1173
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:03,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">environments is growing as examiner's we</font>

1174
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:06,230
need to be more aware of how this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1175
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:08,660
going to affect our investigations will

1176
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,640
we now have virtual crops well where's

1177
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence well I came up a virtual</font>

1178
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,529
operating system and they used a virtual

1179
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:17,300
stream app and I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone runs for</font>

1180
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,359
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual appliance we have a hard</font>

1181
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:22,960
enough time convicting people on the

1182
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:26,110
line machines the way that they are

1183
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,870
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this stuff okay data</font>

1184
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:31,090
retention policies if you are using

1185
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:32,680
virtual machines you probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1186
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:35,110
think about some kind of data retention

1187
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,529
policy what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do with these okay</font>

1188
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:40,240
they hold stuff right federal rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1189
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,740
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> procedure say all your data must be</font>

1190
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,049
turned over and it must be turned over

1191
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,069
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of days so you</font>

1192
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,380
better think about maybe having some

1193
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:49,030
data retention policies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

thing has any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you that are willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1195
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:54,910
write some tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to test</font>

1196
00:54:50,920 --> 00:55:00,880
