this talk somehow we're going to cover

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,110
everything from thinking up the talk to

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,750
actually giving the talk and afterwards

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,360
so planning the talk preparing your talk

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,009
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving your talk and what you</font>

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,020
do after the talk so we're going to

39
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:51,799
cover everything from the start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,869
finish so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with planning</font>

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,670
actually before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start with planning</font>

42
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:59,670
let's do the introduction which I have

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,740
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgotten to do how many of you</font>

44
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,719
have gone to a talk at a security

45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:09,199
convention like Def Con torque on layer

46
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:12,859
1 and been bored out of your skulls

47
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,140
right haven't you gotten to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a talk</font>

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,780
been really interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the topic and</font>

49
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:22,730
gotten lost five minutes in and not

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,920
understood a word afterwards right how

51
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">many of you have gone to a talk that you</font>

52
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,179
really really wanted to see and walked

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,390
away really disappointed because you

54
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:37,730
didn't learn a damn thing so this talk

55
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,250
hopefully will give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the tools to</font>

56
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be that guy and to give the talk</font>

57
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,240
that people want to see and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

58
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,620
like and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they remain interested in</font>

59
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:53,540
and that they'll take something away

60
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:56,180
from so pay attention first you're going

61
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,070
to plan your talk now the first thing

62
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,100
you're going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you do</font>

63
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,100
anything else is know who you're going

64
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:09,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give your talk to know your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> audience</font>

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:12,530
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jerk city one ok so</font>

66
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,270
this is a jerk City strip which is a

67
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,390
perfect example of not knowing your

68
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:20,630
audience here we've got spigot and deuce

69
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,130
are the names of the characters so this

70
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a perfect example of not knowing your</font>

71
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,239
audience specially cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think some of</font>

72
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,190
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect with so</font>

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,340
spigot says let's go to the food court

74
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:36,140
and get girls we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk to them about</font>

75
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,160
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I program doesn't compile perfect</font>

76
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,380
example have not been with your audience

77
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,640
right when does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last time you went</font>

78
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,720
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the food court and picked up girls</font>

79
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,190
and talk to about how your program

80
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,989
doesn't compile and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> got away</font>

81
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:51,560
with it never<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you all need to</font>

82
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">relax I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not you can talk you can talk</font>

83
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,160
oh and one thing I forgot to mention

84
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,540
I've got a prize under the desk here for

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">other like out of lecture and for a</font>

86
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,280
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question so if I hear</font>

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,070
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you will</font>

88
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,890
win something really cool hope so keep

89
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,140
that in mind when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're giving a tech</font>

90
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,500
presentation there are essentially three

91
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,108
kinds of people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to be</font>

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,760
giving presentations ooh the grandmother

93
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,219
who represents the complete nub who

94
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,099
knows nothing the geek

95
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,590
who will lap up every technical detail

96
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,660
you have to offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the business</font>

97
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,549
person who really sort of knows a bit

98
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,720
about technical details but doesn't

99
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">really care so much about the details</font>

100
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,780
they want to know what's the point right

101
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:42,260
so the grandmother is your archetype of

102
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,340
the complete nub she comes in and she

103
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,330
doesn't know a thing about computers

104
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,330
doesn't even know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn a computer</font>

105
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,950
on you know and when you give your talk

106
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though you're giving a technical</font>

107
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,240
talk to a technical audience many of the

108
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,060
people thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much sir many of the</font>

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,590
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your talk will not</font>

110
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,530
know what you're talking about because

111
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you give Tech Talks what happens is</font>

112
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,599
you give<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tech Talks on very specific</font>

113
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,920
very detailed<font color="#E5E5E5"> object topics and most</font>

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,260
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who come in don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

115
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,440
those topics so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give a</font>

116
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,950
tech talk on mobile phone hacking on

117
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,510
evdo for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right a lot of people</font>

118
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,979
everyone your audience probably has a

119
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,810
mobile phone but most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them probably</font>

120
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,720
don't know all the technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> details of</font>

121
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,790
EV do so unless you actually take the

122
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,370
time to teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and introduce</font>

123
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,580
people what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> EV do here's how it works</font>

124
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,010
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics they won't know</font>

125
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,330
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be lost immediately so</font>

126
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,590
if you lose your audience five minutes

127
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,070
in because you delve right into the

128
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,830
technical detail no good there's also

129
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,599
the geek and as it turns out if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

130
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,630
photos for your presentation flickr is a

131
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,270
great great<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to go find them here</font>

132
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,520
is some guy licking his iphone new in

133
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,250
box I don't know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wish I understood</font>

134
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,469
that but this is your archetypal geek

135
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,500
the person who if you came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font>

136
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,810
spent an hour reading out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nortel</font>

137
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">DMS 100 technical configuration manual</font>

138
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:08,570
they would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> you forever and want to</font>

139
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,650
marry<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you know so this the kind of</font>

140
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,380
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> you is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be hungry for</font>

141
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,840
technical detail but and they were going

142
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to love you whatever</font>

143
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">you choose to do but regardless most of</font>

144
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,340
the time you know that person is

145
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,650
actually few and far between if you're

146
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,440
giving a really really interesting in

147
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,120
depth talk on a subject like hacking

148
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,680
smart cards or hacking mobile phones or

149
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,450
whatever they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a few</font>

150
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who come to your talk just for</font>

151
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that talk they've come to this prison</font>

152
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,639
take this come to the convent

153
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,139
because that's the talk they really

154
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,610
really want to see and they really

155
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,230
really want to learn and there's like

156
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,120
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them in the talk can</font>

157
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,650
and the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people are going to</font>

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,360
be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other two types so</font>

159
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,310
consider them as part of your audience

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,560
but don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classic mistake of</font>

161
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,980
believing that this person is the main

162
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,500
member of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience because he's not</font>

163
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:01,070
he's a minority in your audience the

164
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,440
third type person is what makes up the

165
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,599
majority of your talk the business

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,540
person type now I know most of you are

167
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,400
not the you know arrogant executive in

168
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,000
the tie who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 and thinks he owns the</font>

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">world but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business person type does</font>

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
present a useful archetype where here's

171
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:23,060
a person who has a grasp on technical

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,820
things but doesn't know all the details

173
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,710
of what you're going to talk about and

174
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,200
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upshot they don't</font>

175
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">really care whether or not the program</font>

176
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,940
loops with a for loop or a while loop or

177
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,460
branches off or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Forks they want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

178
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,719
what can I do what's the upshot what

179
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,409
does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually mean to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me how does</font>

180
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,130
impact me so consider all these types

181
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,750
when you're preparing your talk once you

182
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,280
know your audience and for tech

183
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,330
audiences for tech conventions it's

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,549
generally going to be the same type of

185
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,260
audience every time so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry too</font>

186
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,910
much about that once you know your

187
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,510
audience you're going to select a

188
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,700
subject now select<font color="#E5E5E5"> a subject you know</font>

189
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,430
reasonably well or that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can research</font>

190
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,719
and no well you don't want to give a

191
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,850
talk on something you don't know

192
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,120
anything about because you'll be laughed

193
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:13,430
off the stage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to narrow your</font>

194
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,389
focus you want to make sure that you can

195
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,850
give a thorough coverage of your subject

196
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,470
in only an hour or 45 minutes or 20

197
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,020
minutes or whatever how much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

198
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,410
have allotted to you you want to make

199
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,789
the subject relevant to your audience

200
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:33,110
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your audience helps you pick</font>

201
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:35,088
that definitely there are audiences to

202
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,950
whom you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can give a talk and they'll</font>

203
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,180
love it you can give the same talk to a

204
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,589
different audience and I'll not have a

205
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,390
clue what you're talking about so

206
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely you know if you're giving a</font>

207
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,680
tech presentation make it somewhat tech

208
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,060
related I can give a presentation on how

209
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,550
to give presentations to a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch</font>

210
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,899
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different audiences</font>

211
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,670
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one how to give tech</font>

212
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,779
presentations because most of you are

213
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,829
technically inclined look how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

214
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:58,600
laptops<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see in this if I were giving a</font>

215
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,560
presentation to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pasadena knitting</font>

216
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,670
club wouldn't make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> about tech don't</font>

217
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,050
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid when you're doing your</font>

218
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,180
research and sucking your subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

219
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,160
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> over yes you may have a subject</font>

220
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,930
which is near and dear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your heart but</font>

221
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you discover halfway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

222
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,979
preparing your talk it's not the subject

223
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:18,300
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you discover that</font>

224
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is nothing that's doable then</font>

225
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,689
don't be afraid to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> over because</font>

226
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,910
better you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time or</font>

227
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,380
spend you better you should throw out

228
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,779
your existing talk and put together<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

229
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,310
talk which works well then spend all

230
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:33,939
your time putting together a talk which

231
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:37,180
doesn't actually work so here's an

232
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:43,360
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bad subject hacking smart</font>

233
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:45,099
cards why is this a bad subject because

234
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,440
I gave that<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk this is not the talk I</font>

235
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:53,880
gave why is this a bad talk too broad to

236
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,079
general smart cards am I talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

237
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,029
transit cards am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about fedex</font>

238
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,209
cards am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about visa cards what</font>

239
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:03,670
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i talking about smart cards is a huge</font>

240
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,649
huge subject and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> takari here</font>

241
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,790
could talk for six hours on hacking

242
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:13,560
smart cards<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not even scratch the</font>

243
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:19,149
surface right yes the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yes a</font>

244
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,829
better subject security vulnerabilities

245
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:24,670
in the fedex kinkos store value<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

246
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:26,260
card this is a focus presentation it's a

247
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,930
single implementation of a smart card

248
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,569
it's a single system<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can analyze it</font>

249
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,949
and this is good<font color="#CCCCCC"> because even though you</font>

250
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,240
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> think oh but this is too focused</font>

251
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:35,680
what do people want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about visa</font>

252
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,920
cards what do people want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

253
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,339
note about Metro cards or oyster cards

254
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,810
or whatever this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good because even</font>

255
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,940
though you're only only analyzing one

256
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,550
system if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> make your presentation</font>

257
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,410
such that the lessons learned and

258
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,180
analyzing the faults of one system can

259
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,740
be applied to any other system the user

260
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,359
may encounter then you've done your job

261
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and given a good presentation join you</font>

262
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
to cover everything just need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover</font>

263
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,200
one example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people can learn from</font>

264
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,550
of course you also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid top</font>

265
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,860
which are completely irrelevant to your

266
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,120
audience because nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> will care no one</font>

267
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,760
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to make smart cards</font>

268
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,470
fashion accessories on myspace or

269
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:17,680
whatever right so once you've picked a

270
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,000
topic you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your research you</font>

271
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,550
want to make sure you research your

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,440
subject thoroughly before you begin

273
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,170
writing your talk because unless you

274
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,250
know all you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can't</font>

275
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,770
start actually putting it together

276
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,680
points which are relevant to your talk

277
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,720
if you only have a moderate grasp at

278
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,729
your subject and you start writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

279
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,800
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you do your research you</font>

280
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,840
may miss something really big which

281
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,790
actually winds up being the key part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

282
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,400
your talk so make sure you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

283
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,589
research first and then start writing do

284
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,530
not do the writing first and then

285
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,390
research to match your writing when

286
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,819
you're researching take copious copious

287
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,550
notes save copies of everything you hem

288
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,980
across you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll probably</font>

289
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,390
throw most of it out but make sure you

290
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,560
document everything thoroughly that way

291
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,810
if you do have something you want to use

292
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're not you won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find yourself two</font>

293
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,180
months later writing your talk and

294
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:14,020
saying crap that that explanation i

295
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,300
found of of how this works where was it

296
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,040
again and then you spend a day searching

297
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,319
on google or yahoo trying to find it and

298
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't find it and then you're lost</font>

299
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,410
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have nothing to back</font>

300
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,420
yourself up so make sure you do all the

301
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:29,560
documentation really thoroughly and make

302
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know your stuff you can</font>

303
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,270
and will throw tons of stuff out but

304
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,949
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> better to have it all and throw it</font>

305
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,930
away then to not have it in the first

306
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,430
place and you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really</font>

307
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,930
throw it all away<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show you why in a</font>

308
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:47,589
bit next you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to select a thesis</font>

309
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:51,339
statement now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to pause</font>

310
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,840
here quickly and note<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for all of</font>

311
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,880
you who came in after the introduction

312
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,800
of the talk I have a prize to give away

313
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,100
if you ask me a really really good

314
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,530
question that challenges me so keep that

315
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,530
in mind you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question</font>

316
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,620
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to get you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys paying</font>

317
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,360
attention I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

318
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,529
thinking I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys an active part</font>

319
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want you guys just</font>

320
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:23,510
sit there and absorb I want you guys to

321
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,160
sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and think and question I want</font>

322
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:36,050
you guys to be active participants not

323
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:37,310
just passive so sorry throw things so

324
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,740
you want to select<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thesis statement</font>

325
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,880
now if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're any of your college papers</font>

326
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,040
or high<font color="#CCCCCC"> school papers this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will seem</font>

327
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,490
very familiar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thesis statement a</font>

328
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,069
single claim to argue during your talk

329
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,150
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue now the reason it's</font>

330
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,810
important to select a thesis statement

331
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:55,010
is because the thesis statement is what

332
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,020
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince your audience</font>

333
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,240
of it's all fine and well to tell the

334
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">audience about something but if you</font>

335
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,800
don't make it relevant interesting the

336
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">audience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has no reason to listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

337
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">audience needs a reason to pay attention</font>

338
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you so the thesis statement is your</font>

339
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,829
argument to them if you tell them you

340
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our kinkos talk example if</font>

341
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,120
you tell them there's a vulnerability in

342
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:20,570
kinkos cards well that's good but why

343
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,339
should I care if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them kinkos</font>

344
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,970
smart cards have a security

345
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:28,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability and you can use this as an</font>

346
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,380
example of how not to set things up if

347
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,819
you're setting up your own system or how

348
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,970
to look for vulnerabilities in your own

349
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,010
system then they'll pay attention

350
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,350
because they'll realize oh wait a second

351
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,120
I can use this information somehow even

352
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,310
though I never you kind of go to kinkos

353
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can use this talk this is relevant to</font>

354
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,699
me this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bit scary so argue during</font>

355
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,339
your talk make your talk relevant and

356
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,110
focus to your chosen subject and you

357
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,520
need to tell your audience again why

358
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:01,400
they should care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you have to</font>

359
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:02,720
say so a bad thesis statement fedex

360
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,060
kinko's<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored-value smart cards have a</font>

361
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,540
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability why is this a bad</font>

362
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,189
why is this a bad thesis statement not

363
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,680
so much too long because the good ones

364
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,680
actually longer yeah

365
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:26,500
right what about it why should you care

366
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:29,500
this is the topic reworded this is not a

367
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,920
piece of statement the topic is security

368
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,680
vulnerabilities in fedex yo smart cards

369
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,410
there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument here during this is</font>

370
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,270
a truism a good thesis statement would

371
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,219
be something along the lines of poor

372
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,780
choices in the design phase of the fedex

373
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,820
kinko's stored value smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> card system</font>

374
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:49,540
have led to pervasive embarrassing

375
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,160
insecurities so now this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

376
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,370
relevant this is more hard-hitting this

377
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,260
is something you care about oh look not

378
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,850
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I make port or if I make poor</font>

379
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,000
choices in setting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> my security system</font>

380
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,670
not only will I have a lot to deal with

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,990
I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be up the shitter because I'm</font>

382
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be embarrassed I may lose my</font>

383
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:14,380
job I may lose my reputation maybe I

384
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">should pay attention to this talk so yes</font>

385
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:29,290
I don't know I wish I<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew it's been</font>

386
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,370
modified I don't know if it's fixed per

387
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,240
se I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at it since</font>

388
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,590
but ok now that you have your topic and

389
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">your thesis statement now you can start</font>

390
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,940
to structure your talk if you have ever

391
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,030
written a paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kai's high school or</font>

392
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,010
college this will seem eerily familiar

393
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:48,880
introduction three supporting arguments

394
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:53,230
and a conclusion how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have</font>

395
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:56,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this before see this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rocket</font>

science your introduction first<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make friends with your audience you</font>

want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected with your audience</font>

399
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,160
throughout the entire talk how many of

400
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,709
you have been to talks where the guy

401
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,379
stands here at the lecture in the entire

402
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and talks and looks at the laptop</font>

403
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">and talks looks with laptop get signal</font>

404
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:16,270
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left doesn't acknowledge</font>

405
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,400
the guy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two minutes you've been to</font>

406
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,540
that talk right that guy has not made

407
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,319
friends with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience the guy is</font>

408
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,109
talking at an invisible brick wall

409
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,240
right here and there isn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of</font>

410
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,279
the audience beyond it but the guy has

411
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">not made friends with the audience he's</font>

412
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">not connected with you you guys are not</font>

413
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:34,350
active participants and he's not

414
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:38,250
actively talking to you he's giving his

415
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,418
talk to the wall again make sure you

416
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,429
introduce the subject to your audience

417
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,789
make sure you want to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them why they</font>

418
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:47,070
should care you want to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a good</font>

419
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:49,620
reason to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to you again if</font>

420
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">you lose your audience you can't get</font>

421
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,268
them back you might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as a</font>

422
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:56,219
general rule expect that you can't so

423
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:57,929
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your audience gets</font>

424
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,039
interested and stays interested the

425
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:03,259
entire time you're giving your talk

426
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,940
you're supporting arguments are

427
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:07,710
basically smaller more focused versions

428
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,240
of your primary argument the best

429
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,330
analogy for this I ever heard was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

430
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,450
debate class I took in high school we're

431
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:17,549
basically your thesis and your overall

432
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,009
point think of it like a three-legged

433
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:22,110
stool thesis in the overall point are

434
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:23,899
the top part of the stool each of the

435
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,580
supporting arguments is one of the legs

436
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:27,959
if one of those legs is weak the whole

437
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,918
thing collapses when you try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit on</font>

438
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,720
it so likewise your talk needs three

439
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,559
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong supporting arguments each</font>

440
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:41,820
hitting it from a different angle which

441
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,710
reinforce your primary point you should

442
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,509
have at least three but no<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

443
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:53,269
five supporting arguments why do you

444
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:58,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is people forget things right</font>

445
00:18:53,269 --> 00:19:01,019
I'm sorry exactly if you have no

446
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,659
difficulty getting it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 20</font>

447
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:07,080
supporting arguments your topic is too

448
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:08,850
broad and need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow it down if you</font>

449
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a tough time coming up with even</font>

450
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">three you've narrowed your topic too</font>

451
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,658
much need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand it a little bit so</font>

452
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,168
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and five supporting</font>

453
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:21,120
arguments is a good number<font color="#E5E5E5"> to aim for</font>

454
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:22,559
preferably three possibly four maybe

455
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,500
five depending on the length of your

456
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk generally 1843 that you can talk</font>

457
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,070
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in depth rather than five you</font>

458
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:34,080
cover only<font color="#E5E5E5"> so-so but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again make sure</font>

459
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,370
just think about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk think about</font>

460
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,809
your topic

461
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:41,580
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this makes sense for your</font>

462
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:44,190
talk finally your conclusion you wrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

463
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,189
the talk you review your primary

464
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,380
arguments and you make a connection back

465
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,090
to your introduction the conclusion is

466
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,400
where you tell your audience what

467
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,809
they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the audience</font>

468
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to be entertained but let's</font>

469
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,379
face it you certain this talk for an

470
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,930
hour I talked for an hour you're not

471
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,520
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember everything I say</font>

472
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:05,010
that's what the video is for so you can

473
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,450
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and review</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it later right the</font>

474
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,360
conclusion is well you where you tell

475
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,670
people this is what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

476
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,809
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> these the five things I want</font>

477
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,420
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember as you walk out that</font>

478
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:17,428
door and if you can get your audience to

479
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,590
remember those five things and remember

480
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:26,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you expand it on them in your talk</font>

481
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:30,570
you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job so now preparing</font>

482
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:32,040
the talk the one big overall overarching

483
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,280
thing to remember when preparing the

484
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,690
talk is the KISS principle which some of

485
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,059
you may be familiar with some of you may

486
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,920
not be familiar with it's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

487
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">with kissing as I deal with lips it has</font>

488
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:51,179
nothing to do with makeup it is keep it

489
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple stupid because when you have done</font>

490
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,050
all your research and you found

491
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:56,879
everything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to find when you're</font>

492
00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:00,080
ready to write<font color="#E5E5E5"> your talk you're going to</font>

493
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,240
have a massive pile of information and

494
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,949
many people based on talks I've gone to

495
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,510
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to new mex is you</font>

496
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,640
take this massive pile of information

497
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you put into PowerPoint and then you</font>

498
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,650
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it or you go up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you read</font>

499
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,330
the PowerPoint and get all the stuff

500
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:19,970
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience verbally as quickly as</font>

501
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:25,590
you can in the hour you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> right no</font>

502
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:27,780
it's a question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time 30 50 minutes is</font>

503
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,129
not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to give a talk if</font>

504
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,860
you've never given a talk before you're

505
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,929
going to think an hour how am I ever

506
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,000
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk for an hour about the</font>

507
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:38,130
subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my god I better find as much</font>

508
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,660
information as I can so that I can just

509
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:44,850
talk and talk and talk not have to pause

510
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,040
but that's not it an hour is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a lot</font>

511
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,199
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I mean it's already been 20</font>

512
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,059
minutes that I've been giving this talk

513
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,570
and we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> covered a whole lot of</font>

514
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:57,570
information yet so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

515
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">time you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discard as much</font>

516
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:03,779
information as you can how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

517
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,100
seen la story<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that scene</font>

518
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:07,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the beginning where Steve Martin's</font>

519
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:11,779
girlfriend does this and then pulls off

520
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,820
the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that catches her eye no</font>

521
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:17,120
okay clearly all of you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch</font>

522
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,470
that movie it's a great stupid movie

523
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,820
you're going to discard as much

524
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:24,360
information as possible I forget who

525
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,860
said this but perfection is achieved not

526
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,799
when there is nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add when there</font>

527
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,570
is nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away you're going to</font>

528
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,450
prune as much and make this as simple

529
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,970
and easy to understand as possible of

530
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">course make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure when you're putting</font>

531
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,549
putting your talk to give you save at

532
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,529
least five minutes at the end for Q&A

533
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:42,059
session because your audience is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

534
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have questions we're going to cover</font>

535
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,990
if this in a bit so keep that in mind

536
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">but remember save some time at the end</font>

537
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,049
for the audience to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you questions</font>

538
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:56,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now my biggest pet peeve with so</font>

539
00:22:52,049 --> 00:23:00,899
many Tech Talks the PowerPoint problem

540
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:04,049
powerpoint is not your talk powerpoint

541
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:07,500
is merely there to assist you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

542

talk you are the speaker if all you're

543
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,529
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is taking all your research</font>

544
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,750
putting it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerPoint and reading it</font>

545
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:16,620
to the audience your function is

546
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:18,029
completely irrelevant as a speaker the

547
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,939
audience could literally take your

548
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,169
documents and just read them<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home why</font>

549
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,990
should they come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your talk of all</font>

550
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:26,370
you're going to do is read to them you

00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:28,529
website and read the information on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

577
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:30,000
own time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but don't waste most of your</font>

578
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:31,740
audience's time telling the technical

579
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,570
details of every little thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talk</font>

580
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:38,340
about now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to keep</font>

581
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,399
your slides as simple as possible why do

582
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:45,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what do you think the reason</font>

583
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:46,469
for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's distracting when it</font>

584
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,239
when the slide shows up with a ton of

585
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,830
texts what happens everyone looks at the

586
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,649
slide and stops listening to you until

587
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,970
they finish reading the slide so when

588
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:56,100
you pull up your slide with the wall of

589
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,110
text whatever you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the next 30</font>

590
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:03,330
seconds has gone on deaf ears no one

591
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:07,379
listens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some bad</font>

592
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:09,629

631
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:57,430
the other pit fall apart from the wall

632
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:04,480
of text terrible slide who can guess

633
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:06,150
what the next pitfall is sorry the lie

634
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,260
of demo

635
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:12,090
oh boy the live demo how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

636
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,270
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAT through five minutes of oh let</font>

637
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:17,040
me just get my<font color="#E5E5E5"> love dimmer working I</font>

638
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:23,280
should see more hands come on you've

639
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:25,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">been there there we go live demos as a</font>

640
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,810
rule can and will go horribly painfully

641
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,150
terribly wrong they won't work when you

642
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:32,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">want them to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do a live demo it</font>

643
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,740
must be short<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have seen so many live</font>

644
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,720
demo was worth 20 minutes of someone

645
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,430
typing text into a terminal and I get

646
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,460
bored and I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore at the</font>

647
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:44,310
end Asuma must be short must be to the

648
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,890
point must progress quickly and only

649
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,970
effective if done extremely well

650
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,130
otherwise you're better off doing like a

651
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">slideshow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what you intend that way</font>

652
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,940
you can skip over all the boring parts

653
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,110
skip over all the let's wait here for

654
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,620
five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> while figures out the</font>

655
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">security key parts and get to the point</font>

656
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,590
and get on with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your talk because again</font>

657
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:06,330
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time a recorded</font>

658
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,340
demo perhaps if you can tighten<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up if</font>

659
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it down or just do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

660
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">show sorry have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known don't even do</font>

661
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,379
a live demo unless you can do it right

662
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the spot have it be a couple minutes</font>

663
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">long and that's it the best live demo I</font>

664
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:26,490
saw was the live demo last year that

665
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zach gave for his for his proximity</font>

666
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,120
card demonstration if you look the video

667
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,159
that one he's got it all set up and he

668
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,350
just does his thing and it beeps and

669
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,730
he's on to the next point he does his

670
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:39,919
card and it beeps he's on to the next

671
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:45,440
point there is no nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that breaks</font>

672
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,440
nothing that fails not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> datagram talk</font>

673
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:58,620
I love you Datagram this is a fun moment

674
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,570
I remember this one so do a slideshow

675
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,510
for example if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce</font>

676
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,899
a new protocol let's have our characters

677
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:11,040
from jerk<font color="#CCCCCC"> City introduced the protocol</font>

678
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:14,580
hi cocks the high cock protocol RFC 43

679
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:19,178
73 do any of you know what RFC 4370 is

680
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:23,029
40 50 73 is ldap

681
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:26,960
so yeah and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to make sure</font>

682
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:28,909
you proofread your slides right how do

683
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,070
you have been to presentations and seen

684
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:33,950
horrendously bad spelling errors typos

685
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,950
grammar problems on the slides does that

686
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:41,200
not make the presenter look of it stupid

687
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,200
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes reduces their credibility</font>

688
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:47,480
perhaps but still there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things</font>

689
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,200
called spell checkers there are friends

690
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,460
who speak the language<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure your</font>

691
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,379
proofread your slides to avoid making

692
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,909
yourself look dumb if you English is

693
00:30:54,379 --> 00:30:58,580
your second language you have somewhat

694
00:30:55,909 --> 00:31:00,169
of an excuse I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have</font>

695
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">inglot I've friends who speak english</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

696
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:03,409
a second language who's being<font color="#E5E5E5"> English</font>

697
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,970
far better than many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people I know who</font>

698
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:08,450
for whom English is their primary

699
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:11,330
language so that's not maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not</font>

700
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,740
the best excuse check your spelling and

701
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,330
grammar check your spelling and grammar

702
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,919
check your spelling and grammar there

703
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,500
are spell checks in my instant messaging

704
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,470

spelling and grammar check for

706
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,809
consistency note how almost slides are

707
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:28,250
the same they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all consistent makes it</font>

708
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:29,750
look polished makes it looks good makes

709
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,250
it look good makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like you put</font>

710
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,419
time and effort into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

711
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:42,529
and didn't just put it together the

712
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:44,720
morning before have someone else read

713
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:47,750
through your slides and give you

714
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,940
feedback this is important<font color="#CCCCCC"> have someone</font>

715
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,440
you trust give you feedback and tell

them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ruthless if they tell you</font>

717
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,090
this makes no sense I don't understand

718
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,340
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is boring listen to them</font>

719
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,439
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're telling you these</font>

720
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:04,029
things most people who come to your talk

721
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,830
are going to tell you the same thing and

722
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:08,929
then really important ignore your slides

723
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:12,379
for a few days then come back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> proof</font>

724
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">read them again this is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

725
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:15,949
wonders for your talk because you're

726
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to come back after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a weekend or</font>

727
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,850
after a couple days surfing or skiing or

728
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:22,149
whatever you choose to do and you're

729
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hell was I thinking</font>

730
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:28,129
if all you do is live in your slides

731
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,169
from the moment you start into the

732
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:31,760
moment you talk you're going to lose

733
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:33,080
track<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reality you're going to lose</font>

734
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,150
track of how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks as someone who is</font>

735
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,040
not intimately familiar with what you're

736
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,480
going through to prepare your talk so

737
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,159
make sure you give yourself some time

738
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,780
between putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> your talk together and</font>

739
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,730
looking at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself a</font>

740
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,700
fresh dose perspective and be ruthless

741
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,740
take things out change things don't be

742
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,510
afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this the better you can</font>

743
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,490
make it the more people you can show it

744
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,860
to you beforehand and have them say yeah

745
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:56,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great talk or this makes no</font>

746
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,219
sense the better you're going to do when

747
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:04,720
you give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a real audience of people</font>

748
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:08,690
you don't know so now giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk</font>

749
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:12,350
our third point you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider</font>

750
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:14,480
your audience the audience is very eager

751
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hear what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to say if they</font>

752
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,720
didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to say</font>

753
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,670
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be spending hours of their</font>

754
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,950
time sitting in a room listening to your

755
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:25,250
talk there'd be off at home reading

756
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:28,610
things on the web playing games doing

757
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,960
whatever they do at home make the

758
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:34,040
audience work for you by giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

759
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:41,840
what they want so what does the audience

760
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:44,030

762
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,950
have a good time learning them that's

763
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:52,160
all they want they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to know</font>

764
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:54,110
everything in the tech manual they're

765
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,430
doing to know all the trials and

766
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,740
tribulations of how you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> from point</font>

767
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:59,500
to point B they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what is</font>

768
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,570
this and how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it affect me and</font>

that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time learning</font>

770
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:13,668
it so when you speak make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> first off</font>

people in the audience aren't going to

care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you miss a point if you stumble</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">get away from the lectern it forces you</font>

824
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:47,420
to not rely on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your PowerPoint slides as</font>

825
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:50,690
a crutch your PowerPoint slides are not

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,430
your show notes there is a thing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

827
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,109
bottom on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen I've got the slide</font>

828
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,328
I've got a window below that says click

829
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:59,150
to add notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can type notes to myself</font>

830
00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:01,970
I've got no notes all I need to know is

831
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,069
in the summary on the slides so make

832
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,450
sure that you get away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that connect</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with your audience the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing here there is more of me</font>

835
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,970
for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at if I'm standing here</font>

836
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,890
I'm hiding behind the lectern and

837
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,810
there's a barrier between you and me and

838
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,359
I'm not connecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you guys if I'm</font>

839
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:22,759
over here I'm more connected with you

840
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,200
guys it's friendlier it's more casual

841
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,530
you guys are more interested you're

842
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,450
paying more attention so get yourself

843
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:33,109
one of these little remotes get away

844
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:40,250
from the lectern now on the subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

845
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:42,410
humor humor is necessary you're giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

846
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,880
technical talk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to bore</font>

847
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:47,328
your audience you want to make them have

a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time be funny be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relaxed if you</font>

get your<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience laughing that relaxes</font>

850
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,780
them and that makes them more apt to pay

851
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,810
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey we're two</font>

audience decisions and everything you

858
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,120
longer interest in what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

859
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,500
they're thinking oh god this guy is

860
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:19,640
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be funny and failing miserably</font>

861
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,640
I don't want to listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him anymore so</font>

862
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:24,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">balance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your jokes off people also don't</font>

863
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,230
do the humor too much you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving a</font>

864
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">tech presentation you're not a stand-up</font>

865
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:33,090
comedian too much humor is a bad bad

866
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:35,220
thing so try not to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a last</font>

867
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:38,850
resort ask your friends does this joke

868
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,169
sound funny to you but I use this but

869
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,360
when you're peering out all the excess

870
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,370
humor you've put into your talk use the

871
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,080
same rule as when you're burying<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

872
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,080
technical information keep it simple

873
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,720
keep it basic just<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw in a joke every</font>

874
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:55,529
now and again where it makes sense and

875
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:58,439
where it's relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your audience pay</font>

876
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:01,080
attention also you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want your audience to</font>

877
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,090
pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you so you should pay</font>

878
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,520
attention to your audience going back to

879
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,680
our example of the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> who stand behind</font>

880
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,030
a lectern and reach the PowerPoint

881
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,319
slides and tells you everything on this

882
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,430
live and doesn't pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

883
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,680
guys standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for five minutes</font>

884
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:18,180
saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ten minutes left hello</font>

885
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:20,370
sir sir hello hello the guys in his own

886
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,529
little bubble not paying attention to

887
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:24,450
you is the audience so if the presenter

888
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:27,590
doesn't care about you why should use

889
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,589
the audience care about the presenter

890
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,820
your audience will tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they're</font>

891
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,560
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good time or a bad time if</font>

892
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,660
they're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you they'll be</font>

893
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at you they'll be interested</font>

894
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,170
they'll be studying your slides don't

895
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">look back and forth you'll see that look</font>

896
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,390
of I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking this makes sense this is</font>

897
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:49,440
cruel i'm interested if you've lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

898
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:52,140
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see or you're going to</font>

899
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,490
see faces buried in laptops we're

900
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,990
against people chatting back and forth

901
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,220
you're going to see doodling they're not

902
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,750
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking at you or the slide</font>

903
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,859
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be bored and you're</font>

904
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:03,150
gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to tell by looking</font>

905
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:04,860
directly at them so you must respond to

906
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,510
your audience if you're losing your

907
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,360
audience do something to get them back

908
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:12,090
get their attention have fun tell them

909
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,000
what do you ask them what do you want to

910
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,840
know what can I do for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to make you</font>

911
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,160
have a good time

912
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,750
ask them to tell you something ask them

913
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,399
to participate ask them to be part of

914
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,740
the part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the presentation and not</font>

915
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,300
just listeners to a TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> set which happens</font>

916
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:32,310
to be live in front of them so now after

917
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,720
you give the talk the Q&A session is

918
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:38,200
where you go from being<font color="#CCCCCC"> the speaker to</font>

919
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,580
being the expert any idiot can give up

920
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,029
and can come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and give a talk</font>

921
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">about anything however the Q&A is where</font>

922
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,780
you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> shine because if you've done</font>

923
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">all your research properly all that</font>

924
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,110
research will be buried<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back of</font>

925
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,540
your head somewhere even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though you've</font>

926
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,710
torn most of it out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your presentation</font>

927
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,900
so all the research be in the back of

928
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">your head and they'll be on that CD you</font>

929
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,760
gave to everybody and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people ask</font>

930
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,870
you questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go oh yeah that</font>

931
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">weird thing you're asking about well</font>

932
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,470
really what happens is this this this

933
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,240
this this that's your chance to sign

934
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">chime that's where the audience believes</font>

935
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,000
you that's where they go from here

936
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:13,900
someone who says something interesting

937
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,430
to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone I want to talk to here's</font>

938
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,990
someone I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to know here's</font>

939
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,790
someone I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

940
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:22,509
respect their knowledge about the

941
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:26,860
subject always give your audience time

942
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:30,160
to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and one of my</font>

943
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:33,100
biggest biggest pet peeves in tech talks

944
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,109
when someone asks you a question repeat

945
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,540
the question before you answer it

946
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:39,670
because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy up here asks a</font>

947
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,440
question and I can hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> him fine and I</font>

948
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,820
start answering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question you in the</font>

949
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,890
back haven't heard the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

950
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,090
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> my answer makes no sense and</font>

951
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,750
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not going to pay</font>

952
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:51,790
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it so when someone asks you</font>

953
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,200
a question repeat the question because

954
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,820
not only will it<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you</font>

955
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,680
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> properly before</font>

956
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,390
you answer it it'll make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

957
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,649
everyone else knows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is and</font>

958
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:02,950
therefore what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer actually</font>

959
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:04,330
relates to otherwise you're giving them

960
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">information they're going to throw away</font>

961
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,799
and never use and you're wasting your

962
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,510
time and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

963
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,100
whose time you're giving is the person

964
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,930
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked the question and maybe whoever</font>

965
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,790
was in earshot that's a bad bad thing

966
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:20,819
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste anyone's time not yours</font>

967
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:22,750
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience's when your time is up</font>

968
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,820
invite people to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one-on-one</font>

969
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside the presentation there's only so</font>

970
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:29,290
much time for Q&A anyway so really let

971
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:33,580
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

972

you afterwards it's only a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

973
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:40,000
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to summarize and again what do we</font>

00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:43,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">do in the summary in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the conclusion go</font>

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,530
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> face us and</font>

976
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:48,970
what am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">door right so know your audience and</font>

979
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,770
prepare the talk which they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

980
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:59,320
useful and interesting two key things

981
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:02,890
useful and interesting knowledge and

982
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,930
entertainment teach both<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tech savvy</font>

983
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,120
and those who are unfamiliar with it set

984
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,649
with your subject matter again if you do

985
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,970
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly introduce your subject</font>

986
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,190
matter if you don't teach your audience

987
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,480
this is the first thing I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

988
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,940
talk about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is why it's</font>

989
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,020
important this is the second thing what

990
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,330
you're going to talk about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why</font>

991
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,520
it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> and finally this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

992
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,380
it all relates if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dive straight</font>

993
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,670
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical detail you've lost</font>

994
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,370
eighty percent of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience and</font>

995
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,230
you're never going to get them back so

996
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:31,990

00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've given this talk before several</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">simple your slideshow is not your talk</font>

1009
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:06,310
your slideshow is not your show notes

1010
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:07,510
your slideshow is a summary of what

1011
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,940
you're talking about your slideshow<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:11,320
guide<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if your audience does happen to</font>

00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,060
audience do not use<font color="#CCCCCC"> your PowerPoint</font>

1018

slideshow as a crutch do not use

1019
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,980
electron as a crutch because again if

1020
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:28,210
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasting</font>

1021
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,500
everyone's time and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience would</font>

1022
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,540
be better served by just reading what

1023
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:35,470
you have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> online at home in their</font>

1024
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:38,259
underwear avoid the live demo if you

1025
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:40,029
possibly can make it a slideshow or make

1026
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,440
it a video or something cut it down and

1027
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,900
make it not a major part of your

1028
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,640
presentation

1029
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:49,360
slow down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and relax so people can</font>

1030
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:53,680
understand you and finally give the

1031
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:55,420
audience time to ask you questions with

1032
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:13,480
that in mind do you all have any

1033
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:14,980
questions yes yes make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power one</font>

problems make the typeface big make it

1038
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:28,290
simple make it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know easy to read</font>

1039
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:45,700
maybe they came in late yes hostile

1040
00:45:42,370 --> 00:46:00,850
audience yes what was the more you want

1041

<font color="#E5E5E5">noise in the microphone yes avoid filler</font>

1045
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:20,530
words do not say like um yeah you know

1046
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:22,540
right also and all yeah avoid that stuff

1047
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,730
if you need to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second to think</font>

1048
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:28,450
don't say anything just take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that second</font>

1049
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:30,750
to think now you had a question in the

1050
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,750
back sir

1051

the question was I didn't hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> him so</font>

1052
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:45,910
I'm sorry see I didn't quite follow my

1053
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:47,440
own advice what he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> was why would</font>

1054
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:49,290
they be sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back if they're</font>

1055
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,270
wearing eyeglasses and I'm I problems

1056
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:54,270
but like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said perhaps talk was full</font>

1057
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:02,080
how forgiving<font color="#E5E5E5"> his eloquence cetera on</font>

1061
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,910
well I've given talks which violate all

1062
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:20,380
these rules but that's before I really

1063
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,529
figure things out you had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for</font>

1064
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font>

can you relax well first off be

1068
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:43,220

1069
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,599
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people hang out with people</font>

1072
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:54,589
helpfully pointing out beer beer is a

1073
00:47:52,200 --> 00:48:01,078
very useful thing beer or alcohol or

1074
00:47:54,589 --> 00:48:03,619

1075
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,619

1078
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:32,970
material well this is why I advise you

1079
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:35,129
to pick a subject you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> well already</font>

1080
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,450
that way when you give the subject when

1081
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you give the talk you know what you're</font>

1082
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:40,350

1085
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,330
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to rely on PowerPoint as</font>

1086
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,950
a crutch you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> way through the</font>

1087
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,950

1095
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,950
question is there a barometer for do you

1096
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:54,780
know a subject well enough to talk about

1097

<font color="#E5E5E5">it sometimes know but sometimes yes can</font>

00:49:54,780 --> 00:50:00,780
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find your find someone who you know</font>

1101
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:09,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell me everything I need to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1102
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,600
can sit there for 30 minutes 45 minutes

1103
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:14,130
and teach them the basics and teach them

1104
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,779
everything they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand maybe</font>

1105
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,130
they won't understand it but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1106
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,380
can't it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and teach it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them for</font>

1107
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:21,240
an hour or so you've probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a good</font>

1108
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough grasp on it if you're struggling</font>

1109
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:27,149
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with material after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

1110
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:28,859
minutes probably not but again the thing

1111
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">about knowing the subject well is see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1112
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:33,509
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a basic</font>

1113
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,339
outline without having any research done

1114
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,720
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of a good thesis statement</font>

1115
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,460
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of three strong points</font>

1116
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,470
because again if you think about an hour

1117
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">write your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction is maybe five</font>

1118
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:47,310
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your conclusion is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

1119
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:50,759
your QA is another 10-15 minutes so

1120
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:53,240
that's already what 30 minutes so each

1121
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,320
of your three points is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes long</font>

1122
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,000
can you talk for ten minutes about each

1123
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:04,260
of you three points then you're probably

1124
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:11,110
good to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1125
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:20,670
as far as the really good question who

00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:55,779
advice topic than anything else that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1130
00:51:54,550 --> 00:52:00,700
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question because I didn't cover it</font>
