00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:09,719
howdy howdy folks hopefully everybody

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,250
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good lunch you guys get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chance</font>

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,799
to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to the registration</font>

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">area we have the lock-picking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> booth set</font>

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,490
up if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys had a chance to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> play with</font>

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the gringo warrior</font>

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,839
challenge where you actually have to

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,779
break your way out of a jail cell pretty

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,820
cool stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and right now I'd like to</font>

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,160
introduce a Adam Shostak who somebody I

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,570
actually work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with he's going to be</font>

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,360
talking about the security development

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">lifecycle it's something we use heavily</font>

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,480
at work and it's exportable to other

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,180
companies as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it basically</font>

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,529
covers how products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and services get</font>

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,920
developed with security in mind from

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,480
beginning to end in Adams case he

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,860
actually was the new version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the book</font>

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,309
because it's a you wrote the book<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it</font>

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,140
not the original one but oh you haven't

22
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">written it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so he hasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written the</font>

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,949
book on him but he's damn smart so so

24
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,209
what go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let Adam go ahead and</font>

25
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,289
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:15,600
get a kick out of this one it's pretty

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:17,280
pretty well researched so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,890
now we have microphone there's nothing

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than coming after someone who's</font>

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,650
given an hour-long talk on how to

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,589
present so if you get bored just<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus</font>

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,329
on all of my flaws and you can pay

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,890
attention that way but what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,408
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about today is I'd like to talk</font>

35
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,630
about threat modeling as we do it at

36
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,820
Microsoft and some of the lessons that

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,530
we've learned I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Microsoft for</font>

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,020
only two years but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been throughout</font>

39
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,220
modeling and i'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the history</font>

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,720
but there's a tremendous amount that

41
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,850
we've learned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what makes the</font>

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,408
process work and what doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and</font>

43
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,460
so the way I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to structure this</font>

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,970
talk is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a little</font>

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit of context what's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sdl what do I</font>

46
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,630
mean when I say threat modeling talk

47
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,339
about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pain that we've</font>

48
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,229
experienced talk about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,700
issues that we've seen as we've done

50
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,509
throughout modeling as we've taken it

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,060
out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers chalk up to you</font>

52
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:13,500
about how we do it today and a little

53
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,300
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about how we decide</font>

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,640
what it was we were going to do today so

55
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,340
that you can learn and you can adapt it

56
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,769
to your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations if your work</font>

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,200
for a company that develops software in

58
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,630
some way then you can use this if you're

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,429
a consultant you can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at your</font>

60
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,880
consulting customers and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">you the intellectual toolbox that I used</font>

62
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,370
as I redeveloped the process so that

63
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,809
we're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more success as we</font>

64
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,820
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> deploy it so some context as</font>

65
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,790
annoyed said the security development

66
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifecycle is a mandatory process at</font>

67
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft all teams have to do it</font>

68
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,459
whether they're shipping box<font color="#CCCCCC"> software</font>

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,020
whether they're deploying web services

70
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:03,530
and it's a comprehensive process it goes

71
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,620
from the conception of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software</font>

72
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,070
where you're doing requirements analysis

73
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:16,140
through develop design development

74
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:17,700
testing deployment and update the MSR

75
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,208
see the Microsoft Security Response

76
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,459
Center the processes they engage in are

77
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,280
seen as part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdl and they also</font>

78
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,750
they include this learning cycle we look

79
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,790
at the patches that we issue in the

80
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,040
updates<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we issue and say what can</font>

81
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">we learn how can we drive that back in</font>

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,609
so we are less and less likely to make

83
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,900
similar mistakes in the future and

84
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,430
threat modeling which is what I'm going

85
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,700
to talk about is one of the primary

86
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,190
activities we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the design phase</font>

87
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,548
now threat modeling as a term means a

88
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,810
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things to different people and it</font>

89
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,970
means a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things at different</font>

90
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,209
organizations it's perfectly legitimate

91
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,549
for someone to ask what's your threat

92
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,160
model and I think of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as very IETF</font>

93
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,769
centric threat modeling down in the

94
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,500
bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand corner excuse me your</font>

95
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,780
bottom left hand corner of the diagram

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,940
where you've got experts thinking about

97
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,010
the requirements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

98
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,918
build two and a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to what's</font>

99
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,450
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat model might be a heckler in</font>

100
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,370
the audience or someone who takes

101
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,270
possession of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a laptop that was left</font>

102
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:27,330
unlocked over there during the break

103
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,340
or it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you're</font>

104
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,960
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say the Torah project it</font>

105
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,818
might be the global passive adversary

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,049
listening to all packets transmitted

107
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:40,830
anywhere and this is a very expert

108
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:43,830
centric process at Microsoft we go from

109
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,810
experts to all engineers we ask everyone

110
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,109
to get involved in the threat models and

111
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,259
I'll talk later about why and a threat

112
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">model analysis document is a longer more</font>

113
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,830
complex<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on some of these run to</font>

114
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,979
dozens and hundreds of pages talking

115
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,889
about here are the things that might go

116
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,690
wrong in deployment and so when I'm

117
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">going most of what I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

118
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,370
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is over on your right hand</font>

119
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">side it's the security development life</font>

120
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,060
cycle throughout modeling process which

121
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,770
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed to work for all engineers</font>

122
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,669
and has gone through a lot of refinement

123
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:27,870
to make it work in that environment so

124
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:30,180
to allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand where it is</font>

125
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,990
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are today and where we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

126
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,909
I want to talk a fair in some in a fair

127
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,310
amount of detail about the past about

128
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:40,590
what's happened and about what's gone

129
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,960
wrong because without knowing that

130
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,758
context of what's gone wrong it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

131
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,219
hard to understand why we've made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

132
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,039
choices that we've made and it's very

133
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,990
hard if you go out and start to deploy a

134
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">threat modeling process and you watch it</font>

135
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,300
break maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have talked about one</font>

136
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the ways in which it might break and</font>

137
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,370
you can use that to understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

138
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:05,460
can fix it and that's why I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

139
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,650
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past in some detail so</font>

140
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,568
the Dilbert cartoon involving Mourdock

141
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,779
preventer of information secure of

142
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,610
information services and more tax starts

143
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,979
out by saying security is more important

144
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,289
than usability in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world no one</font>

145
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,900
would be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use anything and then</font>

146
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:24,529
we've edited it slightly<font color="#CCCCCC"> to complete the</font>

147
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,929
threat model stare directly at the Sun

148
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:30,599
and this is this is the way some

149
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,020
versions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the process have felt to the</font>

150
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,449
people being asked to engage in them so

151
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,440
we've been doing this for almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

152
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,440
years

153
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,620
as a formalized documented process we've

154
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,660
been doing it for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer and when</font>

155
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,030
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we i really mean the company</font>

156
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,680
before i joined there are people who

157
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,219
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing threat modeling in</font>

158
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,180
various forms for upwards of 20 years

159
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">but finding formal formal documentation</font>

160
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,540
dedicated to what the threats are and

161
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,140
how we're going to mitigate or address

162
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,750
them goes back about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years and in</font>

163
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that 10 years we we've had just this</font>

164
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,180
explosion of interesting ideas which

165
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,460
we've put to the test with a variety of

166
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,460
real product team shipping real software

167
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I mention that because when I've</font>

168
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,900
been a consultant I've gone out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've</font>

169
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,020
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to do some crap</font>

170
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,030
modeling and one of the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

171
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,900
I run into very early<font color="#CCCCCC"> and selling that</font>

172
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:33,719
activity is this is just security

173
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,870
geeking no one real ever does this stuff

174
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,790
right and so my answer to you and the

175
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,830
answer that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take out and use is</font>

176
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no people really do do this stuff</font>

177
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a commercial</font>

178
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:52,109
development process I'm cleverly taking

179
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:59,310
a drink<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> water well you all read this</font>

180
00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:01,620
slide and my point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide is that</font>

181
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,980
we've been through<font color="#E5E5E5"> an awful lot of</font>

182
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,530
versions of the process and we've

183
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,230
published an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those Mike</font>

184
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,909
Howard and Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> LeBlanc's books on the</font>

185
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,890
Fiat<font color="#CCCCCC"> modeling book which annoyed thought</font>

186
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,919
that I wrote was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frank swiderski and</font>

187
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> schneider and each of these</font>

188
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,200
versions of the process is different and

189
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,030
none of them match what I'm going to

190
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:29,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you today and i'll tell you why</font>

191
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:33,179
that is um so the real big issues

192
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,130
occurred when we tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move from an</font>

193
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,449
informal process and let me ask how many

194
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,020
people here have done something they

195
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,120
would call threat modeling maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third</font>

196
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,780
of you do you have do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

197
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:49,209
documentation going in do you have any

198
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:51,399
forms you needed to fill out um

199
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:55,479
a couple of you have and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

200
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't and as we tried to write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

201
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,329
what people were doing we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

202
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">down a comprehensive view of everything</font>

203
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:06,609
they might do as they<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through this</font>

204
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,610
process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that resulted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this very</font>

205
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:13,389
complex process it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was 11 or so steps</font>

206
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,429
and if you had say Michael or window or

207
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:18,040
Jason garms or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our other</font>

208
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:20,319
long-standing experts in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

209
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,329
worked really really well some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

210
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:24,998
teams who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this have great</font>

211
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:27,160
results and we took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and we exported</font>

212
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:30,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we said it's really important that</font>

213
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,079
the engineers<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved because when</font>

214
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,179
they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved they buy into the</font>

215
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:35,679
process and they buy into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results if</font>

216
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:38,439
you have the experts show up and say

217
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,449
this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes wrong then the</font>

218
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:42,160
engineer says yeah yeah hang on i'm

219
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:44,199
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this feature but if you pull</font>

220
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,139
the engineer in and have them

221
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:49,199
participate in the process of

222
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:51,100
understanding what might go wrong of

223
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:54,008
participating<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the threat modeling</font>

224
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,110
process then when they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

225
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,629
write the code they will remember those

226
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,209
things and so it's tremendously

227
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:04,480
important to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process to</font>

228
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:06,758
development the next issue we run into

229
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they threw out</font>

230
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,049
models start out by saying first

231
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,610
enumerate your assets and then think

232
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:16,179
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how an attacker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get to them</font>

233
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:19,839
well when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask everyone to that model</font>

234
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:22,660
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask say the GDI team to threat model</font>

235
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,519
GDI graphics direct interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're a</font>

236
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,860
graphics library they don't own any

237
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,779
assets the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to write to the</font>

238
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,480
screen is a privilege it's a right it's

239
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:33,220
not an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asset and they throw up their</font>

240
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,179
hands and said we'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this but</font>

241
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,040
we just don't know what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

242
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,749
connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> or similar to disconnect it</font>

243
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
from development we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask people to write</font>

244
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:43,660
these throughout models and then we

245
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,660
didn't we didn't really encourage them

246
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,549
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything with them and so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

247
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,179
apply the<font color="#CCCCCC"> y agony principle if you ain't</font>

248
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:53,589
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> need if um often times throughout</font>

249
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:55,899
models look like something you ain't

250
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:58,449
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need and something you just zip</font>

251
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:00,459
through it was hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell if your</font>

252
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,498
models were complete if it was hard to

253
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,279
tell if they were up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to date or accurate</font>

254
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:06,669
you know there were these very

255
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,219
disconnected artifacts and so there's

256
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:11,559
this long long list of pain points

257
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:14,769
associated with the process and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

258
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:17,589
result of that is this profusion of

259
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:20,019
attempts to fix ish we had an awful lot

260
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,999
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people step out and say okay the</font>

261
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,789
process coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the central teams</font>

262
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:28,209
isn't working for me I'll fix it I'll do

263
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:30,579
better and we we've had a tremendous

264
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:34,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of those and a lot of really</font>

265
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:36,968
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting innovation that lead up to</font>

266
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:38,889
the present day and so what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

267
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:41,589
do now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually walk you through the</font>

268
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">process as we advise teams to do it</font>

269
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:47,199
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and from there I'm</font>

270
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:50,139
going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk about some of the</font>

271
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:52,029
some of the toolbox<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we used to come</font>

272
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:55,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and why it looks</font>

273
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:58,839
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is um but before I do I want</font>

274
00:11:55,689 --> 00:12:01,179
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that we it was explicitly built</font>

275
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,489
around fixing the problems that we were

276
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,909
experiencing we went from 11 steps to

277
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:10,059
for one of the problems that we ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

278
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:11,289
this jargon overload problem was you

279
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:13,868
would go into a room you would start

280
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,669
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people and inside of 60</font>

281
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:17,859
seconds you would use so many acronyms

282
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:20,259
that they didn't understand and had no

283
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:22,629
reference for that they were convinced

284
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:24,699

285
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:26,919
what's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want them</font>

286
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:28,358
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this work and the way that they</font>

287
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:30,369
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't want them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

288
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:32,799
this work is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they got so just</font>

289
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:38,470
connected from what you were saying that

290
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:40,858
they tuned ouch um products to do is an

291
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,629
internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug tracking system that we use</font>

292
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's getting phased out in favor of TFS</font>

293
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:48,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">over time so we've integrated into the</font>

294
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:52,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">development process through bug tracking</font>

295
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:54,069
um we we focus on the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

296
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:56,559
attacker there's this advice that people

297
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:57,969
love to give and how many people have

298
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,029
ever said you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think like an</font>

299
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:05,049
attacker come on you can put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

300
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:06,729
up it's okay um how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you have</font>

301
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:11,559
ever said you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think like a</font>

302
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:13,479
professional chef um for us it's easy to

303
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">think like attackers we know what</font>

304
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:19,839
attackers do we come to conferences like

305
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:21,819
this we see how attacks work I'm willing

306
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">to bet that there's less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than two people</font>

307
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:26,378
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> room who have worked a</font>

308
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:28,720
professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> kitchen and can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

309
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:31,259
plan a menu and get hundreds of orders

310
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
out over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> course of an evening and</font>

311
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,029
when you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone who is a</font>

312
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,709
professional software developer that

313
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:40,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't understand security you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:42,248
think like an attacker it's very much

315
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:44,529
like coming to you and saying think like

316
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:47,409
a professional chef or think like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

317
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:49,509
accountant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we've pulled away from</font>

318
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:54,129
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we focus on the software and</font>

319
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:55,419
how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> software is built um we</font>

320
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,429
encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> throughout models as a</font>

321
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:59,769
collaboration tool we encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

322
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:01,929
to say as part of discussions they have

323
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:07,059
with other teams can I see your threat

324
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:09,429
model and when other people ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

325
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,929
out model what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found is that your</font>

326
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:14,699
pride of ownership your pride of

327
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:16,929
authorship increases so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

328
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:19,659
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage the behavior</font>

329
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:21,098
would like to see I having it not come

330
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:25,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the central team but having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

331
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:26,919
come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your peers um when we do</font>

332
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:29,709
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give people a way to</font>

333
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:31,720
understand whether or not what they've

334
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,419
done is correct whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not what</font>

335
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,949
they've done is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> good because if</font>

336
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:38,079
you want to make it good and you don't

337
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:39,998
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> good looks like you're not</font>

338
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,488
going to get anywhere and so we've put

339
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:47,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">in large number of self checks in the</font>

340
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:48,429
process both locally as as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

341
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:50,498
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process here's what you</font>

342
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,669
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're drawing a diagram here's</font>

343
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:53,589
what you check is your enumerated

344
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,779
threats and at the end there's an

345
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:57,789
explicit validation stage which is

346
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed to give people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to</font>

347
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:02,769
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and validate their own crap</font>

348
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:05,259
model we look at threats as bugs we look

349
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:08,709
at mitigations as features and there are

350
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:10,720
some teams that look at mitigations as

351
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:14,049
or that look at valle nur abilities as

352
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,119
bugs but the key here is that people

353
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:18,579
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run how to deal with bugs</font>

354
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:20,859
and they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to write features and</font>

355
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,910
so when you go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

356
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:24,430
threats and vulnerabilities

357
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:27,459
our abilities to bugs and features you

358
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:31,540
connect your audience gets it they say

359
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,970
oh yeah if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a bug I can deal</font>

360
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,939
with this I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> triage yeah I can assign</font>

361
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,140
it to someone I can test it and I can

362
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,760
make sure it's not in the shipping

363
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:44,410
product I got it or if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't feet</font>

364
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,930
mitigation a way to prevent a threat say

365
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,060
encryption that's a feature people know

366
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,329
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write features you can spec them</font>

367
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:55,329
you can code then you can test<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you</font>

368
00:15:52,330 --> 00:16:00,520
can make sure they're documented and so

369
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:02,530
we're really trying to adjust the

370
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,900
problems that people have experienced

371
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,449
both in the process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the training</font>

372
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we deliver one of the versions of</font>

373
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> training that we delivered had this</font>

374
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,710
really great slide up at the front which

375
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:18,580
showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quality assessment of our</font>

376
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:21,340
threat models and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say it was</font>

377
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,710
poor that the average strap model<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

378
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,560
very good and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the second</font>

379
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,080
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the training now if I were to</font>

380
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,849
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and say I'm going to give you</font>

381
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,980
a bad talk about something and you're

382
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,990
going to not understand it at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

383
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when I asked you to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this you're</font>

384
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a crappy job I assume you'd</font>

385
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,339
all continue paying attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

386
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,230
you're here on a Saturday to learn about

387
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,520
security stuff but if you were doing

388

anything else if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're out there</font>

389
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:51,579
enjoying the sunlight then perhaps your

390
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:54,550
response would be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little different so</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a bridged</font>

version a very abridged version of the

393
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,329
internal process training that we

394
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,000
deliver and it has five basic steps<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

395
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:10,449
start out with some vision and some

396
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,079
requirements build a model identify

397
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:16,270
threats mitigate those threats and

398
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,280
validate what you've done if you change

399
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,099
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make changes as you make</font>

400
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,540
architectural changes to the process go

401
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,879
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make sure your model actually</font>

402
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,430
reflect your reality now if you look at

403
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,410
this this looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about every</font>

other four stage process you've ever

familiar

407
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,779
makes it easier for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap their</font>

408

head around what's new and hard here

00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:44,980
rather than oh my god there's 11 boxes

410
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:47,350
in a complex flow chart so the vision

<font color="#E5E5E5">the vision thing the vision thing</font>

412
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,090
involves encouraging people to push

413
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:55,539
security into the things that they're

already doing their scenarios<font color="#E5E5E5"> their use</font>

cases puts your security in there if

416
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:04,090
you're using personas we use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

persona driven design ask yourself what

<font color="#E5E5E5">does this user expect would happen and</font>

what does this user<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried would happen</font>

420
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,850
think about where the product is going

knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in there's a lot of</font>

427
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,129
intuitive knowledge there's a lot of

428
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,959
knowledge baked into teams and so we

429
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,190
find that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people can actually do this</font>

430
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good results on a very</font>

431
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,769
informal basis and that's tremendously

432
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,500
useful because it allows them even

433
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">before they start to draw a design to</font>

434
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,470
think about how they can enhance that

design for security<font color="#CCCCCC"> the assurances</font>

436
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,029

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,860
working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's new and it's a</font>

438
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:01,750
structured way to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

439
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,299
you're telling customers about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

440
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,700
product security for example what would

441
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:08,470
we tell people about BitLocker security

442
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:13,059
what would we tell people about UAC

443
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:16,659
security and the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

444
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:19,149
instruction is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you act make</font>

445
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:21,940
short positive statements of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font>

00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:24,279
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> this user can do this or only this</font>

447
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,529
person can do that because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it</font>

448
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,090
really easy to drive bugs oh this user

449
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:29,679
can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it's not covered in</font>

450
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,709
one of the assurance statements we have

451
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,480
a problem that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'll</font>

452
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:38,889
probably talk about again more in the

453
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,779
future so model<font color="#E5E5E5"> um stir with the diagram</font>

454
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:43,059
start with a white board level diagram

455
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,370
on everyone in software knows how to

456
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:48,570
draw diagrams on

457
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">whiteboard and thread model diagrams</font>

458
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,100
really aren't that different from your

459
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,680
whiteboard level diagram so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always</font>

460
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,110
start with an external interactor the

461
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,450
someone outside who is driving the story

462
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,550
them about to tell they're going to talk

463
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,840
to some process some running code is

464
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,210
going to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> with their</font>

465
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,520
instructions maybe it has some

466
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,830
persistent data that its stores and then

467
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,050
you connect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all up and that's a</font>

468
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:16,379
context diagram for a threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> model it's</font>

469
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:19,320
really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do that you can you</font>

470
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,330
can check<font color="#CCCCCC"> your work right you can tell a</font>

471
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,340
story using the diagram and if you have

472
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:26,010
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whiteboard your</font>

473
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,230
diagram isn't complete fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but you've</font>

474
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,120
got a whiteboard so it's easy and then

475
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:35,610
you can break it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out into more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

476
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:37,559
detail as you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that um so we</font>

477
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,678
encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to use these five</font>

478
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,139
diagram element types external entities

479
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,750
anyone outside the system processes are

480
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,540
all running code data stores and data

481
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,700
flow or data flows data stores and then

482
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,110
trust boundaries some of you who have

483
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,730
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying a lot of attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

484
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,159
throughout modeling may notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

485
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,290
we've eliminated this double circle

486
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,090
thing that used to be there because no

487
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:02,040
one could actually give clear advice on

488
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,428
when to use what it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex</font>

489
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:08,639
process what makes a complex process in

490
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:10,230
a threat model I had an intuitive grasp

491
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,460
and I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write it down and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

492
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,800
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I asked some of my</font>

493
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,890
colleagues and they couldn't and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

494
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">just gone um so if you see in other</font>

495
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:22,410
documents that's that's why so once

496
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,270
you've drawn these diagrams I said add

497
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,910
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail when needed and that's</font>

498
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:30,150
really fuzzy advice too that's the sort

499
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:32,550
of advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I hate on and so I had to</font>

500
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">get prescriptive about what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

501
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:38,100
do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break it out and it's really um</font>

502
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:41,220
that you need more detail to fully

503
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:44,730
explain the security impact the other

504
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,740
place that it happens is an object would

505
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,840
cross a trust boundary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look</font>

506
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,090
to the formal isms of what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DFD with a</font>

507
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,929
trust boundary is trust boundaries are

508
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:57,209
only ever supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cross a data flow</font>

509
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,370
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to yell at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who would</font>

510
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,140
draw their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jade their trust boundaries</font>

511
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,030
across databases or they would draw

512
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,890
their trust boundaries across a process

513
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we realized that what what they were</font>

514
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,870
really doing was expressing something

515
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,939
very important they were expressing that

516
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,340
there was this detail there that they

517
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,830
knew intuitively that the two sides of

518
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,480
that boundary were different and so

519
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,000
rather than telling them don't do that

520
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,130
we say that's great that's wonderful do

521
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,070
what you want to do put the trust

522
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,900
boundary there and then break it out you

523
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,669
also found that people would say things

524
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,050
like well sometimes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> database you</font>

525
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,150
know if you were modeling say an online

526
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:38,100
bookstore sometimes this database

527
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,550
contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> our inventory of books and</font>

528
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,719
sometimes it contains our credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> cards</font>

529
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:45,240
logically that's two different databases

530
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,520
you might have one big sequel store that

531
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,890
holds all of it but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logical</font>

532
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,360
perspective from an apple perspective

533
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,890
from an audit perspective they're

534
00:22:51,360 --> 00:23:02,820
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so treat them</font>

535
00:22:52,890 --> 00:23:04,440
differently so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step so the next</font>

536
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">step in the process and I should I</font>

537
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,020
should point out we've got this little

538
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:15,650
little doohickey to remind you where you

539
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:17,760
where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are um is identify threats and</font>

540
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,850
most of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here can identify</font>

541
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,260
threats looking at a diagram if we if I

542
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,990
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whiteboard here and i drew</font>

543
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,150
something and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said hey let's attack it</font>

544
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,910
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a prize for who cuts of the</font>

545
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:33,330
best attack guys would be all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over it</font>

546
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,160
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of Engineers how do we</font>

547
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:40,260
attack that and they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> buffer</font>

548
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:45,240
overflow SSL sequel injection you didn't

549
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">get good clear responses and so we have</font>

550
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,010
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> people clear guidance as to what</font>

551
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:53,760
we want and the methodology that we're

552
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:58,650
using today is what we call stride per

553
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:01,710
element and what this is is if you're

554
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:03,540
considering a data store you worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

555
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,780
people tampering with it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about</font>

556
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,399
the data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it being disclosed you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry</font>

557
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">about denial</font>

558
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,650
of service and then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that red</font>

559
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">check there which is repudiation sorry</font>

560
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:19,380
in writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> bid repudiation doesn't</font>

561
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,419
really fit and if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data store is a</font>

562
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,850
log you have to worry about repudiation

563
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,620
if you have a data flow between two

564
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,540
things you worry about tampering

565
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,389
information disclosure and denial of

566
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,600
service if you have an external entity

567
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about spoofing and repudiation</font>

568
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,040
now I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really clear that this</font>

569

<font color="#CCCCCC">is the chart that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using and it's</font>

570
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,590
primarily driven by the sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

571
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:46,290
for which we would ship updates there

572
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,240
are interesting security problems which

573
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,520
are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blank space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this chart</font>

574
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,070
which may matter deeply to your

00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,350
organization to your customers my

576
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,159
favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> example is information</font>

577

disclosure by external entities

578
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,400
information disclosure by external

579
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,939
entity sounds a lot like a privacy

580
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,180
breach and if you're a fan of the

586
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,380
question to the previous speaker about

who's getting fired because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

analyze that stuff it turns out that a

602
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,110

605
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,800
they'll chop it off of the chart and

606

your authentication and authorization

607
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,260
processes will get all messed up was

608
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:19,050
there a question in the map I should say

609
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,030
if I'm not being<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear please feel free</font>

that I use in giving the training where

619
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,420
and I I don't want to spend time walking

620
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,100
you through it but the threats that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

621
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,470
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the opposites of the</font>

622
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,990
properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would like to have</font>

623
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,960
and we define them and give examples of

624
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,770
each of them that people can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

625
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,100
look at so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from threat</font>

626
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:14,040
identification to mitigation um it

627
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:17,580
doesn't actually do you any good and it

628
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:20,490
may harm you substantially to go through

629
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,629
the process up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and stop because</font>

630
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,820
what you've done is you've done an

631
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,340
analysis of your secure of your design

632
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:30,149
or you've written out your design you've

633
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:33,199
analyzed that design and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you know</font>

634
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this set of problems and you stop</font>

635
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,630
someone's lawyers are going to love you

636
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:42,450
for that so you have to address each

637
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,160
threat and there are four primary ways

638
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,390
that you can do that you can redesign

639
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,250
the thing you're working on um you know

640
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,950
put in a reference monitor make sure

641
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,290
that everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

642
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:57,270
authorization scheme etc you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

643
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">these standard mitigations and by</font>

644
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,950
standard mitigations what I mean are

645
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:06,900
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles and cryptography and</font>

646
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:10,980
digital signatures on using prepared

647
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,930
statements in your sequel system on you

648
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,890
can also look to what similar software

649
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:20,100
packages have done and how their various

650
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:23,310
defenses have worked out for them one of

651
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">the very useful things about responsible</font>

652
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,919
disclosure or<font color="#E5E5E5"> even full disclosure is</font>

653
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,610
that you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look to this set</font>

654
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,559
of attack

655
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,439
against things similar to what you are

656
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,389
building and learn from it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is often</font>

657
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">also an expert activity to sit down</font>

658
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:42,120
analyze the attack apply it to your own

659
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:44,679
product but it's tremendously powerful

660
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:49,199
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> invent a new mitigation you're</font>

661
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:51,250
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new and software um then</font>

662
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,510
you might have to come up with a new way

663
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,730
to address a problem then that's

664
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,250
tremendously risky for reasons that I

665
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,630
think all of you have experienced the

666
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,280
final<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you might do is you can</font>

667
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,770
accept a vulnerability in your design

668
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,510
inside of Microsoft we have rules and

669
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,900
policies about what you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

670
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:10,780
accept and it's great to set these up

671
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:18,210
before you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process so that you</font>

672
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:20,530
can make clear calls on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so</font>

673
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:25,240
validation you have to validate the

674
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:27,070
whole threat model and you can and there

675
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,049
are some steps you can do again this is

676
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,178
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> making it prescriptive so that an</font>

677
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:34,120
engineer can do it without the expert

678
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:39,460
handy does your diagram match your code

679
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:42,280
can you enumerate your rats um have

680
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,100
testers looked at the frat model I find

681
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:50,230
the test getting tests involved in

682
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:52,449
security is a win-win testers have some

683
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,730
of that security mentality that Bruce

684
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,679
Schneier talks about they have some of

685
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,780
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wonder what happens when I poke</font>

686
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,470
it or I wonder what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I poke it</font>

687
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,870
again look it falls apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they might</font>

688
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,030
not have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills necessary to</font>

689
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,760
understand how to poke things in

690
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,740
security relevant ways but they have a

691
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,010
lot of the same approaches and getting

692
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:18,210
them involved often finds both issues

693
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:22,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">with your threat model and issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

694
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,770
the details of the attacks and then you

695
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:26,049
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask yourself as you validate</font>

696
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,090
your threat model it have I mitigated

697
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:31,360
each threat did I do the mitigations

698
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:33,610
correctly and we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of examples</font>

699
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go through here</font>

700
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:38,139
how am i doing on time

701
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I realized I forgot my water I've been a</font>

702
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:44,860
half hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay excellent either I'm</font>

703
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:46,690
doing well or you're all really tired I

704
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,659
hope I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but if you have</font>

705
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,400
questions please again oh yeah finally

706
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:57,940
it's important to trap model at the

707
00:30:51,400 --> 00:31:00,010
right time analyzing their attack

708
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,470
pattern when the rebel ships are

709
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,810
attacking the Death Star it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

710
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:10,480
late to make important design changes

711
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:12,399
they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build another one so try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

712
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,770
do this early in the process rather than

713
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:21,220
late so going going<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the future both</font>

714
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:23,320
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> stl and what we're doing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

715
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,440
modeling and here here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to talk</font>

716
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,710
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some of the possibilities</font>

717
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,500
as I hope you pick up on throughout

718
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,810
modeling and actually go Jewish so

719
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,210
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of trap</font>

720
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,250
modeling you can make your threat models

721
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,080
asset centric you can make them attacker

722
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,660
centric you can make them architecture

723
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,970
centric or software centric you can prep

724
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,340
model network protocols this is the core

725
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:51,790
of that security considerations section

726
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:54,970
in every RFC there are lots of others

727
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:57,490
there's not a right way or wrong way to

728
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,340
do this there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more and less</font>

729
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:03,790
effective ways for organizations to do

730
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,340
this and so what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you do</font>

731
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:09,129
is think about threat modeling as a tool

732
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,379
that you can use a little bit about what

733
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,330
true lling can look like and how you can

734
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:17,770
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about software for some modeling</font>

735
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:20,290
so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually assess the various</font>

736
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:23,500
possibilities right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I listed for I said</font>

737
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:26,530
there's a lot more and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

738
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:30,700
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of important future in thinking</font>

739
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:32,139
better about security tools and in

740
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the design</font>

741
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:38,140
trade-offs that we make are and this

742
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,720
this is getting a little philosophical

743
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:44,890
so please just bear with me for a minute

744
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,570
or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm going to talk about how</font>

745
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,690
and why to think about design and

746
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,210
usability for programmers

747
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,490
technique called flow which I found to

748
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">be incredibly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful to me as a process</font>

749
00:32:53,490 --> 00:33:00,720
designer and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk through</font>

750
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,040
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then address for each of them</font>

751
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,400
what does this have to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> drought</font>

752
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">modeling so when you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about buying</font>

753
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,260
a car most people have bought a car

754
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,639
there's an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can</font>

755
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can think about how many</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people you need you can think about</font>

762
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,700
reason might be because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

763
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,909
project that image of wealth and there's

764
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,950
a tremendous market for all sorts of

765
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,530
cars some of which I look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

766
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">say why would anyone buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:42,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">truth is someone does because I just</font>

768
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked at it so some car company spent</font>

769
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,990
the time and effort to build this car

770
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,820
market it and then someone bought it and

771
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,270
now it's sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of me blocking</font>

772
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:54,020
my view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the road and</font>

773
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's a good thing and</font>

774
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:59,610
oftentimes as we've talked about threat

775
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:02,220
modeling will talk about the one true

776
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:05,550
way we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the way we</font>

777
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,740
do it and the implication is this is the

778
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:11,070
way you should do it that's totally

779
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:14,400
wrong threat modeling as a set of ways

780
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:17,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">to approach design or to approach the</font>

781
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,200
analysis of software should be a big

782
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,020
tent because the requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

783
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,719
have are different you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like buying</font>

784
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,909
a car if you need to transport a family

785
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,480
of eight you need a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different car</font>

786
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:32,399
than if you're in a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> person if</font>

787
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,170
you're deploying this at a large

788
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,360
software company you might have a very

789
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,460
different methodology than if you're

790
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">applying it at a consultancy if you're</font>

791
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,409
applying<font color="#E5E5E5"> it say a device medical device</font>

792
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,509
manufacturer there's all sorts of

793
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:48,270
processes which we will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

794
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the next few years each</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of which</font>

795
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">solves a problem that someone has and</font>

796
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,409
it's important to understand what your

797
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,880
problem is why you're changing the

798
00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,529
process because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to drive</font>

799
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,530
how you change the process

800
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:10,990
um so one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

801
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,640
tremendously important for all of

802
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,069
security this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going way beyond</font>

803
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">throughout modeling is thinking about</font>

804
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,650
developers as human beings um there was

805
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">a great paper by todd miller and</font>

806
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:28,960
Theodore van on stir l copy and stir out

807
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:30,670
if people read this paper anyone no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">openbsd source um for misuse of stir and</font>

812
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:45,790
copy and stir and cash note those are

813
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,470
the inversions those are the versions

814
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,779
where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say yeah copy these</font>

815
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,839
two strings or copy this into that

816
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:57,810
buffer um you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to provide a</font>

817
00:35:52,840 --> 00:36:01,180
length value and people messed it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

818
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:03,279
in the course of writing the paper what

819
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,950
they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was they analyzed the ways in</font>

820
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,490
which people messed it up and they said

821
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:11,980
there are some patterns that we see

822
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:14,680
people have a bad mental model of stir

823
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,320
and copy and because they have this bad

824
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,990
mental model they make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same mistakes</font>

825
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,200
over and over again and so what did they

826
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:25,029
do they didn't go out and say we're

827
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,339
going to change everyone's mental model

828
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:30,070
that's hard work what they did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

829
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:32,259
designed a set of copy functions that

830
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:35,740
conformed to the model that their users

831
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,080
expected them to have ah and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

832
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:41,169
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clever approach to the problem um</font>

833
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,089
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usability isn't just about your mom</font>

834
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,880
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about your grandmother it's</font>

835
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:49,119
about programmers it's about security

836
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:54,609
people I can't tell you how many cool

837
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,200
security tools I've wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use had 15</font>

838
00:36:54,609 --> 00:37:01,480
minutes to figure out whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not I</font>

839
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">could use them and gave up you know when</font>

840
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,890
John found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different tool which may or</font>

841
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:08,020
may not have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> as fit for purpose as</font>

842
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,480
the first one I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at but it</font>

843
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,830
was easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to understand I was</font>

844
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">under a tight deadline</font>

845
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:19,890
and I had to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> something new quickly</font>

846
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:23,020
so usability<font color="#E5E5E5"> is key for programmers and</font>

847
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:26,589
you don't need to be an expert to make

848
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:29,380
usable software it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not that</font>

849
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:31,360
hard it's hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make software that has</font>

850
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,090
beautiful usability it's hard to make

851
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,180
software that has great usability but

852
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:39,880
it's easy to make software which has a

853
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:42,940
baseline<font color="#CCCCCC"> of usability and the way the</font>

854
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:47,230
basic simple way that you do it is you

855
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:48,850
watch users and shut up you sit down and

856
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,360
you hand someone the software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

857
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:54,460
want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use and you say do this</font>

858
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,960
thing which which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a key purpose of</font>

859
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,720
the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know let's say it's</font>

860
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">nmap and you want to do a test scan a</font>

861
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,680
box over there on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and you</font>

862
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:05,470
just sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and watch them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

863
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,890
notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the first couple of times that</font>

864
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:11,080
you do this you cringe you cry it's

865
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,790
awful it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so painful because they're</font>

866
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,279
missing the obvious thing that's right

867
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:18,400
down in the corner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen in very</font>

868
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">very low contrast text which is a key</font>

869
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,650
thing you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like my copy</font>

870
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,779
write things down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in a very bottom</font>

871
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:27,250
left-hand side of the screen it's low

872
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,130
contrast because I don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to draw</font>

873
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:33,550
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye to it but I've seen important</font>

874
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:36,580
switches for software that are that hard

875
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:39,850
to find that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command line isn't well</font>

876
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:43,210
documented or that you need a string of

877
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:45,339
like seven different command options to

878
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,050
do this really common basic things

879
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,360
everyone wants to do and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the</font>

880
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,610
man page in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the example section at lists</font>

881
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,590
you how to do this here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font>

882
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:56,890
things then you read other manual pages

883
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:58,270
and they say oh yeah here's an option

884
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,270
that gives you all of these common

885
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,650
defaults that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to want there</font>

886
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,640
are some techniques and I'm not going to

887
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:09,040
delve into these but paper prototyping

888
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:12,759
the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is you take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Vizio or</font>

889
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,680
Photoshop or even a whiteboard then you

890
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,110
just draw what you're planning to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

891
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,290
and you show it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and say if I</font>

892
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,520
wanted you to use this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

893
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,740
what would you do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you look</font>

894
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,930
for and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them these paper</font>

895
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,970
prototypes they're very

896
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,470
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you answers and you</font>

897
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,470
haven't done any code writing so it's

898
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:33,118
easy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to redesign you do</font>

899
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:36,029
your design up front with a paper

900
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,040
prototype you can ask people using your

901
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:44,520
software to think aloud to say yeah um

902
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:46,109
so I want to scan this machine um so the

903
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing I'm going to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just try</font>

904
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:51,808
and map and the Machine name and see

905
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,569
what that delivers and you know and map

906
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:56,220
is cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or you might give</font>

907
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:59,190
them another task which is give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a</font>

908
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:01,828
list of all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open UDP ports on the</font>

909
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:05,359
machine and the default UDP scan only

910
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:07,559
goes one<font color="#CCCCCC"> two 1024 so do they actually</font>

911
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,619
discover that or do<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just give you</font>

912
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:14,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the open ports on machine the open ports</font>

913
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:18,599
from one to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 for another great</font>

914
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:21,329
technique is personas right down um Abby

915
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:25,079
is a mom who uses her computer for a few

916
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours a week toby is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her teenage son</font>

917
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,109
he's into p2p file-sharing plays

918
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:34,710
first-person shooters and knows his

919
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:36,420
mom's password um so you write these

920
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:40,849
things down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and set and then you can ask</font>

921
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:44,490
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a be u Zen map or</font>

922
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:46,770
how would Toby<font color="#CCCCCC"> use n map and you can go</font>

923
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the mental exercise of saying</font>

924
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,900
how would I actually engage with this

925
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,819
all three of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very useful all</font>

926
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,339
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them there's a tremendous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

927
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:58,500
depth in doing them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perfection</font>

928
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:01,349
there's depth and doing them well but

929
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,630
taking a first step pays off

930
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:08,750
tremendously on almost everything I've

931
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,750
ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked on so</font>

932
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:14,710
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a concept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

933
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:17,080
psychology called flow and flow is this

934
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,150
state where the person is fully immersed

935
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,069
in what he or<font color="#CCCCCC"> she is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and it's</font>

936
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,870
characterized by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling of energized</font>

937
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:28,120
focused full involvement and success and

938
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:30,130
there's a set of these um there's

939
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,250
elements that lead to flow there's clear

940
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,750
goals there's concentration and focus

941
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,780
actually before I say this on the

942
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,250
psychologist who came up with this idea

943
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,320
did it because he discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font>

944
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,420
talking to people who were successful in

945
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:47,260
a wide variety of fields in rock

946
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:49,510
climbing in surgery in chess all of

947
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:52,620
these people used remarkably similar

948
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:55,660
words to describe what it was they were

949
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,460
experiencing as they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged in</font>

950
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,980
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which they were highly</font>

951
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:04,240
skilled and those elements involved

952
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:06,370
goals concentration a loss of feeling of

953
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">self consciousness going back to our</font>

954
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:11,560
previous speaker a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of questions</font>

955
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">were about mumbling they were about what</font>

956
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,890
do you do if you're scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

957
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,450
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that feeling of self</font>

958
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:21,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">cot of self-consciousness that if you</font>

959
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,620
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling self-conscious about what</font>

960
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:26,410
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it is hard to focus on</font>

961
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:29,680
what it is you're doing if I'm standing

962
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:32,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">here very worried about are these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

963
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,970
paying attention did I button my shirt

964
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:38,710
um do I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something hanging off my</font>

965
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:41,169
lip from lunch I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> self-conscious I'm</font>

966
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,930
not focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on providing you with this</font>

967
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:45,970
information there's this distorted self

968
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:48,339
of time I get up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I don't</font>

969
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:51,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily have a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solid idea of</font>

970
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:55,510
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> long I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking um there's</font>

971
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:57,279
direct and immediate feedback um asking

972
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:00,190
people to raise their hand asking

973
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,860
questions as I'm speaking here it helps

974
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know if I'm connecting with you or</font>

975
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">not there's the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is absolutely</font>

976
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:11,920
key there's this balance between ability

977
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:14,530
level and challenge for most of you if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

978
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:18,070
asked you to cook dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect that</font>

979
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:20,830
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to starve on cooking one</font>

980
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,829
dinner and cooking 500 dinners totally

981
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:24,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">different levels</font>

982
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:26,089
challenge and most of you will be up to

983
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:28,190
cooking dinner for a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and not</font>

984
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:30,430
up to cooking dinner for a few hundred

985
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:34,430
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're there's this balance between</font>

986
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:36,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability and challenge there's a sense of</font>

987
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:40,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">control over the situation or activity</font>

988
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:42,440
it's rewarding in some way and people

989
00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:44,420
become absorbed and so you may be asking

990
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself what the hell is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy</font>

991
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,009
talking about how does any of this

992
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:52,009
relate to threat modeling and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer</font>

993
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:54,650
is as I did interviews and as I talked

994
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:57,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">to people about their threat modeling</font>

995
00:43:54,650 --> 00:44:00,709
experience I happen to be reading on

psychology of optimal experience and it

998
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:09,890
just kept slapping me in the face what a

00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:12,079
good description of threat modeling or

1000
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,578
how little a description of threat

1001
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,099
modeling had to do with a flow

1002
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:20,269
experience and how much it had to do

1003

with a failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to engage on an awful lot</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these points and so there's this</font>

diagram which which he has and over on

1006
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:33,229
the left side is challenges high to low

1007
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:36,829
and on the bottom of skills low to high

1008
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:39,589
and the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn you</font>

you start out at point a where you have

<font color="#E5E5E5">no skill and very little challenge and</font>

for the xbox talk about this that intro

1013

level that all games have is point a

1014
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:57,829
point a in a first-person shooter is

1015
00:44:55,279 --> 00:45:00,380
about giving you a low challenge low

1016
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:02,749
skill set of things so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn</font>

1017
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,529
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually go out and engage the</font>

1018
00:45:02,749 --> 00:45:09,558
monster and then a well-designed game

1019
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:13,640
delivers to you new items new vehicles

1020
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:16,430
new skills or new new skills for your

1021
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,459
character within the game and so as you

1022
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:22,459
play it unlocks more and more of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1023
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:24,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what happens is you know you go pick</font>

1024
00:45:22,459 --> 00:45:26,089
up the grenade launcher and you go from

1025
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,709
A to B you're a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> anxious you don't</font>

1026
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:28,999
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire the grenade launcher</font>

1027
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:31,629
you don't know how big<font color="#CCCCCC"> the grenade</font>

1028
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:33,430
launchers on impact

1029
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:36,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">be and then you play with it a little</font>

1030
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:38,799
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you move to point D you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

1031
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:42,580
into this flow channel because you've

1032
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,980
learned how to do this um now if the

1033
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,990
game doesn't actually add any challenges

1034
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,270
as you're playing then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get bored and</font>

1035
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,950
probably from Point C you go to point

1036
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:54,730
somewhere else where you put the game

1037
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:57,790
down and do different things so going

1038
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:03,570
into threat modeling what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to</font>

1039
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:08,950
do is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide people with the set of</font>

1040
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:11,410
instructions for going from say point A

1041
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:13,930
they need to draw a DFT they need to

1042
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:15,850
draw a data flow diagram and we've told

1043
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:17,740
them you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like a</font>

1044
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:19,509
whiteboard diagram oh I've got some

1045
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,850
rules of thumb I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm doing the</font>

1046
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:24,490
right thing I've learned that I go on to

1047
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:28,270
my next challenge which used to be I

1048
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:32,049
need to brainstorm now it's you stride

1049
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:34,860
per element as a way to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to get</font>

1050
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this stage of i need to actually</font>

1051
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:42,280
enumerate threats and so there's a very

1052
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">conscious approach that we've used and</font>

1053
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:49,240
that we've had success with of break it

1054
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:52,600
down into small pieces for each of those

1055
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,430
small pieces give people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a challenge and</font>

1056
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,980
then a way to validate that they're

1057
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:58,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually doing the right thing so that</font>

1058
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,630
they don't spend too long in that

1059
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:03,820
anxiety zone and that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1060
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:12,100
go through the whole process and get you

1061
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:14,050
a result and feel good about it so what

1062
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hold in threat</font>

1063
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:19,240
modeling I think there's going to be a

1064
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,980
tremendously diverse set of threat

1065
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,859
modeling processes out there there's

1066
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:26,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">process and tools which work for the</font>

1067
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,030
problem at hand not just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

1068
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have at Microsoft and that I've</font>

1069
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:33,310
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on solving I think there</font>

1070
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:35,500
are problems where each of you might be

1071
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:38,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use threat modeling techniques</font>

1072
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:40,369
to a jadu design analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the work</font>

1073
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:43,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you do</font>

1074
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:45,230
and that if you come and select one of

1075
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,509
these systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will work for</font>

1076
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,749
whatever project it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and whether</font>

1077
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:52,130
that's asset driven attacker driven

1078
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:54,078
software-driven you know if your

1079
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:58,730
development process is very waterfall or

1080
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,200
very agile if you have a bunch of

1081
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:02,779
experts or if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to involve</font>

1082
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,788
everyone or whatever sort of process

1083
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:07,549
you're looking at you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually apply</font>

1084
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:09,769
this and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> modify and to work for</font>

1085
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:13,160
the problems which you're experiencing

1086
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:16,879
um so I've tried to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guidance</font>

1087
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:20,480
here both on the very philosophical end

1088
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,849
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the very practical end because I</font>

1089
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,559
believe both are important how you can

1090
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:26,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually engage in the process the way</font>

1091
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,390
that Microsoft doesn't and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1092
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:31,579
philosophy that lies behind that so that

1093
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:35,089
you can actually modify it to work for

1094
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:36,769
you and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like I'd like to have a</font>

1095
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:39,170
little call for action here I'd like you

1096
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:40,939
to go and actually threat model things

1097
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,789
and I'd like you to enjoy yourself as

1098
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,529
you do it's a fun process if you threat

1099
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:47,599
model nothing else<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not model the</font>

1100
00:48:45,529 --> 00:48:51,799
security line at the airport on your way

1101
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,960
home ask yourself how would I how would

1102
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:56,480
I attack this and then take it a step

1103
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,730
further right once you've got a couple

1104
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,890
of attacks how would I help someone

1105
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:03,559
who's not a security expert do this

1106
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:06,288
thing how would I give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of</font>

1107
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:10,160
questions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of mental techniques</font>

1108
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:13,039
to do what I just did so enjoy yourself

1109
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,980
as you do this choose a system that

1110
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:20,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">works for you and make sure that you do</font>

1111
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:23,059
it at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been blogging</font>

1112
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:25,669
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this on the security</font>

1113
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:30,529
development lifecycle blog at blogs joy

1114
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:31,880
msdn calm / sdl and so with that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1115
00:49:30,529 --> 00:49:36,279
we've got a fair amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1116
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:36,279
questions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions yes</font>

1117
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:55,579
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font>

1118
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,170
sdl is expansive and where do you start

1119
00:49:55,579 --> 00:50:00,859
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization is going to be</font>

1120
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:03,859
resistant to it on let me answer that in

1121
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:07,308
two parts the the first technical and

1122
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:13,400
the second organizational um on a

1123
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:15,079
technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with I'm</font>

1124
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,069
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flip that around actually and</font>

1125
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:17,660
I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer on the</font>

1126
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:19,390
organizational level and then the

1127
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:22,160
technical level because it influences it

1128
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:26,868
on the organizational level I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1129
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:29,690
need two things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need you need some</font>

1130
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:31,549
success story which you can use to

1131
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:35,289
convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that this is a</font>

1132
00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:37,430
worthwhile investment of resources and

1133
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:38,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dependent on your</font>

1134
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,839
organization we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

1135
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:43,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit offline if you'd like but at</font>

1136
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,910
Microsoft there were a series of events

1137
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that led to a strong level of executive</font>

1138
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:52,759
support and the executive support

1139
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,740
dovetailed with work that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1140
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,430
mike howard and jayson garms<font color="#CCCCCC"> had been</font>

1141
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:01,098
doing to actually develop these

1142
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,839
processes at a grassroots level and so

1143
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:05,750
when the executive said we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

1144
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:09,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">something there was actually something</font>

1145
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:12,260
there to do and so whether you'll get

1146
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:13,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question of what do you start with I</font>

1147
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you should start with drought</font>

1148
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,740
modeling I think everyone should start

1149
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:20,598
with drought modeling um you can you can

1150
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,430
get results fairly quickly with a

1151
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:25,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">whiteboard diagram and stride per</font>

1152
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:27,859
element in finding problems that doesn't

1153
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,869
necessarily give you impetus to fix them

1154
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:33,650
another technique<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might work for</font>

1155
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:36,020
getting started would be fuzzing you

1156
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,940
know we we all like to laugh at<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuzzy's</font>

1157
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,759
but the truth is fuzzer find things

1158
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,799
which are clearly bugs and if you fuzz

1159
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,529
something and it falls<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you fuzz</font>

1160
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:48,500
it more and it falls down more that may

1161
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:49,060
be a very actionable thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

1162
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,610
you know you can

1163
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:54,250
demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with 10 hours of fuzzing work</font>

1164
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:57,550
i found these<font color="#E5E5E5"> four bugs let's go get</font>

1165
00:51:54,250 --> 00:52:00,850
them fixed and then you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1166
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:02,980
we've gone through that process we fix

1167
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:04,750
those bugs then we fuzz it some more and

1168
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,370
we found some more bugs maybe we need to

1169
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,660
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about this what your</font>

1170
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:09,310
developers do differently during

1171
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,799
development so that we don't have as

1172
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:13,600
many bugs that fuzzing can find how do

1173
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,280
we take that lesson of fuzzing and

1174
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,589
expand it to our whole testing

1175
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,290
organization right and this is where

1176
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:23,230
it's very dependent on your org to be

1177
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:25,630
able to say where will<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get traction</font>

1178
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:28,900
and where will you be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to find</font>

1179
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:31,810
successes so that at some point when you

1180
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:34,140
want to say we should devote n % of our

1181
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:36,640
development activities to security and

1182
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:39,370
someone says well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will we get out</font>

1183
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it you have an answer that isn't just</font>

1184
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:43,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is what Microsoft gets but it's</font>

1185
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:47,040
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would get just does that answer</font>

1186
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:50,040
your question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions</font>

1187
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,040
yes

1188
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:10,930
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of proof</font>

1189
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:18,069
points and audit points do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have for</font>

1190
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:20,450
audit and sox 404 so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have um</font>

1191
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:24,940
we have so the security development

1192
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:28,759
lifecycle is really three things it's

1193
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:32,690
education<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's tools and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's process</font>

1194
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,960
management and within the tooling we

1195
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:39,559
have a tool that everyone who's involved

1196
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:41,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl registers their project and</font>

1197
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:44,029
does things like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example they will</font>

1198
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:46,099
upload their threat modeling files where

1199
00:53:44,029 --> 00:53:47,740
we have automatic analysis techniques to

1200
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure they meet a minimum baseline</font>

1201
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:53,000
we have them upload<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results of all</font>

1202
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:56,569
sorts of tools we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people whose job</font>

1203
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,539
it is to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the teams who are</font>

1204
00:53:56,569 --> 00:54:08,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually doing these things and document</font>

1205
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:09,799
and report on what's being done um so so

1206
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:11,329
there's the automated tools and then

1207
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:13,670
there's the human beings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

1208
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:16,490
some of them intersect for example one

1209
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:20,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the design stage requirements is that</font>

1210
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:22,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">you provide us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a query that works</font>

1211
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:25,750
against products to do to report all of

1212
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:28,789
your security<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs so later on a</font>

1213
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:31,460
security analyst<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go run that query</font>

1214
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:33,230
look at all your security bugs look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1215
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:34,910
the ones that haven't been closed yet

1216
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:37,160
and get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or look at the ones that</font>

1217
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:40,819
are marked won't fix and say why was

1218
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:43,640
this marked won't fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh because it's an</font>

1219
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:46,549
admin attack it's an attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> that only</font>

1220
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,078
admin can execute on well if only<font color="#CCCCCC"> admin</font>

1221
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:50,089
can execute on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it maybe it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1222
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting attack we found yet we</font>

1223
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:53,900
triage to correctly or maybe there's an

1224
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:57,549
attack that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was triage incorrectly but</font>

1225
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,549
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in place could you that</font>

1226
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:33,609
isn't how do we stop people from

1227
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:38,470
cheating right so so how does a smaller

1228
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:39,910
organization do this and I think again

1229
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:41,950
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be someone organization</font>

1230
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:46,089
dependent but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that things like</font>

1231
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:48,549
arm training tracking who goes through

1232
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:50,230
what training right has everyone been

1233
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:52,300
you know we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of online</font>

1234
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:55,079
training when you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the online</font>

1235
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:57,970
training or if you come to blue hash um

1236
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,430
you get training credit for that and

1237
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:02,140
it's easy for a manager to see what the

1238
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:04,149
status of their group is with regard to

1239
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,848
training so I think that's one thing

1240
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:10,119
that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to duplicate another</font>

1241
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:12,520
is look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your bugs right if you find</font>

1242
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:17,020
a security bug the policy is you file it

1243
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:19,509
like this with these fields um how

1244
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">in-depth you need to be is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1245
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">very industry dependent you know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1246
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:27,309
want to say anything about HIPAA or

1247
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:30,400
socks or I think we might agree on that

1248
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:33,700
opinion of socks but it's it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1249
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,099
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> dependent on what evidence do your</font>

1250
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,348
auditors expect what can you give them

1251
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:40,780
that will satisfy them and I would be

1252
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:44,079
very upfront about saying look we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1253
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:47,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do this we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1254
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">budget you know auditors will always</font>

1255
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:52,089
always always ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for more because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1256
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,950
covering themselves and so you just you

1257
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:56,200
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what is the value of this</font>

1258
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:59,049
thing you're asking me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do how much</font>

1259
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:02,460
does it cost to do that do we get that

1260
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:02,460
value back and assurance

1261
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,640
yes

1262
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:20,800
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you expand on the</font>

1263
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:20,800
question a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1264
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:44,829
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure that developers who may</font>

1265
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:48,970
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as much knowledge as they</font>

1266
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:52,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">should get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it right there's there's two</font>

1267
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:55,390
answers the first is a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1268
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:58,119
training tries to sensitize people to

1269
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:01,569
where the areas whether they might make

1270
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:06,849
mistakes are so for example there's a

1271
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:10,960
slide that I have in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to</font>

1272
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:14,589
mitigate the problems and in there what

1273
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:17,019
it says is right invent new mitigations

1274
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:19,509
this is riskier there's a whole nother

1275
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:22,779
set of slides about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's risky and</font>

1276
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:25,960
how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there's a whole set</font>

1277
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:28,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people larger teams have security</font>

1278
