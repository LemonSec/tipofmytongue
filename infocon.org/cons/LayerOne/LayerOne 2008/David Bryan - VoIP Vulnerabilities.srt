1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:10,170
okay next up we have David Bryan talking

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,610
about reducing the risks to void after

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,559
which we're going to be taking a

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:22,680
intermission for lunch that'll rental

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">too all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right all right thank you i'm</font>

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:32,340
david bryan and probably will grab this

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,839
microphone so essentially i'm going to

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,620
be talking about reducing the risk to

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,370
your VoIP deployment kind of talk about

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a quick intro of myself what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,610
some of the technologies that are out

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,300
there in the environments that are

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,730
either open source or proprietary a

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,610
business case for why to do VoIP<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,898
it is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing some of the tools</font>

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,100
that are out there to break the VoIP

17
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,899
connections voice over IP and now let me

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,300
clarify when I say VoIP i'm not saying

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vantage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying a network protocol</font>

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,289
that lives on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your corporate network for</font>

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,140
doing voiceover that corporate IP

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,049
network some of the threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,750
that come with those tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the risks</font>

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they pose to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment we'll</font>

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,290
do a quick demo and we'll talk about

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,539
countermeasures in ways that you can

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,939
actually reduce that risk to an

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,520
acceptable level so and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

29
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:31,470
conclusion as to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the VoIP</font>

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,788
technologies that are out there

43
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:13,069
you've got sip you've got which is

44
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:15,260
session initiation protocol it's a very

45
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:17,238
common<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard it either goes over TCP</font>

46
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,739
or UDP depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

47
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:25,040
the setup it doesn't well I'm not going

48
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get into it but there's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interest</font>

51
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,609
protocol that's meant to sort of be a

52
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better at traversing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT</font>

53
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,989
networks there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nortel's which is a</font>

55
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:48,290
stimulus it's a proprietary protocol

56
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:52,480
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar in my opinion to</font>

57
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,480
the way that sip has has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

58
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,619
but I mean so it uses two different

59
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,720
channels for call setup and and the data

60
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,510
itself and then there's of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:06,220
cisco protocols the mgcp media gateway

62
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,840
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> protocol and the skinny sccp</font>

63
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,090
clients that cisco has come out with and

64
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:17,480
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3.com has their own proprietary one</font>

65
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:19,010
as well so one of the things that sort

66
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the business case behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing voice</font>

67
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,910
over IP is that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can share the</font>

68
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,078
infrastructure share your resources I

69
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,168
mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great thing now it</font>

70
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:32,000
reduces your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and deployment right</font>

71
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:34,579
all right for example a small 25-person

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,680
phone system can be deployed in about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6</font>

73
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:38,120
to 12 k that's just for the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

74
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,190
there's some labor that's involved with

75
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as well but on the other side</font>

76
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,290
there's actually the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3com system</font>

77
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've known a deployment where it's about</font>

78
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,150
30 grand and that includes the labor to

79
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,190
do a 25-person office that's kind of

80
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,220
expensive as compared to these other you

81
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,209
know open source type solutions another

82
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,849
benefit of some of the voice

83
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:02,450
technologies like sip as you can do

84
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:04,369
trucks across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the land the man and that</font>

85
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,679
allows you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do some of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least cost</font>

86
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,989
routing across network links that you're

87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,060
already paying for so you know in a

88
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,669
previous world you had to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PRI or</font>

89
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,169
you had to buy a ds3 and then that was

90
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:17,600
strictly dedicated for your voice

91
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:19,400
channels in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your voice traffic well now</font>

92
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,910
you can route that same voice network

00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,529
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

94

you're already paying for between<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

96
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:31,849
enterprise environments so Jesus offers

additional features such as softphones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

98
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,630
mean you know in some cases might be

99
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,770
nice for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a traveling salesman to be able</font>

100
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,480
to call back into the head office

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device easily the management becomes</font>

113
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,450
much easier whereas in the old days you

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,460
have a PBX and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your key system you'd go</font>

to the management phone and you'd sit

down and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> typing digits and you</font>

through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party it stills really</font>

135
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,580
this is primarily focused on some of the

asterisk type deployments<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

all the way Praia Terry protocols that I

155
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,290
mentioned because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing any</font>

159
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,770

the call setup or within the actual

162
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:11,250
two areas in the protocols that have

163
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:12,840
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very distinctly separate where</font>

164
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,400
you have you know the call setup

165
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,919
essentially says I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make this</font>

00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:55,260
so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it kind of you can kind</font>

180
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,919

and the phone will hang up it's like

204
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,980
wait a minute or you can tell it hey

205
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,900
dial this other party for me and you're

206
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,150
you're a third party without having to

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs they're using for some of the</font>

219
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,560
voice channels like CDP for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

cisco switch CDP is cisco discovery

protocol will tell hey the voice VLAN

222
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,490
lives on this so now if you plug into a

223
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,650
cisco switch you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can tell what voice</font>

224
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,630
VLAN it's on and then start injecting

225
00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,189
traffic onto that or basically

226
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:04,450
participate in that voice VLAN sip sac

227
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:06,100
is a Swiss Army knife of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIP so I can go</font>

228
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,720
in and forge whatever type of packet

229
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,970
header I want and send it along to the

230
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,700
phone and the phone doesn't generally

231
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,710
care because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's UDP there's no</font>

232
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:21,339
connection entries there's no state

233
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:23,290
there's no in<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sip</font>

234
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:26,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">p which is actually it's meant to be a</font>

235
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:29,079
tester<font color="#E5E5E5"> of voice servers to see how many</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">simultaneous calls or call channels it</font>

237
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,250
can do call setups that can do but it

238
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,540
works really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well for attacking phones</font>

239
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:40,120
because it just sends a lot of traffic

240
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:43,829
RTP inject will inject on that real time

241
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:48,570
protocol the voice stream essentially

242
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,430
come along and well we'll see come along

243
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:55,100
and just insert whatever data you want

244
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that stream so so some of the risks</font>

245
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,290
phone calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting dropped telephone</font>

246
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:04,620
booths getting knocked over just kidding

247
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,469
endpoints being attacked rebooted bogus

248
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,350
voice data forged or intercepted calls

249
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:13,110
and then loss of confidentiality and I

250
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,390
think the forged or intercepted calls

251
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,950
would in my opinion be even more

252
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,780
disturbing than the loss of

253
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,640
confidentiality I mean loss of

254
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,829
confidentiality anybody can go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

255
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,380
dry pair and plug in at your you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> d</font>

256
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:28,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">mark or wherever but the integrity if</font>

257
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:31,260
you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject media onto that</font>

258
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,850
that media path you now could start you

259
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,300
know essentially doing some sort of

260
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,440
corporate espionage on another company

261
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,880
and you have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font>

262
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,890
perspective rather than this perspective

263
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,730
of oh yeah well they'll never figure out

264
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:48,170
that someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else injected on that all</font>

265
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">right yeah so some of the main reasons</font>

266
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,000
lack of secure transport methods now I

267
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,060
say that but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually 2003</font>

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,330
there's rfcs that came out for sip ass

269
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,119
and srtp so it's there it's on the books

270
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:05,520
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not implemented in anything by</font>

271
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,770
anything i say asterisk asterisk it's

272
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,390
like oh go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement this you you</font>

273
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,090
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> download this package and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

274
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,939
do this well why isn't this built into

275
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,920
the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean essentially we want</font>

276
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,540
to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> against these attacks it</font>

277
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,219
should be built<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the software so we</font>

278
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,689
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> test it and deploy it in a</font>

279
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,480
production environment without having to

280
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,830
worry about things breaking you know

281
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to play with it on your</font>

282
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,310
own but when you're actually going into

283
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">a production deployment this this</font>

284
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,209
technology and tools should be built

285
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the software rather than as a</font>

286
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party ad on yeah lack of good</font>

287
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication methods there's no</font>

288
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,890
cryptographic hashing that happens when

289
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,860
you authenticate to a sip server or to a

290
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">voice over IP type server it's just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi</font>

291
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,780
here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and oh here's my md5</font>

292
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,980
signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great how do you</font>

293
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,720
know that it's me that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

294
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,400
actually talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> or how do I know</font>

295
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the Gateway is who I'm actually</font>

296
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,829
talking to

297
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,279
you don't now that the way to fix that

298
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:04,959
for the call setup is TLS transport

299
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,910
layer security which you have

300
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,209
certificates that you now know that the

301
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,529
server is who they're supposed to be and

302
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:14,170
then you know that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of brings back</font>

303
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:16,600
to the lack of non-repudiation yeah not

304
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,550
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to know who the client is or</font>

305
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,019
the server is supposed to be or who they

306
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,160
say they are all right so now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

307
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:29,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get through this so that you guys can</font>

308
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:50,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">have lunch we'll go into and do a quick</font>

309
00:13:29,319 --> 00:14:03,730
demo here inject all right so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font>

310
00:13:50,589 --> 00:14:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a call mortuary dick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> schaap all</font>

311
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,209
right how's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on doing good how</font>

312
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,910
is in stocks that you placed last night

313
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,069
they're doing very well except for this

314
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:19,689
one but I have advanced information

315
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:21,449
about that really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that i don't</font>

316
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:29,139
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i should say anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

317
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:32,500
it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like i'm on speakerphone in an</font>

318
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:35,279
emergency please proceed calmly to the

319
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,279
nearest exit

320
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:41,899
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just did was i injected on our</font>

321
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,119
phone conversation so we were having a

322
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:45,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation talking about whatever and</font>

323
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:47,809
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden that's telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

324
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:57,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the building wait a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font>

325
00:14:47,809 --> 00:15:00,978
so there's other things you can do an

326
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:10,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">emergency please proceed calmly to the</font>

327
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:11,660
nearest well in that cost there's a

328
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,339
couple other voice samples that i put

329
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,589
together that maybe be just better to

330
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,660
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one of them would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be you</font>

331
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:22,100
know essentially a hey there's a hot tip

332
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:24,949
on this stock or somebody hearing you

333
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,019
know from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ceo's type voice oh my God</font>

334
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:30,228
we're going under I mean this could be a

335
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,489
laugh black<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lassa a loss of sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

336
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:34,399
know confidentiality or not

337
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:36,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">confidentiality but trust in the workers</font>

338
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean the workers if they hear this on</font>

339
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:41,929
their phones well what's true and what's

340
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,629
not so the RTP inject was actually tool

341
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:45,949
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was demoed at black hat last year so</font>

342
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:48,769
I didn't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with any of this stuff</font>

343
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:50,868
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the one thinking about</font>

344
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:56,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what can I do with this this is bad</font>

345
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:59,600
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

346
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:03,799
we'll do is we'll actually do I have it

347
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,839
here so I've got this polycom phone

348
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,959
sitting down here and actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

349
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:19,159
turn the ringer up on that it's at the

350
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:20,459
bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what's it doing what</font>

351
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:27,390
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it say</font>

352
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:30,240
oh it stopped ringing wait a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font>

353
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:36,900
what's going on here do what are the

354
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:39,590
lights on it doing nothing oh it's

355
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,240
locked up I just locked up the phone

356
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,980
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I mean again</font>

357
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,350
you know that the lack of availability

358
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,420
of the network will make it so that the

359
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,460
users don't trust the system if the

360
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,069
users don't trust and understand the

361
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:57,810
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's good you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have a</font>

362
00:16:53,070 --> 00:17:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">good voice deployment all right oh and</font>

363
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:04,849
the last thing one final<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing come on</font>

364
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,719
yeah calls

365
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,549
alright<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work before here we go</font>

366
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,880
they're doing very well except for this

367
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:43,980
one but I have advanced information

368
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,710
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if I should say</font>

369
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:53,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything about that it sounds like I'm</font>

370
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:55,110
on speakerphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> so essentially i</font>

371
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,470
recorded the voice traffic while we're

372
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,479
doing that same demo and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

373
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,460
leads back to the fact that this miss

374
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,830
media is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not encrypted this is actually</font>

375
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,710
an automated tool called voi ong that

376
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,168
goes through and pulls the the RTP off

377
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,840
the network pulls it into a file and

378
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,520
converts it to a wave automatically and

379
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,500
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also have call logs over here as</font>

380
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,610
to what was called and who called what

381
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,799
and everything again an automated tool

382
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:26,219
now this automated tool has to sit in

383
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,760
between the the actual endpoint and the

384
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,500
server or whatnot but there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

385
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,480
injection tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will do our pre</font>

386
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,480
directs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i become the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> default gateway</font>

387
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:42,830
alright so now let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some of</font>

388
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,540
countermeasures you could get a dog with

389
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,100
a shark fin and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> grim reaper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit</font>

390
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:59,820
at the front door your network and say

391
00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:02,750
out some of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do our</font>

392
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">VLANs does anybody know what a VLAN is</font>

393
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right virtual local area networks</font>

394
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:16,490
802 dot1q their logical separations now

395
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:18,750
this in itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an okay countermeasure</font>

396
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,720
but then you also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do router</font>

397
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,130
access control lists so you have a

398
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,770
basically a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 that it brings it up</font>

399
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,919
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from that that restricts who can</font>

400
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,690
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto that network ideally the the</font>

401
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,950
restriction would be just to what's

402
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,940
necessary in that Network I guess kind

403
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,100
of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons i'm doing this</font>

404
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,860
talk is is I was working with the client

405
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,600
that

406
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:48,110
was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure this out and you</font>

407
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,850
know it for them it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sort of a it's</font>

408
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,399
not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they think about in a</font>

409
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">day-to-day you know consequences of what</font>

410
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,309
could happen if stuff gets attacked

411
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,440
because it's their internal network

412
00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:00,200
who's going to attack but as an outside

413
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,760
party I go well you can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

414
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,840
got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to separate that traffic</font>

415
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you gotta be able to control and</font>

416
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:09,230
restrict its nobody can get access to it

417
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:11,689
you also need quality of service you

418
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:15,370
know if the users out there start to

419
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,440
hear you know either that that sounding

420
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,850
klaxon or they don't hear the traffic

421
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be hearing because of</font>

422
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,370
other network traffic again they'll

423
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,380
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lose faith in your network and</font>

424
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:29,449
then another really good control that

425
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,990
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually I got asked so neck</font>

426
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:35,600
isn't that dead yet I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

427
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,820
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing to go</font>

428
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,469
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually start to push for</font>

429
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,178
these voice over IP deployments because

431
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,270
to your entire voice land if they have

<font color="#E5E5E5">access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your voice land they have</font>

433
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,450
access to the data calls they have

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,929
access to the data calls they can do

435
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,580
whatever they want so network access

436
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:54,380
control will allow you to kind of say

437
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,510
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right only these endpoints are</font>

438
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,309
authenticated now maybe the certificate

439
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,799
lives on the phone if it's a certificate

440
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,149
based authentication and there's no

441
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,030
password on it so it's a little bit

442
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to steal it but it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot harder</font>

00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">for someone who's has no knowledge of</font>

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,539
the network to come in and just plug in

445
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,530
and then again integrating the stuff

450
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,929
there probably because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin been</font>

451
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,330
able to test it well enough and a lot of

452
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:33,980
the phones are really low powered stupid

453
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,649
they can't do a lot of encryption on

454
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,919
them although the polycom comes with

455
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:43,070
that built in so that there's also

458
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,320
this whole sip realm they just work on

459
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,240
the media path so they exchange keys

460
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,460
in the media itself which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:02,080
goofiness with that although you

465
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,940
probably do want to encrypt your your

466
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,559
setup your<font color="#CCCCCC"> concept which is where you</font>

get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIP TLS skype just kidding all</font>

468
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,220
the encryption is proprietary it's not

469
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,490
open source people haven't been able to

470
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,529
really good a good review of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

471
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,090
wouldn't say that skype is the answer to

472
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:21,429
a lot of this stuff yes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does do</font>

473
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:27,158
encryption but you know it's across many

474
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:28,779
parties so some topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I felt</font>

475
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,059
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to include would be</font>

476
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:33,580
a flat network you know this is

477
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:35,799
generally how small environments are

478
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,178
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a flat network or large</font>

479
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,830
enterprise environments that haven't

480
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,750
gotten the push to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to put in new</font>

up inject the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a routed</font>

487
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,710
network so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where I'm talking</font>

488
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:58,840
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing your architecture where</font>

489
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,720
you have the same physical hardware but

490
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,350
a VLAN that separates those two networks

491
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,929
from the users perspective they can only

492
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the office server and maybe to</font>

493
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:11,649
the stuff on the VoIP server and and

494
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:15,070
that might be you know maybe to check

495
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:17,979
their voicemail or to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at call logs</font>

496
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,590
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually set up a call</font>

497
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:24,879
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know again sort of goes</font>

498
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:26,860
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the media setup and then you</font>

499
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:29,559
have a router in between the routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

500
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:34,120
traffic with access control lists on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

501
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:36,039
router and then quality a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

502
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,059
know on the switch itself you want to

503
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:43,539
set up good quality service items so

504
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:47,428
that your UDP stream for your RTP calls

505
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:52,149
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets higher priority</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then your</font>

506
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:54,279
tcp/ip like email HTTP etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

507
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:56,529
with UDP you can drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few packets</font>

508
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,529
packets but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't have them arrive</font>

509
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:02,130
late so that's where some of this

510
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:04,930
quality of service comes into place

511
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,520
tcp they can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to order it</font>

512
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:10,120
doesn't care it will reassemble them or

513
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:14,020
react for more packets or whatever needs

514
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:18,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do so conclusion VoIP voice over IP</font>

515
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:20,170
little to no security it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC</font>

516
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,470
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology that</font>

517
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're using today great for reducing the</font>

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,420
cost of business<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I I actually to give</font>

trixbox solution at my office I've got

521
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:38,860
20 users on it it works great it was way

522
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:41,110
cheaper than any PBX type system and now

523
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,149
I can you know make calls from at home

524
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,719
and play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people's phones and all</font>

525
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,310
that stuff but it and actually the the

526
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,910
one tool the tool that rebooted the

527
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:54,280
polycom over here I did my talk two

528
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,290
weeks ago Thursday night and came in the

529
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">next morning and the other guys I was</font>

530
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,030
working with said hey there's this this

531
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,320
50 60 port open on these two scans that

532
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,120
we did last night and these are two

533
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,220
completely different clients David scans

534
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,889
for I'm like oh that's interesting well

535
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,740
go grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> sip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sack and start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throwing some</font>

536
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,710
headers at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one of the guys pulls</font>

537
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,300
up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIP p software and points it at</font>

538
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:20,790
his desk phone he's like hey look at

539
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:23,560
this reboots the phone I'm like oh no so

540
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,300
from that perspective it's it's

541
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,490
interesting to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's really</font>

542
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,520
not a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good security built into</font>

543
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:33,340
these devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so good for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

544
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,260
availability or integrity and it does

545
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,870
require i would say wholeheartedly

546
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,330
requires compensating controls so the

547
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,610
router<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles the vlans you know it</font>

548
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,379
requires a little bit more complexity in

549
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,629
your architecture but will help reduce

550
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:51,220
that risk and create availability and

551
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,660
integrity for your environment so all

552
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,050
right

553
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,060
so thanks to layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> one evil annoyed for</font>

554
00:25:55,050 --> 00:26:01,440
setting this up nets by for bringing me

555
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:11,780
out here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HBIC my wife head</font>

556
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:11,780
bitch in charge so all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

557
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:21,750
go have fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> at lunch oh yeah does</font>

558
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:25,889
anybody have any questions oh man I was

559
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:28,550
quick holy moly does anybody have any

560
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,550
questions seriously

561
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,190
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so the question is</font>

562
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,809
recommendations for early voice over IP

563
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:51,669
phones that have been brought in to

564
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:53,379
convert them to encryption right what

565
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:57,330
other things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do so if you can't</font>

566
00:26:53,380 --> 00:27:00,250
do encryption and are these cisco phones

567
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:02,789
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco okay if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do</font>

568
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:07,299
encryption again you know set up your

569
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:08,620
proper vlans maybe try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nak</font>

570
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:12,100
although if they're older phones they

571
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,600
probably don't do nak set them aside so

572
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,030
that nobody else can get to them from

573
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network essentially and make sure</font>

574
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're monitoring the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> port's that</font>

575
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're plugged into you know one of the</font>

576
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,350
other things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is what is it</font>

577
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,209
port security unlike a cisco where

578
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,158
essentially you lock that port to that

579
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac now I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying somebody can't</font>

580
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,600
come along and put a different mac on

581
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,350
there that's trivial but the idea was be

582
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:41,350
that the the lowest common person would

583
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,780
plug in with their you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know laptop and</font>

584
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:47,230
probably a trigger alarm essentially and

585
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:49,600
shut down that port so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say you</font>

586
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,370
know port controls vlans routed networks

587
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,189
if you can get it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data network</font>

588
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,020
that's the best part and still use the

589
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,190
same shared you know equipment that's

590
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,590
the hardest part<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

591
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,820
to go to management and go yeah we need

592
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another six thousand dollars</font>

593
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,370
worth of switches what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean well</font>

594
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:09,400
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you know all your voice calls</font>

595
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,168
are belong to me well they're probably

596
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to fly with that so you could</font>

597
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I said even if you if thats which</font>

598
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:18,668
doesn't have a router in it you could

599
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,320
maybe purchase a router or<font color="#E5E5E5"> purchase some</font>

600
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,090
sort of intermediary device that would

601
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,460
route between those networks maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

602
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,928
like a pfsense firewall you know some

603
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,270
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of open source firewall that allow</font>

604
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:30,630
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> control what has access to that</font>

605
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,629
VLAN

606
00:28:36,129 --> 00:28:46,968
that's on soft bones question has

607
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:50,359
thoughts on softphones<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus hardware</font>

608
00:28:46,969 --> 00:28:53,989
phones mixed environment i would say i

609
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,849
mean i would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do it just go</font>

610
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:56,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the hardware phone because the</font>

611
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:59,928
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the soft</font>

612
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:01,909
phone is my calls just dropped I don't

613
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:04,699
know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this phone sucks I</font>

614
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:07,279
don't want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it well what were you</font>

615
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:11,419
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was downloading porn wait a</font>

616
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,529
minute first of all you're not supposed

617
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:14,599
to be downloading<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on corporate</font>

618
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:16,099
laptops second of all that's eating up

619
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,019
your bandwidth and there's no quality

620
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:21,499
service from your home internet up to us

621
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:24,709
so I think the soft phones have a

622
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:27,049
purpose and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually what is it</font>

623
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:29,119
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft call gateway that the</font>

624
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:30,769
softphones connect to that and then from

625
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">there it's actually proxied into the SIP</font>

626
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,149
environment or into the voice over IP

627
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,529
environment so that reduces your risk

628
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,928
because now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say all right these</font>

629
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:42,499
Microsoft servers only have access to my

630
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:44,569
sip environment but you know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

631
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:49,089
in between the the soft foam path and

632
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:52,129
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft proxy I think what's that</font>

633
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:55,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">VPN yeah yeah you could do a VPN between</font>

634
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:57,049
that and that but that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font>

635
00:29:55,309 --> 00:30:00,229
compensating controls than somebody's

636
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:02,619
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend so there's a question</font>

637
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">back there</font>

638
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,510
no actually that's a really good

639
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,909
question so he said last time he played

640
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,910
with asterisk it was a pain<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the butt</font>

641
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I i agree i would absolutely agree</font>

642
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,980
that was about three or four years ago

643
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,660
so and then now he wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know when</font>

644
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,310
you do the asterisk<font color="#CCCCCC"> deployment how does</font>

645
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,290
that account for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your time and setting</font>

646
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:37,020
it up well there's actually something

647
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:39,360
called trixbox or asterisk at home or

648
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,740
asterisk now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know i think</font>

649
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's somebody who works for digium</font>

650
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:47,400
out here yeah yeah yeah exactly asterisk

651
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:51,180
at home became trixbox so with trixbox

652
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,440
it's a self deployed I so which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font>

653
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,420
of nice because everything comes

654
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,250
pre-installed but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again everything</font>

655
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,020
comes with defaults so you got to go

656
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">through and change some of that stuff</font>

657
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,879
for security but I can get a deployment

658
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,040
up and running actually I do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

659
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,370
my house I can get a deployment up and

660
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,050
running with trixbox in about an hour so

661
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,909
it reduces my time quite a bit because

662
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,100
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got good tools for managing like</font>

663
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,660
the endpoints managing accounts it's got

664
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,639
a web<font color="#E5E5E5"> front-end to be able to go in and</font>

665
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,470
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right add this extension at this</font>

666
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,190
thing at this thing I could show it to

667
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:25,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually on the screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here it's</font>

668
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:29,010
I've got it running<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a vm over here</font>

669
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:33,000
whoops so trixbox is actually running

670
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:36,860
right here so that's the console<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

671
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,860
away sorry

672
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:46,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">I hit the wrong button I did I hit the</font>

673
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:50,149
dt button I've got psi with pgp

674
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:56,690
encryption on it let me pull up a web

675
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:59,030
browser here so to answer your question

676
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so now I the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other things I did</font>

677
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,010
do is I I built a wiki for our users

678
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,470
because I got a lot of questions how do

679
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,090
I get into my conference bridge Christ I

680
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,030
wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down i sent it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you an email</font>

681
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:15,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right fine but well so the central</font>

682
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:18,830
Central documentation and how that that

683
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:21,590
works is critical for user acceptance if

684
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,090
if they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place to go to look</font>

685
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,770
it up or somewhere that they have a

686
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,159
cheat sheet for it they're not gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

687
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,160
able to do it

688
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">vass wrd actually i think the default is</font>

689
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:49,580
PA SS w0 rd<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something so this is</font>

690
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is freepbx which is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

691
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,149
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a separate thing in itself</font>

692
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,610
that you could install<font color="#CCCCCC"> on any asterisk</font>

693
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,370
system and allows you to have you know

694
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,959
extensions and here's how you add users

695
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:03,919
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system essentially which is kind</font>

696
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,690
of nice you got trunks I mean there's

697
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,730
always stuff that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

698
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,250
the one thing that I think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

699
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,110
nice is this endpoint manager so when I

700
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,160
wanted to go set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone I just</font>

701
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,290
said all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here's the mac address</font>

702
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes and looks up the extensions</font>

703
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,129
in asterisk in the my sequel database

704
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,470
and goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right here you go boom</font>

705
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:26,140
submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> writes it to the tftp folder i</font>

706
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:34,910
boot the phone away you go so all right

707
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:37,910
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions yeah so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

708
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:39,560
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs as a security</font>

709
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:43,640
measure how would I mitigate VLAN

710
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:45,440
hopping so the best way to mitigate VLAN

711
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,240
hopping is to get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that daisy</font>

712
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,190
chain port that's on the back and just

713
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,480
say sorry you can't use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

714
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,760
what's what you're going to have to do

715
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,020
in order to have that port on the back

716
00:33:52,760 --> 00:34:00,680
be useful is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch will have to be</font>

717
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:07,010
able to essentially have multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans</font>

718
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:09,290
come at it so or yeah essentially if you

719
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:11,449
can limit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the port to just the VLAN for</font>

720
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,800
the voice traffic only and lock down to

721
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,589
the mac address or do network access

722
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:19,100
control you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then start to only allow</font>

723
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,230
traffic from that VLAN for that port as

724
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,299
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start to allow anything to</font>

725
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:26,120
come in on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> port</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can start taking</font>

726
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:28,670
my hat my packets with that 802 dot1q

727
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,710
header that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the VLAN that's the voice</font>

728
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,900
network so and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font>

729
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,820
become part of that Network although it

730
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,350
is really nice from the perspective that

731
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,850
you know the end user could plug

732
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,219
whatever device into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

733
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,620
phone it's sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security risk</font>

734
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:44,989
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone now has to do the</font>

735
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:47,839
filter or no does the filtering for the

736
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:49,668
user it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually something you set up</font>

737
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the switch so that if the packet</font>

738
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:55,190
tagged like with the voice VLAN it then

739
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:58,579
gets dumped into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal network</font>

740
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:01,040
feel an so again the best thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

741
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:03,440
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it so that port only goes to</font>

742
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,259
that VLAN and then put some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> nak</font>

743
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,450
on it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can or port access control</font>

744
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:12,410
filtering so sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be a</font>

745
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:14,618
more of a pain but<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright saw someone</font>

746
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,618
over here

747
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:33,710
sure so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is new to voice</font>

748
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,070
over IP just wants to know how you could

749
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:39,200
get some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software to play with it</font>

750
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:41,680
the easiest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is probably to just</font>

751
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,319
download the vmware image of tricks box

752
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,560
or I think asterisk now also has a

753
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,630
vmware image I say trixbox because the

754
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,690
management's pretty easy the stuffs all

755
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:56,780
there you got to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

756
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,770
with the asterisk<font color="#CCCCCC"> now set up it's not as</font>

757
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:02,930
user friendly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say you just</font>

758
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,609
download it set it up you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to it I</font>

759
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,649
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like this this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a vmware</font>

760
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:09,020
image right here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on my</font>

761
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,880
laptop and I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know setting up</font>

762
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,890
phones and there's soft phones you can

763
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:26,720
connect up and all that fun stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

764
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:31,750
start playing with it any enhancement to

765
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,750
the provisioning process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

766
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,970
like to reduce the risk when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

767
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone up essentially</font>

768
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:42,319
there's many you can do that's the

769
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,690
that's the hardest part<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can tell</font>

770
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:45,920
it to use ftp versus tftp that might be

771
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,329
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a security feature</font>

772
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:53,920
because now you have to authenticate to

773
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:56,630
the device Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> ftps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right so I</font>

774
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,390
accept is that like 301 firmware or

775
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:02,540
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so you could</font>

776
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:05,420
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup a ftp s server it</font>

777
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,849
might be easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an SCP but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

778
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:11,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">ftps isn't that TLS with ftp you wrapped</font>

779
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">around it yeah so it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little</font>

780
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,899
bit harder to deploy an environment

781
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,400
unless you have the FTPS server but if

782
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,240
you can do it that would be a way to

783
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:25,300
mitigate some of that the risk of of

784
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:32,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting set up yeah yeah</font>

785
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:35,380
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you got to generate certificates</font>

786
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:39,419
though I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kidding no I know I know</font>

787
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if you're not doing self-signed I</font>

788
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,940
know but you never mind you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

789
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,700
a certificate authority<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up so most</font>

790
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:55,450
people don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a CA set up or if they</font>

791
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:58,029
well yeah exactly but then you got to

792
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,529
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that CA remember there's got to</font>

793
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:02,050
be policies and procedures in a ways to

794
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure someone doesn't have a brute</font>

795
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:07,600
CA certificate without a pass phrase or

796
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,549
you know that kind of thing so I think

797
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a it's a way to do it but again</font>

798
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,680
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to involve some more</font>

799
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,680
complexity with it Oh

800
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,750
so question is what about the

801
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:42,479
off-the-shelf type systems do they have

802
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:44,700
any security built into them off the top

803
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">my head no I haven't done a lot of</font>

804
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,189
research per se myself to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it</font>

805
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one system that I did work actually</font>

806
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,430
the two systems that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with</font>

807
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three common the nortel they don't</font>

808
00:38:53,430 --> 00:39:00,419
have any security into the audio channel

809
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:02,040
or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> call setup and it's you know</font>

810
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">again it's not something that they think</font>

811
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">about actually it's not that they don't</font>

812
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that clients aren't</font>

813
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:10,650
demanding that that's built in so as

814
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:12,450
soon as clients start to say hey this

815
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">has got to be in here before we'll buy</font>

816
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:18,359
it then they'll start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually do</font>

817
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that although with the nortel solution I</font>

818
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,770
think in one of their next revisions

819
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,540
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about potentially</font>

820
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:27,450
building some of the voice channel

821
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,950
encryption in but you know as beta and

822
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:34,910
they said oh we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to try</font>

823
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:34,910
this it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work okay well anyway</font>

824
00:39:47,230 --> 00:40:00,310
oh that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so something that</font>

825
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,300
you mentioned over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is is there's</font>

826
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:06,009
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> what tool is it veneer that's a</font>

827
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,619
knack product that will sit in between

828
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:12,070
or or monitor that that traffic coming

829
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:13,990
off that endpoint and profile it or

830
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,970
heuristic it'll it'll look to see if

831
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,609
it's a VoIP session or not if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

832
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:21,520
VoIP session it'll actually kill the

833
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:23,290
port so that's pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that</font>

834
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,180
takes to the management<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reduces your</font>

835
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:36,820
management constraints quite a bit so

836
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:39,660
makes your deployment a lot easier well

837
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:43,600
I think if there's no further questions

838
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,750
Thank go ahead and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some lunch thank</font>

839
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,750
you
