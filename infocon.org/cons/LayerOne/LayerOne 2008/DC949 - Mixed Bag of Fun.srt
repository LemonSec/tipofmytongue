1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,780
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks it's the last talk of the day</font>

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,060
figured we'd do something a little

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,130
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than having one</font>

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,299
presenter talk for an hour we've got

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,419
three presenters that are each going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,300
do about 20 minutes we've got virus

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,550
Merlin and CP they've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,210
some interesting interesting stuff with

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,440
Wi-Fi and Firefox because it was you

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys are gonna put on the Wi-Fi thing</font>

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,949
right oh you're not going to be the

12
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:47,129
Wi-Fi thing after all ok so just Firefox

13
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:48,180
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well before ramble on any</font>

14
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:57,870
further all the way to just go ahead and

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:01:02,550
let you guys talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so I'm CP</font>

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:06,000
from DC 949 and this is our mixed bag of

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,270
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right so i'll be presenting</font>

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,729
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking with firefox i'll be giving</font>

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,780
some specific examples of things that I

20
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:20,810
have done using Firefox and how it might

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,810
benefit you guys so let's get started

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to look at practical hacking</font>

23
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,719
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox and I know most of you</font>

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,880
probably use firefox probably use it for

25
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,880
just checking your email and watching

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,539
porn the various<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,280
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do but when it</font>

28
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,740
comes right down to it there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,740
possibilities aren't open to most of us

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it comes to Firefox there are a few</font>

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,390
extensions out there like tamper data

32
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,740
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hack bar and if you sell us talk</font>

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,780
yesterday there was one of us sequel

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,689
injection and stuff like that pretty

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,810
good pretty good stuff but I'm hoping to

36
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,669
open this all to any one who can develop

37
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,429
or even can't develop it wants to learn

38
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:10,280
now because it's very easy so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacking</font>

39
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:12,569
Firefox yes firefox very you know

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,460
relatively easier to maintain when

41
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,810
you're developing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox and if</font>

42
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,010
you're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> an application from the</font>

43
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,710
ground up the the development<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,689
lot lower when it comes to because

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:30,060
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already building off of a</font>

46
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:32,019
structured application like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox and</font>

47
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,480
you have access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the unique</font>

48
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:37,239
systems that are already inherent to

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,358
Firefox like Ajax systems session

50
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,939
handling or rather cookie handling and

51
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:45,099
you can run javascript and flash and all

52
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:48,969
the various assortments of server-side

53
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:53,589
or rather client-side code that can be

54
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:55,620
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your advantage k 2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X cookies in</font>

55
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,970
the flesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry about</font>

56
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,739
operating system differences because in

57
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,049
a position that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> run Firefox will</font>

58
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,669
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Firefox extension so if you code</font>

59
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:08,049
it properly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have any issues</font>

60
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:10,120
yeah we all use them few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us build</font>

61
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,919
them I don't know why<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're</font>

62
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,209
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy to make all you</font>

63
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,609
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know is some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Java strip</font>

64
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:19,260
and I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure most of us can run</font>

65
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:22,269
Java scripts pretty sure there's also a

66
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">XUL which is the XML user interface</font>

67
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,680
language which is developed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla</font>

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,449
it's very easy to learn and you could

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,459
probably learn it in the weekend it's

70
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:32,530
basically the front end which gives

71
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,870
interaction to whatever you write with

72
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,409
the back end in<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript there's a lot</font>

73
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">of potential here lot of untapped</font>

74
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,668
untapped uses I feel like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us in</font>

75
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,679
fact most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us in the industry like to</font>

76
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:47,139
think is a Firefox with a browser that

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">has the ability to build tools upon but</font>

78
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,650
I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a little bit more</font>

79
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:54,099
uniquely like it's a a<font color="#E5E5E5"> toolbox that has</font>

80
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,540
a browser so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can expand beyond</font>

81
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:57,939
that it could do all of us a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of good</font>

82
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,879
for web<font color="#CCCCCC"> web application security and</font>

83
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:03,280
auditing gives you the control over the

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">input/output access of your hard disk as</font>

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,409
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything on the web like say a</font>

86
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">forum and if you learned yesterday from</font>

87
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,728
the other Firefox talk you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> automate</font>

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:19,570
sequel injection and cross-site

89
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:21,870
scripting auditing so beyond that i'm

90
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:26,800
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be giving some examples some</font>

91
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,330
specific security related auditing /

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,349
kind of interesting tools that i have

93
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,330
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last couple of years</font>

94
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:37,650
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them being toast which is a</font>

95
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:41,280
anti scraping scraper it helps help

96
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:43,799
scrape pages that are scraped resistance

97
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,900
and happy dance which if anyone was at

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:52,259
Def Con last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> will remember as the a</font>

99
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,698
CTF pwnage which yeah not not to make

100
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,909
people were happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that but I'll go</font>

101
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">over that as a form of malware so toast</font>

102
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:01,830
is what I like to refer to as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a post</font>

103
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:04,979
rendered<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dom scraper meaning that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

104
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,289
are certain websites that don't want you

105
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,419
to scrape them obviously you know theft

106
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:11,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">of usage and users ad revenue whatever</font>

107
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,740
the reason so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implement forms of</font>

108
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:16,740
javascript and flash in any kind of

109
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,330
client-side code that will ambush any

110
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,159
bot that's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scrape</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the source</font>

111
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,590
making it very difficult to get the

112
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">plane tix source out of it and what</font>

113
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,520
occurred to me is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox already</font>

114
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,409
does it it already handles javascript

115
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,878
and flash in any client side code and

116
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,219
all of the source code that you're

117
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,469
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for exists in the Dom after all</font>

118
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:37,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that runs pretty much the bypasses</font>

119
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:41,819
every every instance of a client-side

120
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,400
anti scraping techniques so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think yes</font>

121
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it stands for by the way the</font>

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,638
overactive scraping technique I do have

123
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:54,000
a demo no i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't sorry strong yeah</font>

124
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,339
sorry strong but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do have a demo I do</font>

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a demo which my slide wouldn't like</font>

126
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:05,900
to tell you that it is well prepared

127
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:09,990
strong so I'm hoping it'll work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

128
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:13,370
no party policy yes as of this morning

129
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,370
this is the new policy at the front desk

130
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:19,099
no no so if everyone see this page it

131
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,119
may look<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar to you it is the</font>

132
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,250
hacker manifesto it's pretty interesting

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,620
how this is gets gets gets created if

134
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,970
you if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source here all</font>

135
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,890
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see is you know some</font>

136
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,660
style information and an iframe and if

137
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,030
you go to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page you'll get that</font>

138
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,380
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and whatever iframe you go</font>

139
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,169
to will continue to show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

140
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,530
frame through a series of session

141
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,270
handling and passes off the get

142
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,270
parameter and basically through various

143
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,729
levels of anti<font color="#E5E5E5"> scripting techniques is</font>

144
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,780
my kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proof of concept for this it</font>

145
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:56,420
also uses a flash file to take gibberish

146
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,489
code and decrypt it into the hacker

147
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:03,260
manifesto here I know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font>

148
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,060
that's great yeah there's all the

149
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,289
iframes anyway it does a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

150
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes right down to</font>

151
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,400
it it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so a browser can see</font>

152
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,659
it but all I bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see is this and</font>

153
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,859
even if they try to go to that they're

154
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get that again and if they get</font>

155
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,640
through all that then there's still the

156
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,099
encrypted source so what I have here is

157
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little firefox extension written</font>

158
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,680
completely in<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript and XUL hmm</font>

159
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,800
right before that literally like 10

160
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,640
minutes ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to write basically</font>

161
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you</font>

162
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,190
how it works what you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

163
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">original content of the page they're all</font>

164
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,360
the encryptions and obfuscations and the

165
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,430
final content in a javascript alert

166
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,780
which basically signals the fact that

167
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,260
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had we've had succession in</font>

168
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,210
scraping the contents now we also have

169
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,370
later that without even opening the

170
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,739
window and no it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an HS call it</font>

171
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,440
actually is rendering a negative 1 by

172
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,210
negative 1 width and height the window

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,790
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't exist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technically but it</font>

174
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,159
does then pull the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dom after all the</font>

175
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:06,770
javascript and flash runs 2d office<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kate</font>

176
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:09,530
an unencrypted the the office keishon

177
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,680
methods and gives you the source code

178
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,940
that you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for oh by the way if</font>

179
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,340
you want has any questions or<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font>

180
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,700
just yelled amount now to help me kind

181
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of expand my time here</font>

182
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:34,950
so yes Israel the this thing will this

183
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,860
this literally is a browser window this

184
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a browser window if I control</font>

185
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,450
you in here now there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> context stuff</font>

186
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,830
so it's a limited browser because i've

187
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,080
told it to be so because I want it to be

188
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,400
invisible I've only increased the<font color="#E5E5E5"> width</font>

189
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and height</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the invisible window to</font>

190
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,829
show the process but it is all

191
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:57,240
JavaScript it does just load the window

192
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:59,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then once the content is loaded in d</font>

193
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,810
office created it does pull the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file of</font>

194
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:07,079
Dom out of the page so anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else for</font>

195
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:10,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to move back into</font>

196
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,340
my slides

197
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:23,220
alright so how about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> party last</font>

198
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,660
night ya know there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so the</font>

199
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:33,420
other example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have for you guys today</font>

200
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:35,339
is happy dance which was part of there

201
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,719
we go which is part of the amateur

202
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,840
capture the flag game last year at Def

203
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,310
Con I presented it as a login

204
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,370
authentication for one of the flags

205
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,979
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user would be provided at web</font>

206
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,390
page with a form to login but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

207
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,920
unable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it did not have this</font>

208
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,800
extension so then they were then linked

209
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,719
to add-ons that mozilla.org which we

210
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,930
were spoofing locally which downloaded

211
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,210
this extension and when they ran it it

212
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,400
would authenticate them as a log inable

213
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,640
user I know it's made of a word<font color="#E5E5E5"> butts</font>

214
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">bear with me as a user that's able to</font>

215
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">log in and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would they would escort</font>

216
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,670
very simple they could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in to</font>

217
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,780
score what they didn't realize was the

218
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that it was also be some malware</font>

219
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:23,339
which then used<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ajax calls to send in</font>

220
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,720
plain text all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stored passwords to</font>

221
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,580
the server which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is then displayed at</font>

222
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the game for fun and excuse</font>

223
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">me a a lot of users didn't realize this</font>

224
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,310
I was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of concerned about that</font>

225
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,990
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought I was a hacking</font>

226
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,390
convention that hackers are going to and

227
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,220
playing in a hacking game but apparently

228
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,340
people didn't realize that they were

229
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,050
going to be hacked I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that so</font>

230
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:53,760
I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to have given people too much</font>

231
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:55,650
too much trust in there yeah it's it's

232
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,180
it definitely goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

233
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though we're actors we're still</font>

234
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,349
susceptible to being hacked and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

235
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,949
times we just don't practice what we

236
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:07,890
preach anyway so yeah right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also I</font>

237
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:11,160
missed that point it also ran any code

238
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,210
on the client side in<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript so we</font>

239
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,810
were doing things like making their

240
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,770
browsers close and open indefinitely or

241
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,030
opening up pictures of goatse than

242
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,250
freezing the browser so they can get

243
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from it actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

244
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,680
means we had opened their browser to

245
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,960
meatspin.com which don't go there not

246
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,310
here at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yes there was one of</font>

247
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,960
the team members actually left it open

248
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,760
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I walked by them like that's</font>

249
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,390
supposed to disturb you she's like I

250
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:41,069
know but I really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this I</font>

251
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:42,510
walked away needless to say so I really

252
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,190
hope that a lot of people learned their

253
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,780
lesson last year and this year it's

254
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,200
going to be a lot worse so I hope they

255
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,910
come prepared Rick and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe risk</font>

256
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,090
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe me spin with three</font>

257
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,010
ghastly so yes they were gone you might

258
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,020
get everything you might get everything

259
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,890
get everything so yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some this</font>

260
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:04,470
dick rolled duck roll that's the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

is how as a hacking tool which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a</font>

284
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,149
short<font color="#CCCCCC"> little practical guide with a</font>

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> teeny bit of source code preface</font>

286
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,529
by a short extremely short history of

00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">artificial life and artificial</font>

288
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:47,439
intelligence development compared to

289
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:56,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and type of development we need</font>

290
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:59,889
to all right basically AI has been

291
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:01,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">around since the 50s or so they had a</font>

292
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,160
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of very hard problems thrown</font>

293
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,870
at them they tried a whole bunch of

294
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> methods they went in with lots</font>

295
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,910
of enthusiasm and they fell flat on

296
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:13,389
their face in the end they came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

297
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">some good solid design methods that can</font>

298
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:18,189
lead you to a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

299
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,319
really any problem and that basically is

300
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:22,329
working from the bottom up as you may or

301
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:24,699
may not know there's two basic design

302
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,729
principles top-down design and bottom-up

303
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:29,589
design top-down design basically is all

304
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,889
right we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a program that does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

305
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:36,220
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> various things so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

306
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:38,920
lay it out from<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi we're going to lay it</font>

307
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,470
out from the top which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logical</font>

308
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,120
program unit and then start building

309
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,800
down towards the bottom which is each

310
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,990
little piece of functionality that it

311
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,429
does the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things is the</font>

312
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,199
bottom-up development where you started

313
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:55,059
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> little component and you put those</font>

314
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,490
together to build one larger entity just

315
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,380
a short

316
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,290
little things many of you may or may not

317
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a lot of or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> original quote</font>

318
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,810
unquote hackers were all around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I labs</font>

319
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,760
they may not have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the aai lab</font>

320
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,779
but that's where the processors were so

321
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,779
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were hacking</font>

322
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:17,300
basically as hackers just like AI people

323
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,730
they came they came to these conclusions

324
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,250
based on trying to solve very hard to

325
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,810
define problems we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have very hard</font>

326
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,050
to define problems how do you keep

327
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,979
access from Joe random hacker but still

328
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,359
allow it for Joe random nice user it's

329
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,000
really there's a lot of complexity

330
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,220
involved in taming that complexity leads

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:46,760
to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of difficulties in design</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

332
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:49,070
implementation you can do it yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

333
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">right the takeaway for you guys is all</font>

334
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm talking about is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a simple</font>

335
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,029
simple thing that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it home</font>

336
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,770
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you work on a project even if</font>

337
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,020
it's not necessarily programming you can

338
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,520
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom up maybe</font>

339
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,260
take a few minutes maybe take a few

340
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,779
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of depends on the complexity</font>

341
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,170
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're doing but I trust me it</font>

342
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:11,480
will help you the basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind it</font>

343
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,160
is is that if you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

344
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,990
components and trying to improve those

345
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,219
components they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be better at</font>

346
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,810
what they do they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

347
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,399
faster they're going to work more

348
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,589
efficiently they're going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

349
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,240
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do their job they don't have to</font>

350
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:26,240
worry about anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that's all</font>

351
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,160
they're concerned about and from a

352
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,260
security perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> too that's how you</font>

353
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">want your programs man do you want you</font>

354
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,100
want pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your program to not</font>

355
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,140
affect any other piece of another

356
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,550
program or hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might you might be</font>

357
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,140
dealing with vulnerabilities and like

358
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,209
I'm saying lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really effective</font>

359
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:50,180
pieces lead to extremely effective

360
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:52,069
systems as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said before in the</font>

361
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,599
beginning the AI community promised it

362
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,720
could deliver all sorts of amazing

363
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:01,399
results and they failed they were trying

364
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,650
too hard to take a few extremely smart

365
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:07,459
guys put them in a room and say we need

366
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:10,908
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build everything from scratch</font>

367
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,409
from the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they tried but it just</font>

368
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:14,899
fell apart it's just unwieldy the

369
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:17,659
problems are too complex it's just hard

370
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:21,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to just drill down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the right grandeur</font>

371
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:23,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">ality to do every little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing one thing</font>

372
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> evolved from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp which</font>

373
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:27,520
is relatively compared to other

374
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:30,580
programming languages while it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bit</font>

375
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,408
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and weird to a lot of people</font>

376
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,149
syntactically it's very simple it's it's

377
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:37,010
basically you have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kinds</font>

378
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:40,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">of expressions and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else</font>

379
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:44,299
is a lisp list data code all the same

380
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,140
pretty simple compared to operator

381
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:51,500
overloading rules in the c++ for example

382
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:53,240
from all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this along these same lines</font>

383
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,760
which is exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about</font>

384
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,610
we have our UNIX in our Linux command

385
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,450
line interface tools you've got

386
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything from net cat cat grep more</font>

387
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,529
pretty much every tool that you use on

388
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,029
the terminal every day each one most I

389
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:11,029
don't know if you guys are in with the

390
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:15,470
more less thing now there's most most is

391
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:17,120
good you can put all of these you can

392
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">put all of these little utilities which</font>

393
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,549
do their simple jobs very well together

394
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:25,029
to produce scripts better basically

395
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:30,740
themselves even better utilities

396
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:33,200
basically the sum is greater the sum of

397
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,600
all the parts is greater than each part

398
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,090
alone because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the way it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

399
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,389
and same kind of thing like dude

400
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:44,439
yesterday was talking about in the AI or

401
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:48,140
in the malware talk using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

402
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,960
pool as a as a reference point for

403
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,520
finding new malware I mean each part by

404
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,419
itself is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that strong but together</font>

405
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does a lot more Firefox metasploit</font>

406
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:00,500
and emacs whether you love it or hate it

407
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,820
are examples of such programs that are

408
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:09,740
extensible and you can create many many

409
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:11,539
many far-ranging tools and etc and both

410
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">in any of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things so you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

411
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover all kinds of ground you don't have</font>

412
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,929
to do as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> work because you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

413
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,400
focusing on your goal it's like if you

414
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:24,270
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a Metasploit module two</font>

415
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,190
the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> Debian ssh vulnerability taken</font>

416
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,840
care of that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you have to write for</font>

417
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:32,360
anything else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just write your code</font>

418
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,360
get to focus on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously it's easier</font>

419
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:38,400
top-down design is just so complicated

420
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,660
because they're just and with most

421
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,490
problems you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

422
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,890
everything and once you commit to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

423
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,660
design it's really really difficult to

424
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,730
change it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> account for something new</font>

425
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,920
that you learn later with bottom-up

426
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,230
design you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all you can</font>

427
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,780
deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just</font>

428
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:57,870
basically putting pieces together so all

429
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change your glue the</font>

430
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,489
minimum cost is as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

431
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">few minutes maybe a few hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this will</font>

432
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,810
impact you in the future because all of

433
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,320
your current projects using bottom-up

434
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,850
design will feed into later projects

435
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,439
using bottom-up design because you're

436
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:19,280
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything together into a</font>

437
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:21,720
coherent system you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

438
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,090
consciously engage in this sort of

439
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,220
exercise as probably many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you already</font>

440
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,290
do some of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your own do I mean</font>

441
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,800
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pick and choose where</font>

442
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,060
needed one very important thing is you

443
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,850
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep your connections between</font>

444
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,200
components as simple as possible and we

445
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,659
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> found this out because I was</font>

446
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,630
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring an actual demo for</font>

447
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys but the connections were not as</font>

448
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,680
simple as they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been because</font>

449
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,130
we wanted it to fit later designs and we

450
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,550
failed long story short make your you

451
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make your tool or component</font>

452
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,790
or whatever you're working on as

453
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,580
interoperable with everything else that

454
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly can I mean it should be</font>

455
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to work by itself you should be</font>

456
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,930
able to adapt it to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> another system</font>

457
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,460
or even compiled code because they allow

458
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,320
it it should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work as a</font>

459
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">Firefox extension you should be able to</font>

460
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrap it in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox extension and</font>

461
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,380
therefore extend Firefox with your tool

462
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,449
which does its job really well everyone

463
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,190
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and we all benefit</font>

464
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially if it's open source because</font>

465
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:29,240
it goes back in to the pool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all</font>

466
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,240
share which we all like

467
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:39,759
my example is a where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were working on</font>

468
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:42,129
with a viruses sniffer project just a

469
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,320
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> little module class it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

470
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:47,250
not important all that's very important

471
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,820
is the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center functions you have a</font>

472
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:57,309
load that consumed in ass a thing which

473
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:59,200
then equates to an actual C or C++ file

474
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:04,139
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have these functions that</font>

475
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,429
match these values as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see though</font>

476
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:08,439
complexity will bite you on the ass if

477
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:13,480
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the left that's just a</font>

478
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:15,610
portion of our project and the demo that

479
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,990
I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you we built our</font>

480
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:23,549
chest rig and as you can see down here

481
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:27,940
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle ah there's a nice little</font>

482
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:29,918
failure to use my object though we tried

483
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,029
into the last minutes otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

484
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,620
would have had a nice little sniffer

485
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:38,220
demo but as you can see it does work and

486
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:42,250
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of abstract and not really</font>

487
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,889
too much point but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

488
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,539
questions please go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask one</font>

489
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:48,549
final thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've definitely forgot</font>

490
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:50,710
to mention is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only is this something</font>

491
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:54,519
that the AI community learned but

492
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:57,299
indirect reference to the malware's

493
00:22:54,519 --> 00:23:00,039
topic malware talk yesterday the<font color="#CCCCCC"> artists</font>

494
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:01,779
the antivirus community has also learned

495
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,639
this they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design top-down</font>

496
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:05,350
solutions hey man we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have a</font>

497
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:09,610
signature hash for every virus that'll

498
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:11,009
always work oh no it doesn't it's just

499
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,408
really best to go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

500
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:18,850
lots of experience has shown this try

501
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:20,090
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply it it's all I can say any</font>

502
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:24,889
questions

503
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:46,629
I guess then without further ado virus

504
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:49,130
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be up design damn short people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

505
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:56,960
what is my toolbox needed some forklift

506
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:59,659
um let's hang so what my talk is

507
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,360
basically is a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long gated</font>

508
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:04,429
version of a dinner session and a little

509
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit alcohol and basically I was sitting</font>

510
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:08,840
around with a friend we were talking

511
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game and stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it did</font>

512
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,370
that we didn't like and how rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

513
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,658
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do we wanted to do</font>

514
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,840
within the systems of the game we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

515
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">just break it how many of you have ever</font>

516
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,770
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reverse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol for</font>

517
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,059
something simple like you know

518
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,668
highlighting a word or you know catching

519
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:29,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">sun yeah okay it's always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> harder than it</font>

520
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:31,549
starts out isn't it<font color="#CCCCCC"> track to life right</font>

521
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,740
well after thinking about it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

522
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:37,850
really think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so almost every again but</font>

523
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically talking about network stuff</font>

524
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:42,439
most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but this will get</font>

525
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">brighter as we go on so almost every</font>

526
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,390
sniffer out there because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font>

527
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,770
we're going to reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

528
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:50,270
protocol you're going to have to sniff

529
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:52,129
stuff uses pick up most of them are not

530
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,658
application specific you know it's not

531
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh it only six packets for this</font>

532
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,330
application and then displays them a

533
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,029
certain way older they're all some out

534
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:01,220
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and most of them provided some</font>

535
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:03,980
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> user interface to get your data</font>

536
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,720
out which tends to be cryptic you know

537
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,460
Oh TCP dummbell do everything you want

538
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,630
to do okay seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen some</font>

539
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,980
really great pack and injures but I

540
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,600
don't give a crap who you are that crap

541
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,159
is hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read and you know it okay</font>

542
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,120
nobody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stir it heads for the</font>

543
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">rest of their life they just don't want</font>

544
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,289
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it most of the network sniffer is</font>

545
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,309
an army to do something specific like

546
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:24,500
there's a name sniffer out there I

547
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:27,620
forget what it's called Cain<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Abel</font>

548
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,059
does a lot of VoIP stuff editor cap is

549
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,689
really big<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> injection there's a couple</font>

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,770
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords with like palm and</font>

552
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,899
whatever almost all of them suffer from

553
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> false-positive problem or errors on</font>

554
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,330
the network because they're too specific

555
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,410
almost all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've haven't</font>

556
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,389
found one that doesn't suffer from this

557
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,680
stuffers from developmental stagnation

558
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,180
were pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much somebody made it for a</font>

559
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,830
specific job and it worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for about</font>

560
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,650
maybe six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months and then everybody</font>

561
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,909
forgot about it or the protocol changed

562
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,160
and just stopped being developed which

563
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:59,190
is a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the drain or</font>

564
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,170
security yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> even your packet sniffer</font>

565
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:04,080
can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security risk how many of you</font>

566
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:09,210
use wireshark and not ethereal mm-hmm

567
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,710
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you use kismat okay if you</font>

568
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,780
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from your packet manager or</font>

569
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,220
package manager of your distro have you

570
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,899
made sure it's not vulnerable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the oh</font>

571
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,690
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can put an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old white in front of</font>

572
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:24,270
my e said and you don't see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh-huh</font>

573
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:27,870
point made so now what right we have

574
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:32,250
this problem what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it this</font>

575
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">was my solution and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully it'll be</font>

576
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">as cool as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so sushi is</font>

577
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:40,020
my attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve the problem a closer</font>

578
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:43,820
look so sushi is this kind of amorphous

579
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:48,690
kind of ultra modular<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox tile</font>

580
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:52,020
program thing blew that hopefully will

581
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,640
take all the components of protocol

582
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,010
engineering and reverse engineering and

583
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,450
make the modular the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that if I</font>

584
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,820
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something that references</font>

585
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,980
data out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple sources so you want</font>

586
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get network data and you know GSM</font>

587
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,470
data like a car he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

588
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing some of the live sniffer stuff</font>

589
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:08,550
well right now you'd have to write two

590
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,130
completely independent libraries 14 p

591
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">cap and one for you know gsm sniffer you</font>

592
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,610
have to invent they'd invent your own

593
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,710
data management<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

594
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,320
before you even get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

595
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,540
do so the goal of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is to kind of get</font>

596
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,189
rid of it um closer look at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

597
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,230
parts the way that sushi basically works

598
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,660
as he calls it sniffers it sniffers call

599
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:30,480
it and it sends that data to two places

600
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> its storage class up here which okay</font>

601
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,710
there's no mouse so you can't there we

602
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:37,440
go to a storage class which is basically

603
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,980
it just stores whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from</font>

604
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,799
either the sniffers or the modules and

605
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alonso's class</font>

606
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:45,340
which most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time we'll just be</font>

607
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:48,639
glorified pattern matching it's just a

608
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,168
big fat regex most of the time but it's

609
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:51,729
modular so you can expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then</font>

610
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,799
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things will go to interfaces</font>

611
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">which will be modular as well so you'll</font>

612
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,070
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at whatever you want to</font>

613
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,779
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to store</font>

614
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,369
the way you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it without having</font>

615
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:05,320
to write all this glue again that's the

616
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:08,199
goal sniffers a an example of a sniffer

617
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:13,210
would obviously be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcap or there is a</font>

618
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:16,179
rudimentary GSM data class I forget what

619
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,950
it's called I fail anyway it's out there

620
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,509
it talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me after I'll look it up</font>

621
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,210
but really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what it is but</font>

622
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:23,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">an example of a sniffer would be the top</font>

623
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,730
couple talks before this they were

624
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about pulling stuff out of RAM</font>

625
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,999
maybe you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some custom hardware</font>

626
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:29,169
thing that pulls out<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ram images that</font>

627
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:31,899
would be a sniffer because that's raw

data Bluetooth sniffers<font color="#CCCCCC"> shmoo a couple</font>

635
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:50,408
that has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with segments to data</font>

636

segments you can turn into a sniffer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

637
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:55,239
is modular so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry</font>

638
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:56,980
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it breaking something else so</font>

639
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:58,330
sushi then takes all this stuff from

640
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,859
your sniffer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> puts it into your</font>

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:03,970
modules and examples of modules with we

642
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:05,408
have this map of how this thing is

643
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to look and there's this</font>

644
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,879
incredibly huge list of modules you want

645
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,359
to build and there's no way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to</font>

646
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:14,559
put it into one slide but like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

647
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,980
one we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing is like a</font>

648
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,629
simple module so that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a module</font>

649
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,480
that take like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> text file as an example</font>

650
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:23,738
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd have hex on one side and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plain</font>

651
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,299
text on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side and it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

652
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:27,549
find whatever you're looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

653
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:29,679
put it in segments the<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of</font>

654
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:31,629
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fuzzy module where if</font>

655
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,850
you have data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't match any</font>

656
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:35,559
other modules it'll kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

657
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,178
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out heuristically try a bunch</font>

658
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,210
of crypto tricks see what works if it

659
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:43,960
works you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn stuff</font>

660
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,789
crypto stuff yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and an output you</font>

661
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,429
know something simple that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can read</font>

662
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:49,269
their you're not looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at gibberish</font>

663
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:52,140
cryptonomicon stuff like that anyway

664
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:54,550
there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

665
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,780
interfaces if the fact that the

666
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,830
interfaces are modular means you can

667
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">display</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data however you want</font>

668
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:05,080
suppose you want to have a matrix Gibson

669
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,020
looking 3d thing that you can grab balls

670
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,129
of data and move them around sure make

671
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">it you only got to write the interface</font>

672
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's modular you don't have to go right</font>

673
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:16,030
the sniffer and i'll either junk for it

674
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,530
the basic like start point for the

675
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,260
project when we release it is going to

676
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:22,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">be an end curses GUI they'll be an ex</font>

677
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,610
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and it will be multi-platform</font>

678
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,660
so I'm sure there'll be a raw one that

679
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:30,129
runs in text that'll work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Windows but</font>

680
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,540
people will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write more and in</font>

681
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,640
the storage class which<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of</font>

682
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,170
specific but basically anything out of a

683
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,800
module or anything out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sniffer you</font>

684
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:43,720
can store in a unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> queue of its type</font>

685
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:46,720
so no no problems there questions on the

686
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:52,390
program what it's trying to solve so

687
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:59,520
efficient general<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then contact info</font>

688
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:59,520
questions for anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're done</font>

689
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,350
all the slide deck failure

690
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:39,140
okay i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have deviant come in</font>

691
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:44,810
here real quick and give the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

698
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,610
a shame none of them were<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here hear</font>

me say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i keep saying ninja networks</font>
