that a professional burglar would take

they take a blow torch to it and

32
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,130
explosive TX resistance means they would

type devices that are certified for

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,970
burglary resistant they also stipulate

61
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:57,700
that you have to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ul</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group one</font>

have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> three experts to try to</font>

manipulate the the lockin if you're

unfamiliar with this technique

74
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,830
essentially they rotate all the wheels

75
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,810
try to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many wheels are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

76
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,190
the lock and they calculate the contact

77

points on the lock and then they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

78

figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the differences and then map</font>

them grab them and then after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

80
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,380
figure out the combination and then as I

said the one hour radiological attack

82
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,630

an x-ray to m 2 hours of manipulation

84

resistance and then group to which is

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,420
what you'll see most you know home space

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> states and stores and stuff like</font>

four a lot of other lower security

100
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,170
applications so they do a bunch of

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,870
testing for the electronic locks a lot

102
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,090
of it has to deal with safety testing

103
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,169
they do some security testing flying

104
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,479
high voltage low voltage current and

105
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,590
jarring attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen some</font>

109
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,010
some historical tax like a punch attack

110
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,260
essentially you know you either create a

111
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,530
hole or use the hole that the mechanism

112

basically open open the safe autodialing

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,460
then figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the combination by using</font>

121

essentially shake the safer device until

they can link the sound to the video of

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,880
analyzed right here you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

149
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,520
front that's the the keypad device and

150
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,350
we hooked it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that same guy in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

151
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos safe it was pretty happy about</font>

152
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:06,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here is an example of the</font>

153
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:09,700
original lock body on the back and as

154
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,768
you can see here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see the</font>

155
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,769
[Music]

156
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the wheel pack there and here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

157
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,870
happens after we installed the

158
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,729
electronic lock on it and you can see

159
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:29,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolt when it when it gets pulled you</font>

160
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:31,480
can unlock<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lock the safe and for</font>

161
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:34,719
this particular lock it has multiple

162
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,820
users it has a manager user and regular

163
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,030
users and the manager can do multiple

164
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,909
things like reset code the user can just

165
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,590
open the lock it has a six digit

166
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,320
combination so a thousand possible

167
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:50,409
combinations or six digit codes down the

168
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,630
possible combinations and you can add

169
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:56,410
users so big<font color="#CCCCCC"> one right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> default</font>

170
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,980
combinations got to love that right the

171
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:02,140
manager code all ones the user code

172
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,120
123456 you can imagine in a typical

173
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,260
installation one code might be changed

174
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,780
no codes might be changed a lot of

175
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,060
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like keeping a default the</font>

176
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,770
recovery code to you can enter that and

177
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,780
it will give you back a random number or

178
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,000
quote unquote random and then you give

179
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,770
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the company will</font>

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,930
tell you what your pin is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

181
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,460
stipulation on that is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be a</font>

182
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,960
certified locksmith to do it

183
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:31,770
so you can see the back of the lock body

184
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,870
here there's a reset button as well so a

185
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,759
typical attack that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a</font>

186
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">stake technician would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do if all else</font>

187
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,539
fails would be to drill the lock and is

188
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,339
to use a small piece of metal<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push</font>

189
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,229
that little reset button and you would

190
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,000
unplug the battery plug the battery back

191
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,009
in and it would sink back up with the

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the keypad and you'd be able to open the</font>

193
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:52,380
safe so this law also provides

194
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,750
bluetooths as well in particular

195
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,079
bluetooth low energy and those who are

196
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,220
unfamiliar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth I think of</font>

197
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,649
regular bluetooth is like headphones

198
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,660
transmitting more data and bluetooth low

199
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,750
energy as like a wearable device that

200
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,800
transmits sporadically to save power and

201
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:14,610
this uber truth one is a device sold by

202
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,310
Mike Osman and the same guy who create

203
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:20,550
the hack RF and it's able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to analyze</font>

204
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,959
Bluetooth traffic so here's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

205
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,870
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth back it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like from the</font>

206
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,369
locks<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you see that the first</font>

207
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,649
package that you'll see consistently

208
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,480
running from any type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dled device and</font>

209
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">this one in particular is an advertising</font>

210
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,589
package just<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you what the device</font>

211
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,509
is you know I'm the lock and it's

212
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,060
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying it's quintic pass</font>

213
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:43,920
through it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives it a ble address and a</font>

214
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:46,319
couple of their flags and then here the

215
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,449
next request is a scan request you're

216
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:51,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially asking for more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

217
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:53,219
from the lock and it sends<font color="#CCCCCC"> back a couple</font>

218
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,110
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that send Zach services</font>

219
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,449
and characteristics essentially you know

220
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,699
what functions you can do can you read

221
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:02,910
from the service or characteristic can

222
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:06,380
you write can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do both or can you be</font>

223
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:08,339
notified when something happens and

224
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,040
based on this information we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

225
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:15,170
calculate a certain unique aspects of

226
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,089
the Bluetooth safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock and if we know</font>

227
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,870
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ATM communication looks like</font>

228
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:24,029
then we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do ATM war driving so we</font>

229
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,959
can basically take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high gain antenna</font>

230
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:32,550
and figure out where<font color="#E5E5E5"> these ATM safes are</font>

231
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:34,739
in the vicinity<font color="#CCCCCC"> so while using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools</font>

232
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,630
the uber tooth one we ran into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

233
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,800
issues one issue that I thought was kind

234
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,470
of funny was a nice

235
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,060
stack smash most likely buffer overflow

236
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,459
here that's essentially you know

237
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,949
overriding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack cooking on on the</font>

238
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:50,219
on the stack there and grading the

239
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">cordon of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting there's also some</font>

240
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">other issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting advertisement</font>

241
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,940
I packets and scan Pakistan actually

242
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,010
receiving a connect request and

243
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,200
Bluetooth Low Energy what happens is you

244
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,850
scan<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests or you listen to the</font>

245
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,820
advertisement you scan request get a

246
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,200
scan response and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you connect</font>

247
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
and on the connect that gives you

248
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,470
parameters and the parameters that you

249
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,899
really need are the particular time

250
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,790
intervals and what distance to jump

251
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,579
because bluetooth low energy will hop

252
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,410
the Hopsin certain sequence so with with

253
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,339
those things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can skip it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

254
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,880
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able that you really want to</font>

255
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:30,000
spit the data right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we tried</font>

256
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,829
next was a Texas Instruments CC 25 40

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,440
and it worked it was great and this is

258
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:43,170
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here of a unlock</font>

259
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:47,250
request and now that we know where the

260
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:50,160
safe is and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open well you know</font>

261
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:53,480
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know execute a</font>

262
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,040
physical attack if we really wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

263
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,490
so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> again of an unlock</font>

264
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,980
request for 123456 the six digit pin

265
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,649
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application and you</font>

266
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,829
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the top request here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

267
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">fffff 5 a-5 a this is always static it's</font>

268
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:12,270
just indicating that it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do an</font>

269
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:15,270
unlock and then the next you know packet

270
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">include some other data and if i send</font>

271
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same request with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same mobile</font>

272
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:22,860
device the request looks like this so

273
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,640
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys tell the difference between</font>

274
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:29,940
the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so the only difference</font>

275
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,060
here is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crc and the RSSI change</font>

276
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,339
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> crc is just checksum and the</font>

277
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,640
RSSI is just the power<font color="#CCCCCC"> level so</font>

278
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:42,449
essentially when i unlock<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lock twice</font>

279
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:45,180
it's replaying the same data so that

280
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:48,740
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do a replay attack</font>

281
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,770
against it by capturing it

282
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,360
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we knew this we wanted to dig</font>

283
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,800
into the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application further to</font>

284
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,779
see if we can decode the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet what</font>

285
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,599
what's in the packet stuff like that and

286
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:01,250
if you didn't look at the download on

287
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,709
google play store you'll notice it has a

288
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:09,230
1 point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 rating and it just says needs</font>

289
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:10,640
work so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the the mobile</font>

290
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,480
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> store because a lot of times</font>

291
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're analyzing mobile</font>

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,279
you other information about the security

stores the lockstate you know open or

going to be opened the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth</font>

300
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:36,020
addresses and a couple other you know

301
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,969
information so looking around further

302
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,510
into the ble co to the mobile

303
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">application you see that it performs an</font>

304
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,860
unlock here and the thing that's

305
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,180
necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the unlock is the open</font>

306
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:53,110
second the ble MAC address the open code

307
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:56,120
and a couple others static variables oh

308
00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:00,110
and and yeah the open code being the pin

309
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you type in so you want to go in</font>

310
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:06,860
which it so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can go back a slide</font>

311
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:09,470
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it shaves the code</font>

312
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,260
it parses it from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android app as a</font>

313
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,600
string and converts it to a long int and

314
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,850
so we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what we're dealing</font>

315
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,010
with in on the Bluetooth packet it's

316
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,649
possibly a long aunt that might be

317
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,600
encoded or encrypted in some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

318
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,000
we had to dig in a bit deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

319
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,459
can see there's a send command here and

320
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,579
we if you analyze the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEM command that</font>

321
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:36,439
eventually goes in to this compost

322
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:38,810
function and it looks a little obligated

323
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,640
i guess you would say but<font color="#E5E5E5"> once we broke</font>

324
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,369
it down we found out that literally what

325
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,170
it does is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes this long int that</font>

326
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:49,399
was originally extreme from the

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:52,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth input activity and then writes</font>

328
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,709
it in reverse order into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth</font>

329
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,949
packet and then sends it out and the

330
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:59,479
funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing was if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search around the</font>

331
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,160
code a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more you can see that</font>

332
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

encryption or encrypt that just isn't

335
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,440

336
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:31,759
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and tested it and we have this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing a wireless and mobile analysis we</font>

366
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,920
decided to dig in a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper</font>

367
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,360
and start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the hardware and I</font>

we feel like any good<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware analysis</font>

369
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,510
starts with a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> tear down because</font>

370
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,180
when you do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tear down you can take</font>

371
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,680
high-resolution photos and identify each

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,790
of the chips which really helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hardware reversing so you don't have to</font>

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,069
keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back with a magnifying glass</font>

375
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:14,180
and looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the chips again and</font>

376
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:17,819
so here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that we have the</font>

377
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,500
entry pad and the entry pad back this

378
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,810
circuit board correlates to that entry

379
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,089
pad then they're separated by a long

380
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,369
cable for pin cable that connects to

once it receives a command charges this

385
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,389
what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulls the bolt so another</font>

386
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,850
thing that we may not have said is we

387
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:48,420
actually bought two devices two of the

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interesting we can see</font>

400
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,590
there's the power circuit here this

401
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,880

402

the keys there's a backlog communication

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a few traces that are not</font>

406
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,370
populated with chips which we speculate

407
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,780
is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they use the same</font>

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,740
productive outing purposes or

411
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,070
development and they were

412
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,020
later on but the most interesting stuff

413
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,629
here is these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> microcontroller chips</font>

there's also another data port which is

433
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:52,510
interesting and possibly a power

434
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:57,910
connection for powering it separately

435
00:19:52,510 --> 00:20:02,679
without a lock body and then the reset

436
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:05,170
buttons here this is the the lock body

437
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,240
itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a stepper motor</font>

438
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:12,580
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> once the stepper motor is powered it</font>

439
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:14,380
pushes a the bolt cool so this this

440
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,649
products to our next attack vector which

441
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,650
being the most trivial we thought if we

442
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:22,809
have access to the entry pad because

443
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,340
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy when you come up to the</font>

444
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,690
safe you're able to take off the entry

445
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,840
pad so you can replace a battery on it

446
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he can take off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the plastic casing</font>

447
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,439
it'd be really easy to create some sort

448
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,899
of electronic device that would

449
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,910
basically sniff on the keypad and then

450
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,970
you can hide it and so if the keypad is

451
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:43,260
a simple matrix circuit basically you

452
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,420
have rows and columns for the keypad and

453
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,800
the top columns or the rows are held to

454
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,179
ground while the others are inputs to

455
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,730
the market controller so any<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you</font>

456
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,650
press something aligned is driven to

457
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,870
ground and then it just that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

458
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:58,270
empty you like registers as a key press

459
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,889
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how we tested it it was with</font>

460
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,470
a multimeter we just tap<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line and</font>

461
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,799
then compared

462
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:05,600
to ground with a voltage difference and

463
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:09,440
as you can see there's a lot of empty

464
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,389
space in the keypad the entry pad so you

465
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,400
can probably attach something<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto these</font>

466
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,950
lines here and then hide it underneath

467
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> input the key of the back pad or</font>

468
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:22,370
back cover on and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be incognito</font>

469
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:26,870
and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it just saving</font>

470
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:29,299
data or sending it back over the air so

471
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,860
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a what it measures when a key is</font>

472
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:33,470
not pressed and then when you depress a

473
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:37,158
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> posta ground and that's what the</font>

474
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,500
device would pretty much do after doing

475
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,590
that we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the data</font>

476
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,549
communication between the entry pad and

477
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:49,428
the back lock the lock body and to do

478
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:52,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it basically signal analysis and we</font>

479
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:54,919
used a cell a logic analyzer which is

480
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,890
supposedly the logic analyzer you'll

481
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,720
love to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at logic</font>

482
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:03,730
analyzer basically allows you to attach

483
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,289
onto pins on electronic board and then

484
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:09,530
record<font color="#E5E5E5"> the digital and analog signals</font>

485
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:13,039
and then you can record it and then

486
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:15,289
analyze it later apply analysis tools so

487
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,690
it can decode protocols and you can

488
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:19,280
script stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty cool we also</font>

489
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,450
use a dedicated power supply because you

490
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,360
should always use a dedicated power

491
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,880
supply keeps<font color="#CCCCCC"> things at a steady voltage</font>

492
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,590
allows you to may prevent over current

493
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,390
and stuff like that and then a

494
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,799
multimeter for your bread<font color="#CCCCCC"> and butter to</font>

495
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,919
make sure there's continuity testing and

496
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:38,000
stuff like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically how</font>

497
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,700
we tested or did<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal analysis we took</font>

498
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four pin cable and we took a razor</font>

499
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,240
blade and we just skinned it a little

500
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,960
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then tap the lines and hook it</font>

501
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,210
up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EA and after looking at</font>

502
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">it we're able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do stuff say to wire</font>

503
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,580
8-bit protocol one wire being clock and

504
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:59,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second wire being both data in and</font>

505
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:04,189
out logical<font color="#CCCCCC"> high is 5 volts logical 0 is</font>

506
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,500
0<font color="#E5E5E5"> volt and when a communication starts</font>

507
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">before it starts both lines start high</font>

508
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,950
and then clock drop and then data

509
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,810
follows right afterwards and then

510
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,090
transmission starts

511
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,280
so the top image would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a command</font>

512
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:20,340
packet in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image is the data</font>

513
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,790
packet state vary in size but they

514
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">always start with a 0 X bite and end</font>

515
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:30,090
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 03 bite and so the data in</font>

516
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:36,240
between the pelo can change in size but

517
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:37,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be invite the this</font>

518
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,390
is an unlock attempt with a correct in

519
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,820
meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we type in a correct pin in</font>

520
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,750
it unlocks e biet<font color="#CCCCCC"> the block body in the</font>

521
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,639
back you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are three</font>

522
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:50,460
repeated command packets they're exactly

523
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,820
identical and then there's a clock

524
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,710
toggle after the clock toggle the line

525
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,850
drops low and then there's a unique data

526
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:02,460
packet and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an unlock attempt</font>

527
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,379
with a correct pin what do you think in

528
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:09,480
unlock attempt with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorrect in</font>

529
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:11,190
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like nothing so something's</font>

530
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,990
missing here and it kind of drives a

531
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,260
question where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think the security</font>

532
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,430
logic is stored I mean if you if you

533
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,470
were to design a walk you would think

534
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,540
that you would do the security logic at

535
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,120
the back lock the entry pad would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

536
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,310
dumb and just send the pins over to the

537
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,989
back lock and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> back lot would do all</font>

538
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,820
that logic to determine whether need to

539
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:35,970
be opened or not but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

540
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:37,800
case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> signal analysis allowed us to</font>

541
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,550
analyze the communication behavior

542
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,550
between the the two modules allowed us

543
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:47,370
to even go in and compare different

544
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:50,669
packets and extract pin data and then

545
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:52,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">also replay signals using Arduino mega</font>

546
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:55,860
which is really cool we were able to

547
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a Sally a capture and then export</font>

548
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,820
it and then Marcus wrote a really clever

549
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python scripts that would convert it</font>

550
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:06,020
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino code and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

551
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:09,510
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replay it which was pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neat</font>

552
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:12,720
which led us to the question why not

553
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,280
create a brute forcer and with the

554
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,320
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> a brute forcer we had to know</font>

555
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,570
like the pin<font color="#E5E5E5"> states before and after</font>

556
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">transmissions the unlock packet the</font>

557
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,379
clock toggle is very important and then

558
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,270
the unique data bytes in each packet

559
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,090
that we would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

560
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">working and timing is also an</font>

561
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,750
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can cut</font>

562
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,830
up timing you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimize it and make</font>

563
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,830
brute forcing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster</font>

564
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,970
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here we're demonstrating</font>

565
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:56,480

566
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,730
operation of how the keypad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

567
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,059
body<font color="#E5E5E5"> work you see we just opened it</font>

568
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,710
normally with ticular<font color="#E5E5E5"> towed and now</font>

569
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:06,499
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different code all</font>

570
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,909
fours for this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in this case the</font>

571
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:10,070
light turns red here we have it hooked

up cool to show show red instead of

00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:17,629
disconnect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and hook up our</font>

forcing on it and inside this black case

577
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:25,039
is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've programmed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

578
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,498
do a little brute forcing and you can

579
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:35,179
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device goes there type 1</font>

580
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:36,649
high security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's open and so and</font>

581
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,499
now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show on the other</font>

582
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:44,600
device with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different in that we can</font>

583
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:49,309
also use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> official as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plug it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

584
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:51,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the power on and boom red lights</font>

585
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,940
open

586
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:00,829
[Applause]

587
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,830
so basically an overview of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

588
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,310
vulnerabilities that we discovered here

589
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:14,010
the ATM<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe wardriving poses some some</font>

590
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:16,679
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you know if you can find</font>

591
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,720
atms you know all throughout the

592
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,130
facilities or even you know if it's a

593
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,960
type one device or you know high

594
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,390
security device to type<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three four</font>

595
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,310
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can identify where it's at</font>

596
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,890
particularly in a building<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

597
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,360
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> money is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at with valuables are</font>

598
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:33,180
and you potentially attack it so it

599
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,189
poses issues the bo is sniffing if we

600
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,110
can know when a device is unlocked and

601
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,670
that poses issues that you know a

602
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,649
physical attack could occur when it's

603
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,230
unlocked I don't know of many burglaries

604
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,870
that happen when they know when you know

605
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,430
or bank robberies that they know exactly

606
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,489
when the vault door is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be open</font>

607
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:52,530
or stuff like that pin disclosure to we

608
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:56,550
can sista sista pin and go back in

609
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:59,490
unlock the lock keypad sniffing too so

610
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:02,490
in this case we would pull off the

611
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:05,160
keypad plants a little malicious you

612
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,530
know hardware device and then when the

613
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,320
person went in and typed<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their key</font>

614
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:13,800
we could also sniff that and then also

615
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,370
lock communication we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also tap the</font>

616
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,919
other line that goes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 44 line cable</font>

617
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,689
that goes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock body we can decode</font>

618
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,480
the communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> and come back and</font>

619
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:27,360
replay that as well and then also lock

620
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,970
body brute-forcing we we did a boot

621
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,969
forcing here showing several

622
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:34,710
combinations but we saw a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

623
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work to get all 1 million</font>

624
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:42,660
combinations so for the mitigations here

625
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:45,180
you know ble locks<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth blocks is</font>

626
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,350
just you know it creates a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot less</font>

627
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,450
security and there's a lot of

628
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,070
information disclosed over bluetooth so

629
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,470
just be cautious you know if you're

630
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,820
buying these devices for you know some

631
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,190
type of installation especially a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

632
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">security installation for protecting</font>

633
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,090
classified information you know we

634
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:04,439
recommend some of these electronic

635
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:07,590
devices are you know less less secure

636
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,050
than they probably should be and an<font color="#CCCCCC"> X 10</font>

637
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,389
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great of a better device I would</font>

638
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,120
say

639
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,960
to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> against some of these texts</font>

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacks the UL certification should</font>

641
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,970
probably add in new requirements this is

642
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,670
just our opinion it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they do a</font>

643
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,960
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of physical security testing really</font>

644
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,660
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw that video with the torch</font>

645
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,630
and everything and they do good testing

646
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,910
for safety and some small electronic

647
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,590
attacks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't really look at</font>

648
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the communication layer or anything like</font>

649
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,300
that and there's not a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

650
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,390
security standards that make<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

652
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,380
this kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and from to keep</font>

653
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,470
adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lock body and all these good</font>

654
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:53,080
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were used to so special</font>

655
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks to Mike for Guinness and reverse</font>

safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and any question yeah</font>

661
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:22,290
yeah you do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to the to</font>

662
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:24,780
the ble device but in this case you

663
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:26,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need a pin you know there's no if</font>

664
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,110
you're used to bluetooth or bluetooth

665
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,910
low energy typing in a pin to pair with

666
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:33,120
the device right there's none of that

667
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,770
you just click connect and it sends in

668
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,550
terms of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

669
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:40,710
there's a good point the question if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

670
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:42,810
in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> was do you need a pair and in</font>

671
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of Bluetooth encryption and</font>

672
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,679
security at the protocol layer you

673
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically have a couple different</font>

674
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,600
encryption options one is don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

675
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,240
zeros for encryption the other is to use

676
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,860
a pin but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well has been known</font>

677
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,330
there's public attacks against that

678
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,000
where you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a tool i think it's</font>

679
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">called crackles to decrypt all Billy</font>

680
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,020
communications using that because

681
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,639
there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million combinations and</font>

682
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,830
then there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a manual key mode</font>

683
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,120
where you can specify one key on one

684
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,100
device in the other and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the most</font>

685
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure way to connect over Billy right</font>

686
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,270
now the standards are coming out to do

687
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,129
kind of a dippy helmet and you know more

688
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:20,210
cryptographically secure stuff but

689
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,210
thanks for asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yeah</font>

690
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,210
yeah so on the lock body when you type

691
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,270
in so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was did you type in</font>

692
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:34,450
to try any<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute forcing with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth</font>

693
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,220
and if you use the lock body typically

694
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,380
how it works is you only get four tries

695
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,289
to enter correct combination if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

696
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile app as well or tried multiple</font>

697
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:45,669
connections you only get on the fourth

698
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,149
try you get locked out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

699
00:31:45,669 --> 00:32:03,730
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a certain amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of delay any</font>

700
00:31:49,150 --> 00:32:05,140
other questions yeah you here so the

701
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">question was how difficult would it be</font>

702
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,909
to get to the lock control board and

703
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:12,158
there's two devices here in question<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

704
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:15,010
is the keypad board and the other is a

705
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,929
lock body the lock body is inside the

706
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,840
states and there's usually a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole</font>

707
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:22,510
that the cable goes through and it's

708
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,639
trivial to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the keypad it's</font>

709
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:28,570
just you lift<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off and you've got full</font>

710
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,890
access right there too yeah you've got

711
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:33,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to the cable you can plug that</font>

712
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:35,470
little thing in exactly now and the

713
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:37,389
keypad to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easy to install stuff on</font>

714
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,850
the front or mutate it or change it or

715
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:42,520
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pops right off also it's</font>

716
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">not made of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very sturdy you know steel</font>

717
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,789
or anything like that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could drill</font>

718
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,639
into it or you know pry it off with a

719
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:51,640
crowbar but on the inside of the safe

720
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,070
where the lock body is or the ATM it'd

721
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,679
be harder to get to you could

722
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,230
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know maybe drill into it</font>

723
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,429
or you know using<font color="#E5E5E5"> other means to get</font>

724
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to that but it would be much more</font>

725
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:07,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult yeah in the questions yeah</font>

726
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,510
yeah a lot of the security logic is

727
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,510
occurring on the keypad that's correct

728
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:36,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I can you say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last part</font>

729
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:38,770
once again yeah so you can pull off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

730
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:42,809
keypad and you're saying that you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

731
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:46,540
a new keypad right yeah there is a link

732
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:49,178
message that sent that sends basically

733
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,770
talks with it before they need to link

734
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:53,050
up with a certain device before the

735
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">unlock commands are sent and it won't</font>

736
00:33:53,050 --> 00:34:00,040
work if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on another keypad</font>

737
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,380
yeah you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put press the reset</font>

738
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:08,529
button to associate a new keypad with

739
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:10,450
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device the brute forcer was</font>

740
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:15,929
brute forcing the lock body on the back

741
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:15,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">just by executing unlocked command yeah</font>

742
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:28,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright that's it thank you very much</font>

743
