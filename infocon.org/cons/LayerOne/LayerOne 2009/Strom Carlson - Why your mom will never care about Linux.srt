funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's this this this</font>

subscript which says we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea</font>

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,469
what emergency plan Omega actually is

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,160
we're pretty sure it's panic but

21
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,400
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ask Strom to give a talk</font>

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,450
so so so I mean they kind of asked me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,860

never going to talk never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to care</font>

61
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,590

64
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:28,560

67
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,549

69
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">announced about six months before it</font>

70
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,609
went on sale and everyone started

71
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:51,239
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this thing like really</font>

72
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,590
really really talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and they</font>

73
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,080
were saying all these things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

74
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,459
they all they had seen was one demo but

75
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,620
Steve Jobs gave in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keynote right</font>

76
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,680
they'd never touched it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never use</font>

77
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it for themselves they saw a demo and</font>

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,250
they started saying things like this is

79
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be the most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> revolutionary</font>

80
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:12,540
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the year nineteen</font>

81
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:14,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">eighty-four yeah III was I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

82
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,560
was what January 2007 I was looking

83
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,910
online I remember this was what everyone

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,738
was saying there there was no you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

85
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,150
well let's wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see let's see you</font>

86
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,739
know what this gonna be like know

87
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,840
everyone was falling<font color="#CCCCCC"> over themselves to</font>

88
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,600
praise this thing I'm thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to myself</font>

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,638
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly</font>

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,440
typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim but fairly typical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

91
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,760
people were saying right but let me let

92
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,500
me think about this claim for a second

93
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,120
you know it seems like a calculated date

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,090
because the mobile phone was introduced

95
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,240
1983 the the Macintosh itself was

96
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,690
introduced 1984 um compact discs were

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,180
from the late 70s early 80s so maybe it

98
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,190
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most revolutionary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 984</font>

99
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">because some of the other stuff hasn't</font>

100
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,250
really you know it's been evolutionary

101
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,370
but not revolutionary force a ring but

102
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:04,620
then I thought to myself wait a second

103
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:08,130
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you own digital cameras right how</font>

104
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:13,979
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you still use film on a regular</font>

105
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:16,680
basis right two of you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital</font>

106
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:20,010
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't become a consumer item</font>

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,630
until 1988 and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really become a</font>

108
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,659
viable going concern until the beginning

109
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,940
of this decade right and the digital

110
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera the simple little device which</font>

111
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">has now completely replaced film as a</font>

112
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,770
consumer product you know feel most kind

113
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,900
of a specialty item and has caused the

114
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,060
stock price of the kodak company to go

115
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,330
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an irreversible tailspin since the</font>

116
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,710
year 2000 so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling me that the</font>

117
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,320
iphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

118
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,330
that the camera the digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> camera</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

119
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,280
is has killed the market for consumer

120
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:59,640
film is less revolutionary than this

121
00:05:50,280 --> 00:06:05,400
dinkus right sorry at dingus yeah di ngu

122
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:09,120
s not not that rubber boat thingy but so

123
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,919
I mean yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't say this is that</font>

124
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,410
revolution here I mean for God's sake

125
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,810
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that it's only able to</font>

126
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:22,260
do now which we've kind of taken for

127
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:24,900
granted you know so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

128
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">this right why are we so obsessed with</font>

129
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">these toys why do we go so balls crazy</font>

130
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,930
about them why do we do these things

131
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:39,000
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> why are we so obsessed with all of</font>

132
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:41,220
this gadgetry so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a few</font>

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,510
different things right we're gonna look

134
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:49,140
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple right and and how people seem</font>

135
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:51,930
to think they could do no wrong we're

136
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,550
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at Microsoft and see how</font>

137
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,270
some people think they can do no right

138
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,400
right and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at Linux</font>

139
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:05,640
which is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cult of code</font>

140
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:09,659
and open source right so let's start by

141
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,370
looking at Apple Apple is you know

142
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,320
company all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about there are some</font>

143
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,440
people using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple computers in this</font>

144
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,230
room<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's interesting</font>

145
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,610
because Apple is led by a guy named of

146
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,900
course Steve Jobs who I mean it's kind

147
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,290
of interesting when you study the way

148
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,659
that Steve Jobs and Apple are so really

149
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,070
really interconnected the company went

150
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,960
after he left the company the company

151
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,430
kind of started faltering and just got

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,109
worse and worse worse until he came back

153
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,790
and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

154
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,660
and better and better apparently it's

155
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,180
not like there's a cult of personality

156
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,140
going on with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this earth at all you know</font>

157
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,570
nothing I don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that do you but I</font>

158
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,310
mean an apple does make some products

159
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,900
but you're useful i mean these are not

160
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,980
bad products people buy these things

161
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,440
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i own an ipod at one point owned a</font>

162
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,200
mac

163
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,570
until it fell<font color="#E5E5E5"> apart but um let's not get</font>

164
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,570
into that and these aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad products</font>

165
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,099
right but the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about it</font>

166
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,440
is that people are more crazy about

167
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">apple products in general then they are</font>

168
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">about other company products I mean</font>

169
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,280
there are sort of apocryphal stories of

170
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,050
people just noticing that you have a

171
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Macintosh and coming up with our</font>

172
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,990
Macintosh and starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

173
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,920
like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you just love your</font>

174
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:29,830
Macintosh isn't the most wonderful thing

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:31,570
ever and people are a little nuts about

176
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,340
this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean didn't take long searching</font>

177
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,780
online to find people crazy enough to do

178
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,669
things like oh I don't know make<font color="#CCCCCC"> porcius</font>

179
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,209
of steve jobs out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple icons and</font>

180
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:43,809
product photos and so on this is a bit

181
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,880
obsessive is it not I've never seen any

182
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> company's product that people will</font>

183
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,870
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then post photos</font>

184
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,410
themselves not just posing with but

185
00:08:49,870 --> 00:09:03,660
actually licking the boxes of on flickr

186
00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:08,170
I don't know who this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> is shenanigans</font>

187
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,240
right but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean people are undeniably</font>

188
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,990
bonkers about Apple for whatever reason

189
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:17,620
right and the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

190
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,910
bonkers about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple seem to have more</font>

191
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,000
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit of dislike for</font>

192
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,709
Microsoft I mean maybe if you're in the

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,300
Apple camp and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think apple is the</font>

194
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">greatest thing since sliced bread of a</font>

195
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">telephone right and you think Steve Jobs</font>

196
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,070
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately cool maybe Microsoft</font>

197
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,069
just doesn't seem quite as sexy

198
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:45,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">right maybe by comparison to the kind of</font>

199
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,680
cool young hip image at<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple projects</font>

200
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:54,070
Microsoft seems kind of maybe old and a

201
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:59,620
bit fuddy-duddy you know maybe what the

202
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:01,240
hell is that noise<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know and and</font>

203
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">then honestly there are some people who</font>

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,320
look at Steve Ballmer and see not just

205
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,760
this old fuddy-duddy CEO<font color="#E5E5E5"> but someone a</font>

206
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,380
little more evil right and I mean this

207
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,980
this has been going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> for years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

208
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,290
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason</font>

209
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,399
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ridiculous right you know this</font>

210
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">is ridiculous you know this is a</font>

211
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,420
complete caricature a complete

212
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,369
outrageous caricature of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way things</font>

213
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,260
are I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean look Apple does evil things</font>

214
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,639
Apple does good things Microsoft as evil

215
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,579
things Microsoft does good things right

216
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,709
they're both reasonably large companies

217
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:35,529
and I mean we know it's childish but

218
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:37,540
sometimes we do it anyway right but even

219
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:40,990
Steve Jobs said this is kind of childish

220
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,910
right he said we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let go of this</font>

221
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,829
notion that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple to win Microsoft</font>

222
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:48,850
has to lose do you ever remember when he

223
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:50,138
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> this no we had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

224
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,449
notion for that for Apple to win

225
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:54,010
Microsoft has to lose the era of setting

226
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:55,599
this up as a competition between Apple

227
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,939
and Microsoft is over as far as I'm

228
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:03,940
concerned do any of you remember when he

229
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:05,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">said this no 1997 right when Apple had</font>

230
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,720
just bought next and Steve Jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> was back</font>

231
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,109
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the helmet apple an apple was about</font>

232
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,550
this close to no longer existing at all

233
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,079
all right knee said okay well this is

234
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,279
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that's new at killing</font>

235
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,979
the company this is tearing us apart

236
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,740
this childish stupid you know us versus

237
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:24,430
them mentality right this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop</font>

238
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,790
this is over you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly that</font>

239
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,790
lasted

240
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:41,260
so now what's interesting is that there

241
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,210
are kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hugh slit eyes from</font>

242
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,640
Microsoft camp right there's there's the

243
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple fanboys and there are the Linux</font>

244
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,050
fanboys who also<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to hate microsoft</font>

245
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,770
with a passion of their open source

246
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:57,040
people right and what's interesting

247
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,750
about linux is you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

248
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,550
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that just really really</font>

249
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,940
well and there are certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

250
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,729
it does really really badly right it

251
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,360
works great for server applications

252
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,800
absolutely wonderful per server

253
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,290
applications like our<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux servers</font>

254
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,310
during my web server I've got them in my

255
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:17,410
apartment I've got a file server kind of

256
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:19,479
pbx right and yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> for whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

257
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,410
linux as a desktop operating system is

258
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,350
still not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a going concern it's</font>

259
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:29,560
gotten better right but it's still kind

260
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,170
of a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a joke right you know you</font>

261
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">wouldn't really seriously use Linux at</font>

262
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,920
your desktop OS in a business setting

263
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,960
unless all you ever did was work linux

264
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,160
servers right because all you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

265
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,660
really need was the terminal window

266
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,939
right in the really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool-looking</font>

267
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">terminal window and then the thing on</font>

268
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the side that shows you all your all</font>

269
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,560
your system stats the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs be in the</font>

270
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,900
temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how much RAM you got</font>

271
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,790
left and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot right but I mean it's</font>

272
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really a serious business business</font>

273
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,579
desktop application right and so to kind

274
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,720
of see what people are saying about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

275
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,580
we all we have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is go to the</font>

276
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,520
world's greatest source of instant

277
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,190
bullshit right

278
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,540
and and see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are saying right</font>

279
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,610
just just do a search for linux and see

280
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,230
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes up so you know some</font>

281
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,970
screenshots there's just after I

282
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,590
converted my personal laptop over the

313
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,770
right why are we obsessing over the tool

314
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:41,500
what difference does it make what tool

315
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:44,949
we use as long as the tool allows us to

316
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,580
complete a job right I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't go</font>

317
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,810
around looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a cab near woodwork</font>

318
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,430
that someone's put together right or

319
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:55,060
something that someone's nailed to the

320
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:58,120
wall and look at the nail and say well

321
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,599
this is good but he only used a sears

322
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,060
craftsman hammer to hammer it in yeah

323
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,740
all right a hammer is a hammer it

324
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,640
hammers<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nail in and as long as the</font>

325
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,920
hammer does the job it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

326
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,630
why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we so nuts about this right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

327
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,310
was looking around I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just poking</font>

328
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,230
around on on one day i was looking at

329
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,150
photos of torque on

330
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,230
and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> came across across this one we've</font>

331
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,610
all seen this right here's a san diego

332
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">convention center on twitter iron on</font>

333
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,370
flickr and some looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this and</font>

334
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,030
then I thought okay you know it's a

335
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,110
photo and it's from torque on and

336
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:35,439
there's people commenting on it right

337
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,550
now you're something a little weird

338
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this do you know something little</font>

339
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:46,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">worried about this well I look closer</font>

340
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:48,220
right and on flickr there are these

341
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,870
things called groups where you can put

342
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">your photo in a group of similar photos</font>

343
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:56,410
so like you know photos of cats or

344
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:58,630
photos of dogs or photos of glasses of

345
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:04,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">water or whatever your particular fancy</font>

346
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:06,610
it's right and this one says hi i'm an

347
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:10,329
admin for a group called<font color="#CCCCCC"> nikkor 55</font>

348
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,490
millimeter f / 1.2 AI and we'd love to

349
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,460
have this added to the group because

350
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,660
apparently the metadata somewhere um

351
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,100
it's taken with a nikon camera but it

352
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,150
apparently the metadata somewhere tells

353
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:25,690
you what lens was used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the photo</font>

354
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:28,750
so the guys like hey let's create a

355
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:34,720
group only<font color="#E5E5E5"> of photos taken with one</font>

356
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:37,120
specific lens I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> come on people is</font>

357
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">this guy out of his mind or what right</font>

358
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,450
if this is exactly what we do right we

359
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,190
idolize the tools we say oh my god my

360
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,900
tool is so much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than your tool I</font>

361
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,550
love this tool this tool is awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

362
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,650
tool is perfect blah blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

363
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,030
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really pay attention to like</font>

364
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,060
does the two will actually do something

365
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right it's not it's it's now</font>

366
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,239
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a question of this is a nice</font>

367
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,710
photo but it's a question of oh here's a

368
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,670
photo that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was taken with this lens all</font>

369
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">right it's missing the forest for the</font>

370
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,109
trees it's like saying oh this car has

371
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,280
awesome wheels but ignoring the fact

372
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:11,439
that it can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go anywhere cuz</font>

373
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,000
the engines broken right so where'd this

374
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,220
come from right why do we obsess over

375
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,160
things why do we obsessive over these

376
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and not of not pay attention to</font>

377
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,880
what people do right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean like how</font>

378
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,830
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times have you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

379
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,090
device or gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the store and looked</font>

380
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,780
at something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to buy some</font>

381
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,899
some electronic toys and do Nikki and

382
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,310
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

383
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,150
and you can't figure out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do how</font>

384
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:36,770
to use it right and you look through the

385
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,240
manual and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it still makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no sense and</font>

386
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself probably an engineer</font>

387
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,170
built it right and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engineer</font>

388
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,150
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't the kind of person in in this</font>

389
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:50,180
specific case who would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered</font>

390
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,040
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how people use the tool right</font>

391
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,990
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of you know how can I</font>

392
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,830
make the tool all whiz-bang and and and

393
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,540
happy and whatnot right so where does

394
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,760
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what why are we so</font>

395
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,970
test with the tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not paying</font>

396
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,879
attention to how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people use the tool</font>

397
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,470
well I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a theory which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made as a</font>

398
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,680
disclaimer just be complete bullshit but

399
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,770
here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory right think back to a</font>

400
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:20,030
long long long long long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time ago to a</font>

401
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:24,410
place called high school right how do

402
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:27,050
you remember this this this place one

403
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,490

right sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well that's pretty good</font>

407
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,170
right but think back to high school

408
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:48,020
right how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were high</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> school</font>

411
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,640
right and who were the popular kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

412

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:03,530
played sports right which few of us did

really good parties right where everyone

and the everyone came to the party and

419
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,320
God really really wasted you know and

did really<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid things you know and</font>

421
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:40,300
and did things and did people that they

422
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:43,850
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> regretted the next day you know</font>

there we go right yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> CCC's now we've</font>

424
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,969
got our own thing what's called def con

425
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,410
which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our reaction to that</font>

426
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:55,460
right but for most of us that wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

427
00:19:51,410 --> 00:20:00,220
right for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way we were in</font>

428
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,220
high school was more like you know this

429
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:11,300
we're geeks right we're a little

430
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:13,159
socially awkward right and yeah a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

431
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,340
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gotten a lot better recently but</font>

432
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:21,110
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in high school were pretty</font>

433
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,790
socially inept I know I was and you know

434
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:30,290
some of us have have grown out of it

435
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:34,460
some of us haven't right but what's

436
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:36,860
interesting about this right is the way

437
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:41,150
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> respond to this in their</font>

438
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:43,340
lives some people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

439
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">god I've got a lot of trouble dealing</font>

440
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,790
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I should spend more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

441
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,240
with people and learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how to</font>

442
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:52,040
interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so that I can be more</font>

443
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,580
social and have fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have friends</font>

444
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,230
right and some people but for some

445
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,760
people this whole social interaction

446
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:05,570
thing is way too awkward and way too

447
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:08,690
painful right so what do we do instead

448
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of becoming social</font>

449
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,160
and doing things with other people and

450
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,830
learning about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world at large we</font>

451
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,900
retreat retreat into our little

452
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,659
universes right with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Commission</font>

453
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,279
in front of us because the machine won't

454
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,989
make us feel bad about ourselves

455
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:25,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright the machine is easier to deal</font>

456
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:27,109
with than dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people we can</font>

457
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:28,690
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine we can program and</font>

458
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:31,580
we can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to exactly what we want</font>

459
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,859
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dealing with people which are</font>

460
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:37,699
confusing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an unknown and</font>

461
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:40,580
unpredictable right and so we retreat

462
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,109
into our own little social clique and

463
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,789
hey here's people who are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like us</font>

464
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:46,039
who are also socially<font color="#E5E5E5"> awkward and who we</font>

465
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,239
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of talk with things about talk</font>

466
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:49,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">about with things that we know about</font>

467
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,809
right we may not know anything about

468
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:52,158
basketball or baseball but we sure know

469
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,918
a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about computers right</font>

470
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,669
because you know that's all we ever

471
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,259
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and they're there</font>

472
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:03,289
they're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of becomes this this the</font>

473
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:05,059
social clicky thing we're now to be the

474
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular kid in in the computer click</font>

475
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:09,889
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of being the guy who</font>

476
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,509
plays the best basketball or gets the

477
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:14,149
most girls but the guy who knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

478
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:17,269
most programming languages or the guy

479
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:19,488
who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know knows how to configure a</font>

480
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">gentoo box from scratch that's running</font>

481
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:27,139
on rocks and and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> has cats</font>

482
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:28,460
pissing on right but something

483
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,738
interesting it started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen I mean</font>

484
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:34,969
geeks and nerds have always kind of been

485
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:39,619
on the outliers of the social universe

486
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:43,279
for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> until about 15 20 years ago</font>

487
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:44,570
right when being a geek being a computer

488
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,869
maniac started to become a little bit

489
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool</font>

490
00:22:47,180 --> 00:23:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and then 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago when being a</font>

491
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:02,000
hacker became really cool right and just

492
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,860
as an aside this movie is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years old</font>

493
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,450
can we please please please stop making

494
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,550
red pill poop pill jokes already thank

495
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:13,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right but what's interesting</font>

496
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:18,250
about this is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font>

497
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:22,220
right this is a lifestyle this is a

498
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,720
manufactured thing right yeah it's all

499
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,160
cool to be the guy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> leather coat who</font>

500
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:31,490
knows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nmap but you know</font>

501
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,960
there's a difference there is difference

502
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the guy between bean guy who</font>

503
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,390
wrote and map and the guy who uses nmap

504
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:42,070
right there's a difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between being</font>

505
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:45,650
the person who's known for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things</font>

506
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:49,730
right and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and building</font>

507
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:56,320
better tools versus being the guy who is

508
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:59,180
all proud of using those tools right and

509
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,689
I mean yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little mean</font>

510
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:07,790
but it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting contrast right</font>

511
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:10,970
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know people who are known for</font>

512
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,710
making tools and then the other people

513
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:16,670
might we might rise to call the tool

514
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:20,300
right but what's interesting about this

515
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:23,440
is that in many geek circles this is

516
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:26,389
seen as something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> strive for right</font>

517
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,790
you it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like you're the cool</font>

518
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,130
person if you've got the Ubuntu shirt

519
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,810
right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool person if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

520
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,420
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the konig Oliver to AG</font>

521
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,070
you're the cool person if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

522
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:43,730
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to configure 35 different types</font>

523
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:46,550
of web web servers right and yet we make

524
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:50,330
fun of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people for listening to certain</font>

525
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:54,560
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of music right or shopping at</font>

526
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:58,300
specific stores or for buying only

527
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific kinds of products right and yet</font>

528
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:04,280
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing that's going on</font>

529
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,168
right we're building identity around

530
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,990
these things we use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things we</font>

531
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:11,539
consume and these things we buy rather

532
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:14,380
than building our identity around the

533
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:17,090
way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the world better right I</font>

534
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,730
mean yeah it's all fine and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

535
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:23,780
set up in you 100 computers for an

536
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:25,549
office right but how about being proud

537
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,690
that you not only set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 computers</font>

538
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the office but that you figure out</font>

539
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,299
how to make the office function more

540
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,289
efficiently right and rather than just

541
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:36,289
saying you know oh I set up the

542
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:37,610
computers but and I'm the kingship

543
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:41,840
because I set up all the computers and

544
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:43,189
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of that right we</font>

545
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,580
build our identity identity around these

546
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,020
tools I mean it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where you</font>

547
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,360
know you start talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

548
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,450
specific favorite flavor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of linux and</font>

549
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,620
then someone next to you who thinks

550
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,030
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most evil thing of the</font>

551
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,668
universe because<font color="#E5E5E5"> their flavor of linux</font>

552
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,490
is better starts deciding that you are

553
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:02,750
the most evil<font color="#E5E5E5"> person in existence</font>

554
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:06,380
because you like debian<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they like</font>

555
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:10,190
gin too right this is ridiculous but we

556
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,929
all do it and I guess kind of the

557
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,070
interesting social engineering upshot of

558
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:14,059
this is that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

559
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,720
advantage when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

560
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:23,510
support for linux right because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

561
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:25,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">go on to the channel and you say you</font>

562
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,919
know hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked politely like the</font>

563
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,450
instructions tell you to and you ask

564
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,890
your well research question you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

565
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,840
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> politely hey I'm having some</font>

566
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,220
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this auto configuration on</font>

567
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,980
older p4 machine you would anyone mind

568
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:41,470
giving me some assistance what happens

569
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,470

570
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:47,360
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know you sit there for</font>

571
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:49,070
an F for three hours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you repeat your</font>

572
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,719
question every 15 minutes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and</font>

573
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:57,320
nothing happens but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can if you</font>

574
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,090
insult the product and therefore insult

575
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,178
the people who use it because they built

576
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:05,840
their identity around this product right

577
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:07,370
and you rant you say yeah this is a

578
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of crap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is totally fucking useless</font>

579
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,668
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto configuration will work</font>

580
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,340
correctly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was p4 machine I don't know</font>

581
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:14,440
why I'm raising my time on this garbage

582
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,428
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I actually had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

583
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,830
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this auto</font>

584
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:25,040
config working I had to resort to this

585
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:26,899
exact line right and then I got

586
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,309
responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> not these actual responses but</font>

587
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,309
I got responses very similar to these

588
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,510
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I I made these all up but</font>

589
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:52,370
but this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical of what I saw</font>

590
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:55,970
right and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting because we're</font>

591
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:59,600
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> obsessed with tools right simple</font>

592
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:01,390
tools complex tools but they are in fact

593
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,840
tools that were being obsessed over

594
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:07,280
right there just means to an end they're

595
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,049
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends in and of themselves they're</font>

596
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,570
not worth getting all uptight and hot

597
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:14,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bothered over right and yet we're</font>

598
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:17,899
totally obsessed with these things we

599
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:22,220
are totally we live our lives based

600
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:28,360
around these goddamn machines you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

601
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:32,530
and think about it right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

602
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:37,100
machines in all of your garages

603
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:43,129
apartments cars whatever right machines

604
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:47,178
that 10 years ago were awesome right I

605
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:50,310
was at what I was at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> swap meet in</font>

606
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:52,590
Los Angeles recently

607
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:55,830
and I was poking around and yeah you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

608
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:59,580
get all sorts of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> rip off athletic</font>

609
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:03,449
shoes and and and fruits of questionable

610
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:05,610
origin and you know leather wallets and

611
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,010
DVDs and so on but i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a booth where</font>

612
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,919
someone was selling you know old

613
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,360
cordless phones and old computer

614
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,960
equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was poking around and hey</font>

615
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,010
there's a palm<font color="#E5E5E5"> five just gathering dust</font>

616
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,900
and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still use a palm</font>

617
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:24,000
five right or any sort of Palm Pilot

618
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,890
right there are things which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

619
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,500
gathering<font color="#E5E5E5"> dust in all of our apartments</font>

620
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,510
with teams of people poured hundreds of

621
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,890
hours of their lives thousands of hours

622
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,840
of their lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> into building and</font>

623
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:37,730
creating and perfecting that none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

624
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,780
use anymore that are totally obsolete

625
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,870
that don't make a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore</font>

626
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:46,290
right yeah we learned things from them

627
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,800
and we've built upon them but there are

628
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:51,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">many things which was dead ends and</font>

629
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,879
there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things which debt were</font>

630
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,010
dead ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people got really really</font>

631
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,650
excited about and thought were the

632
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:01,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">future right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I'm sure you can</font>

633
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,760
think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> something which people would</font>

634
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:05,850
think of as a joke in which in

635
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,500
retrospect was a joke right but which

636
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,790
you thought was pretty cool in which you

637
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,770
thought was worth devoting your time and

638
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:15,540
effort to right so this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

639
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,950
getting ridiculous because<font color="#E5E5E5"> like again</font>

640
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,750
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the point where we were</font>

641
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,490
building things without considering the

642
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,780
people who are gonna have to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

643
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,760
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean for God's sake how many</font>

644
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,480
times have you tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use some linux</font>

645
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,850
tool that some linux tool wrote right

646
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,380
and you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do something with it and</font>

647
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,699
you can't figure out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it you</font>

648
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,260
can't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the error message and</font>

649
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,230
the man page is completely fucking

650
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:42,750
useless right how how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times have</font>

651
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:45,480
you done that right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean look if we</font>

652
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,160
don't understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are</font>

653
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">using these tools if we don't understand</font>

654
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,030
why we're building these tools the tools

655
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,919
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become more and more and more</font>

656
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:57,920
and more useless I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> look already</font>

657
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,950
half your parents can't use a computer

658
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,240
you know me mine have gotten better

659
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,029
certainly I've managed to train them

660
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,919
into

661
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,450
able to use the computer and

662
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,210
troubleshoot things themselves but still

663
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,379
it's tough it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tough if you</font>

664
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,210
don't grow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the stuff you</font>

665
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:15,399
cannot grasp it and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font>

666
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,859
building these things are young they are

667
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:21,119
young people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you and I younger than</font>

668
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:23,799
me younger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> you right people who</font>

669
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,499
have grown up around the stuff and love

670
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:31,059
the technology but don't get how people

671
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:32,259
work so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this right how do</font>

672
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:33,969
we save the world because if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

673
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:35,649
fix this if we don't save this right

674
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:36,940
things are just gonna get worse and

675
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:38,709
worse and worse and worse and worse and

676
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">more and more and more and more and more</font>

677
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,299
unmanageable until you're trying to

678
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,070
order drinks out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a drink</font>

679
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:47,259
dispenser everything has a comes out

680
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:53,080
tasting almost but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite entirely</font>

681
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:54,909
unlike tea right so first off we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

682
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,428
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technology doesn't</font>

683
00:31:54,909 --> 00:32:04,029
matter anymore right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

684
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:05,499
tool it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the tool does it's</font>

685
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:08,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how the technology makes our lives</font>

686
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:13,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">better and more efficient and easier to</font>

687
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:15,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">live right I mean yeah it's great that I</font>

688
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,499
can now talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anyone anywhere at any</font>

689
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,869
time right but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole slew of</font>

690
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:22,299
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the phone in general right</font>

691
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:24,189
there's a whole slew of problems with

692
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:27,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way the phone itself actually works</font>

693
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:31,059
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> look my favorite mobile phones</font>

694
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:33,460
were the ones that just you know you

695
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:35,320
picked it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you dialed the number and</font>

696
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,749
you called and you talked on the phone

697
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,119
right I mean yeah I like be able to

698
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:43,570
browse the web and I like being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

699
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:45,549
you know SSH from my phone and I like

700
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,968
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to have my phone connect to</font>

701
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:50,859
my laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get online but you</font>

702
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:53,769
know I don't like the fact that I have

703
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:55,570
to actually spend time<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuring my</font>

704
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:57,460
phone to get it to work the way I want

705
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:02,769
it because by default it's a piece of

706
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:05,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">shit right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm horrified when I go into</font>

707
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:06,940
coffee shops now because remember when

708
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:10,479
people used to go into coffee shops and

709
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,489
talk to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and now people</font>

710
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:14,109
go into coffee shops and plop down the

711
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:15,279
laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> and open up the laptop and they</font>

712
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:18,599
sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they type in they type in</font>

713
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,599
the type and all you see is this

714
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:24,649
for 30 minutes on end right you see the

715
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:27,290
tops of people's heads and no one talks

716
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to each other because they're all</font>

717
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,280
talking to everyone else they're all

718
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,210
talking to their friends in Milwaukee

719
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:38,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> South</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Paulo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Cape Town and</font>

720
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:40,820
Germany but not the person next to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

721
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:43,159
right where we're so disconnected from

722
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,389
each other through this technology of

723
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:50,270
communication right and we're obsessed

724
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,580
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the tools are so</font>

725
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,550
over taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> our lives now that we are</font>

726
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,530
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seek out each other through</font>

727
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,760
the tools because none of us remember

728
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:03,830
how to deal with each other in person

729
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:05,810
anymore you know we have discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

730
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,730
people are more important the technology

731
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,409
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap doesn't matter and you know it</font>

732
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:12,080
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet we still go crazy</font>

733
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,460
about it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> replace</font>

734
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,600
these things every few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

735
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,199
they wear out and break because of

736
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:20,330
design like shit you know we we have we

737
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,580
get into arguments over what tool is

738
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,980
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we get into arguments</font>

739
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,900
over what tool does the better job right

740
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's not like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get get an</font>

741
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:33,170
arguments over well you know this pen

742
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:35,780
writes better than that pen or this

743
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">glass is better than that glass you know</font>

744
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,650
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into arguments over these</font>

745
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,509
complicated tools we've dug ourselves

746
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,980
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this into this hole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right because</font>

747
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,230
we're so obsessed with the tool that we

748
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:49,550
we've forgotten that people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

749
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:51,050
the tools I wait to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

750
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,520
bullshit where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> build our identity</font>

751
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,590
around the tool we use I mean yeah it's

752
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,870
all fine and well to be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

753
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:59,300
configure a linux server because that's

754
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:00,950
a useful skill because you can do

755
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">something with it right you can make it</font>

756
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:07,910
serve web pages that let people get to

757
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,250
information right or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build</font>

758
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:14,450
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really awesome tool it's awesome</font>

759
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:16,880
because it never goes down right you've

760
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:19,430
got system<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up so that if one fails a</font>

761
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,930
backup system<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there so if people can</font>

762
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,759
get to the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> or people can</font>

763
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,919
communicate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other or people</font>

764
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,370
can buy things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their underwear at</font>

765
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,109
home in 24 hours a day right you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

766
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:33,078
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to do things</font>

767
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:36,558
to make the quality of life better right

768
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:38,630
but not this whole you know this whole

769
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,069
nonsense where you build your identity

770
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,569
around the tool you use and your

771
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:44,680
identity is depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that tool I</font>

772
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:48,529
mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this right</font>

773
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:52,249
we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this who like</font>

774
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:54,769
for example IT manager at a company or a

775
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:57,379
network manager at a company right so

776
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:59,439
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

777
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,519
network the way the network works and

778
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,970
you go to the network manager and you

779
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,669
say hey I found this problem this

780
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,988
doesn't work for me I think I know how

781
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,170
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for people because</font>

782
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:14,029
people are having trouble with us right

783
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:16,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network manager who gets that the</font>

784
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:19,549
network is a tool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to do</font>

785
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:21,470
things with will say to you you know

786
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:22,670
you're right that is a bad way of doing

787
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,890
things why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we work together on</font>

790
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,190
for you right versus the person who

791
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:32,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't get people and the person who</font>

792
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't understand people and the person</font>

793
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:36,680
who thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the tool is the end-all</font>

794
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:40,249
and be-all<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go fuck you and off my</font>

795
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:44,288

00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:55,130
of authority and what do they do they

800
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:56,630
say well we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500 servers running</font>

801
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,130
debian but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should move them</font>

802
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:02,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">all to Gentoo because i like gentoo</font>

805
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:12,829
admit and really the problems we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

806
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:17,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">get away from these damn things more</font>

807
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:19,009
often you know me to get out we need to

808
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:20,839
interact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other and yeah we're</font>

809
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:22,670
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a convention and we do interact</font>

810
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,130
with each other and we go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

811
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:27,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk and we we eat together and we we</font>

812
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,799
chat and we have a good time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there</font>

813
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">is still the story of the person who</font>

814
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:35,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows up at DEFCON with the laptop and</font>

815
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:40,029
finds a power outlet in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hallway and</font>

816
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:43,610
plugs in and sits down on Friday and

817
00:37:40,029 --> 00:37:45,470
doesn't move until the end of sunday

818
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:50,150
except to maybe go to the toilet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

819
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:51,290
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eat right I mean yeah it's</font>

820
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,150
great that we socialize with each other

821
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:57,770
but I think we're still too obsessed

822
00:37:53,150 --> 00:38:00,920
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and those of us</font>

823
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:04,220
who are social yeah we get it but there

824
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">are plenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get the</font>

825
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,580
social thing and who are intimidated to

826
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,900
even come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> these conferences because</font>

827
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,640
oh my god there are people here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

828
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,530
have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people in person I</font>

829
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,750
don't have this machine between me and

830
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:19,190
the person it's kind of sad and we need

831
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out some way of making it</font>

832
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">better or if you're still puzzling over</font>

833
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:30,440
the point and as mattrick's succinctly

834
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:33,529
suggested fucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a life because if</font>

835
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,450
we don't if we don't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to</font>

836
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,130
solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem if we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

837
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:39,740
steps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and say hey you know what</font>

838
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,820
let's not promote this whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of the</font>

839
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,259
tool being the end-all and be-all

840
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,470
instead let's promote the idea of it

841
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:47,150
being a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> people one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day we're going</font>

842
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,680
to wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and come to a convention is</font>

843
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:56,170
going to be full of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have this</font>

844

burned out on tech um I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

848
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,240
psychology now rather than tech because

849
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:35,490
I got sick of tech so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know i</font>

850
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,029
mean what part what burn me out was the

851
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:41,160
fact that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to deal with</font>

852
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">people like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time and i</font>

853
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,970
couldn't deal with people like this

854
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore because it was impossible to to</font>

855
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:51,810
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them I mean all they saw</font>

856
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,790
were numbers and and things rather than

857
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,940
the anchors all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers my you</font>

858
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:59,220
know the story the<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking point for me</font>

859
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think was you know I was working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

860
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,890
and opens a company built around this

861
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:07,080
idea of open source software and I was

862
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,339
going around giving classes you're

863
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">teaching classes teaching people how to</font>

864
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,820
use this stuff and so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were soft</font>

865
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,490
ware and there was hardware to that the

866
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,070
company produced and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the class we</font>

867
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:19,020
had to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know part of the</font>

868
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,720
class was she would come and you would

869
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,040
get all this hardware and when I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

870
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,879
go teach us one class which had like you

871
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,230
know 16 you know 18 people in it that

872
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,000
each paid three thousand dollars to be

873
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,520
there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the week only half the</font>

874
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,070
equipment was there so I called up and I

875
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">said you know hey guys um I think</font>

876
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,220
there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mistake only half the</font>

877
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,440
equipment's here can you please ship it

878
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,939

879
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take the course and I can't really</font>

880
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">teach the course let's all the stuff</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">callback we shipped it awesome what's</font>

883
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,020
the tracking number here's the tracking

884
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:56,000
number thanks I go punch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the track</font>

885
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,000
number 2 day air

886
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:01,600
right because all they could see was oh

887
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,710
that's too expensive and there was this

888
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,000
whole culture because everything was

889
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,700
linux at the company there's this whole

890
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,370
culture of oh we can build it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves</font>

891
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,859
we can do it for cheap the first time

892
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:14,770
they sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> me out to teach a course</font>

893
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:18,070
rather than sending out you know network

894
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:22,240
cables they sent a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> feet of cat5</font>

895
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:27,460
a bunch of ends and a crimper right

896
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that was cheaper they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

897
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,150
wasn't that was that part of the time

898
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,040
wasn't in my contract I learned that

899
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">lesson but yeah but yeah but that was so</font>

900
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,610
all they saw were the numbers they

901
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,530
didn't see that hey there are people

902
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,940
here who were getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry because they</font>

903
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:46,030
paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of money to take a course and</font>

904
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,160
they're not getting the course so that

905
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,570
was the breaking point for me that's

906
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of me we realize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this whole</font>

907
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:59,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is insane any other questions</font>

908
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:11,590
accident what<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture the first line</font>

909
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,970
I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you later yeah edda so what</font>

910
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,290
are you comment on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts are on</font>

911
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,569
social media and actually using

912
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology to connect better with people</font>

913
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,470
both across distances but also I think

914
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:23,310
more importantly who have similar

915
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:27,669
interests see the social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

916
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:30,160
really interesting because while yes it

917
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,640
does have that application it winds up

918
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:37,420
being a tool for self-aggrandizement

919
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:39,160
right because there yeah there are

920
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,750
people who use it to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

921
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,940
their friends I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

922
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:45,030
account and I use it to stay in touch

923
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,620
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I know in real life but</font>

924
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:51,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people on Twitter and I'm sure</font>

925
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:53,080
you know of them who use Twitter to try

926
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get as many people to follow them</font>

927
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,180
and sit in and read what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they say as</font>

928
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,799
they can and you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care but</font>

929
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:04,629
just use it to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh look at me I'm</font>

930
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:06,010
popular now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think the term</font>

931
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:08,420
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> center of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lexical on a social</font>

932
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:12,500
media douchebag right

933
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:14,510
but yeah yeah we laugh but it's true you

934
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,360
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who use the the</font>

935
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:20,800
tool to just for self a grandma for

936
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:23,780
self-aggrandizement and so to that end

937
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an algorithm the same</font>

938
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,270
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's taking people who</font>

939
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,830
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to interact with people</font>

940
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,150
giving them a tool to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

941
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:35,900
people and then washing the horribly

942
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:40,240
knees use the tool in the back you know

943
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is my coming around Wow hi tech</font>

944
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:48,770
earlier you spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the big hype</font>

945
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:51,920
over apple and um to be honest both my

946
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:54,350
parents use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows machines and I've</font>

947
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried switching them over to Debian</font>

948
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:58,790
machines I've been tried switching them

949
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,590
over to Apple machines and for those of

950
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:05,240
us tools who are still interested in the

951
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:06,980
tool um but well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know a great</font>

952
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,240
solution is throw away the computer shut

953
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,890
off your cell phone talk to the person

954
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,209
in front of you instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of eating lunch</font>

955
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:17,810
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone while you're on the fucking</font>

956
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:20,840
cell phone um is is the Linux failure

957
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:22,400
just a just an issue of designing user

958
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,580
interface because people don't know how

959
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">people use the systems or is it</font>

960
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:33,710
something bigger than that probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

961
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,080
little column a little column<font color="#CCCCCC"> B i would</font>

962
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,120
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know i have to do a lot more</font>

963
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:41,029
research to tell you exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> why that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

964
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,460
I mean I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have my theory my theory</font>

965
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:47,000
is that you know the people who make

966
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,020
linux software the server stuff is great

967
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,630
because they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use</font>

968
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,070
servers for stuff but the desktop OS

969
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,390
stuff is terrible because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

970
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:55,460
actually do any sort of real-world

971
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:57,589
desktop OS computing so they have no

972
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea so they make what they think is is</font>

973
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:02,270
it good is a good product right but in

974
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,730
reality it's it's it's completely

975
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:06,170
useless<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the real world I mean</font>

976
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,880
openoffice it's gotten better but it's

977
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,100
been a joke for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long long long long</font>

978
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:17,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">long time and it still is to a degree</font>

979
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:17,110
very much a joke any other questions

980
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:25,470
comments so you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

981
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,700
technology there's a lot of dead ends

982
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,410
where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of time</font>

983
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,700
building something that was delivered<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

984
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,859
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't go to work as was a</font>

985
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,000
failure isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that part of the iterative</font>

986
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,440
process isn't that true in the real

987
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,180
world in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our real relationship as well</font>

988
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,740
there are some that are failures or not

989
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,509

990
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,160
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way humans interact well of</font>

00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,310
were going to be dead ends and things

993
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,350
that go nowhere the the point wasn't

994
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,090
that there are dead ends the point was

995
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:50,190
that there were dead ends that people

996
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">got really excited about and thought</font>

1003
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,560
getting really excited to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and build</font>

1004

1005
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,380
the users and then it turns out it's one

1006
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,340
of the dead ends because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mentioned</font>

1008
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">things I'm saying is you get excited</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing and then</font>

1010
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,799
it's dead and you invested so much in it

1011
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,870
because you thought would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be helpful and</font>

1012
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">then mmm any thoughts on that how to</font>

1013
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,770
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that I hadn't I hadn't</font>

1014
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:29,460
considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> that angle actually um it's</font>

1015
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:31,440
interesting I'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about it</font>

1019
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,090

1020
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,260
having done computers for as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font>

00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:50,400
have why don't we all have computer jobs

1022
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:52,470
because computers were something we did

1023
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,880
as a hobby we got really really into

1024
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:55,740
them we got really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at them</font>

1025
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually we will realized hey we can</font>

1026
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,660
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cash of this we all went into</font>

00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:02,340
it and our hobby is now our job yet a

1028
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,200

00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it our hobby as well and</font>

1030
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,220

1031
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,830
