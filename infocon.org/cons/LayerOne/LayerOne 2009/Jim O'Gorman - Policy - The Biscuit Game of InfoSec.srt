00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,839
having me so this talk is about policy

4
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:01,140
not anything uber leet we're not going

5
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:05,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk about using a bunch of ds's to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">around with deaf ASL are anything like</font>

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:22,250
that it's just policy that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

10
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,250
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font>

11
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:31,060
because the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with policy here is</font>

12
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:35,080
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to cover it without</font>

13
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:38,140
the politics without the BS thrown into

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,780
it we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're going to do what</font>

15
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can on that front but before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

really dig into this let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me introduce</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">myself my name is Jim I work for a</font>

Midwestern information security company

penetration to us basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking</font>

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,420
into things and seeing how other people

22
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,690
broke into things then I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,060
bit of a compliance and policy thrown in

there as well to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> my to keep me</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">explain to customers that these</font>

individual issues are like cockroaches

and that when you see them you got to

40
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,440
kill them you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

these cockroaches thrive as the same

thing in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network's when we come</font>

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,299
across these sorts of problems when we

47
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,670
find these vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're able to</font>

49
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:26,320
we find that the company has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been hurt</font>

50
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,200
by malicious outsider the vector that

that outsider was able to act upon we

want to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how did that how did</font>

and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time when we're doing</font>

these the outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this comes out to</font>

56
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">be pretty consistent to be a failure of</font>

57
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,859
policy which makes sense when you

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,649
consider the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that policy is</font>

59
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,440
foundational for the whole basis of the

60
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,430
information security program if you get

61
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,200
the policy wrong everything else past it

62
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,340
is going to be wrong is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,660
cascading effect in many respects a lot

64
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,750
of what we consider security

65
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,149
technologies are nothing more than

66
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,200
devices or software practices that are

67
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:23,710
in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enforce policy and if what</font>

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,849
you're enforcing is fundamentally wrong

69
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:32,109
what are you going to wind up with and

70
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:35,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where I think as a community</font>

71
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,830
we're not doing enough because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

72
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,930
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the cool work we all want to</font>

73
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:44,659
do the interesting work well when it be

74
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:46,370
ninjas and that's good you know that

75
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,410
that's what keeps me<font color="#CCCCCC"> going there's a</font>

76
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that couple slides previous I</font>

77
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,690
have breach investigations penetration

78
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,909
test nice and big in compliance and

79
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,640
policy small<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the work I</font>

80
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,100
enjoy doing but in any position you have

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,039
work you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a work you have to</font>

82
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,590
do and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a community we r</font>

83
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:12,340
evading this work you have to do aspect

84
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:12,340
of the policy which is a shame

85
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:23,130
confession<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll make on this is I've got</font>

86
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,710
maybe about six or seven possible

87
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:30,090
revisions of a the same presentation

88
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:32,640
going back a long time where I would get

89
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,380
frustrated based upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that we</font>

90
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,810
see these consistent policy failures

91
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,050
across a number of organizations and so

92
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:43,080
as an outlet I'd put this together then

93
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:47,280
after I put it together it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

94
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,990
gone past now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a while it got to</font>

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,309
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it got to be too much where it's like</font>

96
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,600
okay I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more than</font>

97
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,760
just have this self-fulfilling you know

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,370
put put<font color="#E5E5E5"> my frustration down on paper and</font>

99
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">then go on we got it we got to share</font>

100
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this out and see see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what else we can do</font>

101
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,880
is community because I can't be the only

102
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,880
one having this type of frustration

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,140
because in our absence from this area

104
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,690
who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the work because it's</font>

105
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,530
obviously it's being done and if it's

106
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">not us doing it who is and what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

107
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:31,619
objectives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what why are they in</font>

108
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,340
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it you know is is their</font>

109
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:41,310
objective security or is it something

110
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:44,640
else is a compliance

111
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,800
and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get compliance out of</font>

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,110
the way really quick here because you

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,570
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really talk about policy without</font>

114
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,990
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about compliance they're very</font>

115
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:58,020
interconnected nowadays which that's a

116
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:03,350
real shame<font color="#CCCCCC"> because compliance is now</font>

117
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:06,140
security what compliances is compliance

118
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:12,270
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean that compliance is bad</font>

119
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:13,890
it's no compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is but if</font>

120
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,690
you turn around and you base your

121
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,240
information security program on

122
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:22,050
compliance you're going to have problems

123
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:25,290
and unfortunately that's what a lot of

124
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,780
organizations are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

125
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,820
this is because compliance is something

126
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,440
you can measure something you can have

127
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,240
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> come into your organization sit</font>

128
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,010
down start going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> checklists mark</font>

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,260
off a bunch of boxes and at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

130
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,180
the day hey we're compliant we've met

131
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,630
our objective how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you measure whether</font>

132
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,060
or not you're secure this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not nearly</font>

133
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,420
as easy you know do you base<font color="#CCCCCC"> it upon</font>

134
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:55,020
have we been breached well how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

135
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:57,390
know you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been breached so from a</font>

136
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,609
business standpoint why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you not</font>

137
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,469
attach onto something like compliance

138
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,570
where you can show the board of

139
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,570
directors look we've met our objectives

140
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:20,009
this is where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to step in we need</font>

141
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,500
to do more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than just get frustrated by</font>

142
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,650
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sit around complain about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we</font>

143
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,720
need to step<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and take some action</font>

144
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:35,520
because if we know so much it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:39,479
us to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about it from my</font>

146
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,848
perspective policy has two faces both

147
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,370
the public and a private objectives from

148
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:47,880
a public objective in its simplest form

149
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I consider information security policies</font>

150
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,350
to be about protection of assets now

151
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,670
those assets could be of various forms

152
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,930
that could be ideas that could be

153
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,060
intellectual property they could be

154
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,680
systems they could be people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

155
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">regardless their assets that have value</font>

156
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,199
to the company and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to protect</font>

157
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,640
them and on the surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what</font>

158
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,980
we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that our information</font>

159
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:13,680
security programs or policies are based

160
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:17,310
upon then from the private objective

161
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,359
this is the more accurate standpoint of

162
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:24,390
where we are it's about cya and

163
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,060
liability transference and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

164
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,560
we wind up with with most policies

165
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:35,130
structures within various organizations

166
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:39,029
I was online not too long ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

167
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:42,329
picture which this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of a made</font>

168
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:46,070
me think of how most policy structures

169
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:46,069
are set up within organizations

170
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:55,560
which is unfortunate now the people

171
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the work are they screwing this up</font>

172
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,300
because they're evil I think they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

173
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,300
don't understand what they're doing

174
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:09,029
that's a crazy picture but that's no

175
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:14,579
crazier than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way most individuals</font>

176
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:15,959
see their jobs they're given these

177
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:18,689
objectives they're given these

178
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,750
compliance goals these business

179
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,890
directions and they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really being</font>

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,959
provided the tools to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so how</font>

181
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,620
are they even in a position to deliver

182
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:34,018
good quality policy again we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

183
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:42,510
step in we need to play an active role

184
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:46,560
in this the complexity of the issue it

185
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:48,480
can be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> overwhelming it can be</font>

186
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,640
tough for us and we like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

187
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,270
know the space we like to think we know

188
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,579
this space so how's a layperson a

<font color="#E5E5E5">business person going to really navigate</font>

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:03,810
this and what sort of a what sort of

the breaches I'm saying when I do a pen

195
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,160
test why do I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an organization</font>

196
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,050
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's a mess no one can make</font>

197
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense of what they're supposed to be</font>

198
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,079
doing

199
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:34,260
as so you sit there and you're given

200
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,910
this task and so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you going to</font>

201
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,930
do you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill the role that</font>

202
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:41,790
you see people expect you to fill you're

203
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,130
going to generate paperwork you're going

204
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:50,250
to have a lot of meetings you're going

205
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:52,350
to have minutes and special task groups

206
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,140
that you set up to study individual

207
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:59,310
problems and this whole echo chamber

208
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,980
effect it starts getting created and

209
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,319
then when a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurs no one can</font>

210
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">say you didn't do your job because look</font>

211
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,140
at all this documentation look at all

212
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,939
these meeting minutes look how many

213
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours you spent on the problem of course</font>

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you took it seriously so no one's going</font>

to blame<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so what who winds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

organization's oftentimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's those</font>

218
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,970
with the biggest mouth and the most

219
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,280
political weight and they push their

220
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:35,030
objectives<font color="#E5E5E5"> not any not any sort of</font>

security objectives the other driver is

00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:47,670
an adverse event which may have just

223
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:48,990
occurred I'd be against robots it's

224
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,750
funny but at the same time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

225
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,880
argue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last election was all</font>

226
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,220
about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as a society we've</font>

227
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,220
overreacted to an adverse event that hit

228
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,900
us as a people and to say that it's not

229
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to happen on smaller scales is</font>

230
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:10,560
ridiculous when you're in that sort of

231
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,650
emotional state it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to make</font>

232
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,199
decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you otherwise would not</font>

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:19,790
and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the driver is</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make you more secure</font>

235
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,800
so we wind up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation where our</font>

237
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,140
policies are about what's easy to

00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement and meets compliance goals and</font>

239
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:43,439
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today which it</font>

240
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:45,900
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be that way but for</font>

those responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this work it</font>

242
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:55,170
shows that they've done their job and if

you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that position and you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

go<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward what are you going to</font>

concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> on is it going to be</font>

246
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,420
protecting your job or protecting the

247
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,589
company what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be your driver</font>

248
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,029
there where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your incentive your your</font>

249
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,610
incentive it has nothing to do with

250
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,900
protecting the company has to do with

251
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,010
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you maintain an income</font>

252
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:21,569
stream because who has been held liable

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:23,760
for bad decisions again liability

254
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,010
transference it's the employees that get

255
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:33,150
the that take the hit they take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

256
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:35,550
bullet because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out there and</font>

257
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a little bit</font>

258
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,339
different than what's expected of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

259
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,839
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing to do in the</font>

260
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,830
circumstance but will the company's

261
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,200
stand behind you and that that's that's

262
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,570
rough so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go out and do</font>

263
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,020
something other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than what what is</font>

265
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,579
things I hear when I work with

<font color="#E5E5E5">individual companies on fixing their</font>

267
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,100
policy structures is they ask what is

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,310
everyone else doing what is other

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,650
what does everybody else doing

277
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:32,640

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what jumped out at me is they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font>

288
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,770
the question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individuals do you</font>

289
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,420
feel as if you have to break policy in

290
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> completion of your assigned duties</font>

291
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,060
and thirty-five percent of the

292
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,689
individuals said yes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I look at that</font>

293
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:24,010
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wait a minute it has</font>

294
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,450
to be bigger than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

295
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,280
thirty-five percent it has to be bigger

296
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,680
because these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty-five percent of</font>

297
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,910
the individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a know what their</font>

298
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,410
policy is and B are willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> emit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

299
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,089
somebody that they break in on a regular

300
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:46,030
basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> so of course is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be larger</font>

301
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:48,550
than that if you have a situation where

302
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,839
employees are having to break policy in

303
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> completion of their assigned duties</font>

304
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:56,230
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have it's a form of risk is</font>

305
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:59,170
risk acceptance you're not coming out

306
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,270
and saying we accept this risk instead

307
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,490
you're doing it in your shifting the

308
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,839
liability on earth employees instead of

309
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,560
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the management structure where it</font>

310
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:11,079
belongs and the reason this happens is

311
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,429
because what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the employee going to do</font>

312
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,629
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they have to sign their annual</font>

313
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:19,440
statement of that they understand the

314
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,070
policy in order to get their bonus

315
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,780
oftentimes they're probably not even

316
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,399
going to read what that policy is how

317
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:29,260
good is the annual training do they have

318
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,670
annual training and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk to</font>

319
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,460
these organizations and we tell them

320
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,890
look you know you got a problem you need

321
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix your policy structure employees</font>

322
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,990
are having to it's your policy structure

323
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,970
is is making your employees jobs harder

324
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:46,240
than they need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

325
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,920
responses who cares if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

326
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:54,260
under our roof they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font>

327
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:58,280
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules and to that I call bullshit</font>

328
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:04,760
and we'll use an example we'll talk

329
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:06,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">about removable storage and it's very</font>

330
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,570
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> common for me to come across a</font>

331
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,870
policy statement that says thou shalt

332
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:15,850
not use removable storage oftentimes

333
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:19,000
they'll specifically call out USB drives

334
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:21,469
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations will put in controls</font>

335
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,340
to prevent the use of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> route this</font>

336
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,590
removable storage those controls may be

337
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:32,030
anything from software that runs on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

338
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:35,810
individual desktops down to hot glue gun

339
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:38,840
filling up the USB ports but they have a

340
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:42,200
control other organizations put the line

341
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:46,459
in the policy move on because employees

342
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,640
should follow the rules but if you look

343
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the situation why why are people</font>

344
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,830
wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use removable storage is it</font>

345
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they're evil and they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

346
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:01,250
steal all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP from an organization</font>

347
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,570
and go running<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with it there's some</font>

348
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:08,030
cases like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their edge</font>

349
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:09,620
conditions most of the time the reason

350
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">they want to use removable storage is</font>

351
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:17,810
because they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on off hours</font>

352
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:22,010
they have a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and is it because</font>

353
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:23,570
employees love to work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> home I haven't</font>

354
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,520
seen any organization that's hiring

355
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:30,169
individuals that just love to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

356
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">home on a regular basis but what's</font>

357
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,970
happening is is the employees have an

358
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:37,220
incentive structure they have

359
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:40,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">expectations set up for them as far as</font>

360
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,200
what work is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

done by<font color="#E5E5E5"> what time is they have deadlines</font>

362
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:49,160
and think of this situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

363
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:51,110
kid the kid has a soccer game at

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,560
five-thirty you need take the kid to the

369

<font color="#E5E5E5">leave the house by</font>

372
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,490
I've which means you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

373
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,500
take about 15 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the kid</font>

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly 4 30 it's going to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

376
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,130
about an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive home so you need</font>

377
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,810
to leave the office by about 3 30 s you

378
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,850
probably shoot for like about 3 15 three

379
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:25,370
o'clock in order to get the kid to the

380
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">soccer game at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty so you have a</font>

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:31,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">choice to make is your kid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to miss</font>

382
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,850
the soccer game and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay</font>

383
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:39,260
at work and finish the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have it</font>

384
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:41,600
all ready by the 9am meeting or we're

385
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,200
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw it on a thumb drive go</font>

386
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,370
home take the kid to soccer come back

387
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,900
get dinner together and then sit down

388
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on it a little bit in the</font>

389
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,310
evening finish it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up turn it in the next</font>

390
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">morning and everybody's happy nobody's</font>

391
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:59,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to ask any questions what's your</font>

392
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:03,140
incentive because at the end of the day

393
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,700
the problem is not removable storage the

394
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,270
problem is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to work off-site</font>

395
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:12,370
and have you address that problem in

396
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:15,470
your policy statement I would argue know

397
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:19,959
what a lot of this comes down to is what

398
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:22,850
are individuals incentive structures and

399
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,230
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we're not taking those into</font>

400
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,040
account when we're generating these

401
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,960
policies and there's not just one

402
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,149
incentive structure employees what do

403
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,800
they want they want to raise they want a

404
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,630
promotion they want friday to come

405
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,700
quicker they want to get as little work

406
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">done without anyone noticing what's the</font>

407
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,260
managers incentive gives much work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

408
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the employees as possible so that</font>

409
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,300
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase our payroll</font>

410
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,590
expenses the company they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

411
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">increase your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value for the shareholders</font>

412
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:58,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then security within the</font>

413
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,989
organization there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the only one</font>

414
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:05,000
that's concerned about security for

415
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:07,120
Security's sake so where is the

416
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,120
incentive

417
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:18,720
so we wind up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a situation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font>

418
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,700
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure liabilities shift</font>

419
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,040
down to the user to the employee and

420
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,640
when something adverse happens they're

421
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,950
the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets blamed everyone's</font>

422
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other way when the</font>

423
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,350
employee takes that drive home works on

424
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,270
it in the evening and turns it in the

425
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">next day nobody's going to asking</font>

426
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:42,440

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> USB key is lost and there's some</font>

credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card social security numbers</font>

429
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,970
whatever that winds up being put online

430
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,820
a lawsuits brought against the company

431
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,500
who's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the hit it's not</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">really going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the company the</font>

433
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,990
employees going to get fired because

434
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,990
they broke<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

435
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,309
and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my perspective that's abusive</font>

436
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,360
because we're setting up expectations

437
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:13,340
for the employees but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not giving</font>

438
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:22,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">them the tools necessary to meet those</font>

439
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:26,928
goals policy has to be more than just

440
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:29,480
what not to do and that's in a sense

441
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:34,519
what it pretty much is on most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

442
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:39,440
that I see so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the previous</font>

443
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:42,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">example what can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do we can deny users</font>

444
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,379
the ability to use that USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> Drive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

445
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,419
can adjust our expectations we can say

446
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:49,490
look we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> productivity</font>

447
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:51,019
hit it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take us a little bit</font>

448
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer to get work done from employees</font>

449
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:54,470
if they're not working from remote and

450
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:57,168
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take that</font>

451
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,399
hit because this is a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and</font>

452
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:01,879
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not willing to accept the risk and</font>

453
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:04,090
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that just perfectly</font>

454
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:04,090
valid

455
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,799
or we can say look in this economy we're

456
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,960
not really willing to slow down our

457
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:20,220
productivity we don't want to bring in

458
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,270
additional employees so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

459
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,460
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's going to be some</font>

460
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:28,080
risk we're going to provide employees an

461
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:30,270
accepted method to work from remote so

462
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,189
they they have this incentive already to

463
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:37,799
get their work done let's give them a

464
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:40,350
tool to meet that incentive what you

465
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,320
wind up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in that case is a policy</font>

466
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:49,320
program that's enabling that helps the

467
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:52,500
user meet their incentives the other

468
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,000
aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is when you're building</font>

469
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,809
policy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to realize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

470
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,700
are lazy there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong with that</font>

471
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:04,408
that's human nature you can bash your

472
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,809
head against the wall and fight against

473
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:11,220
that but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just expelling a lot of</font>

474
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:14,539
effort take the fact that people are

475
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:18,480
lazy embrace it<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it to your advantage</font>

476
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:23,460
and this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the most important</font>

477
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:26,250
point here is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take into</font>

478
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,350
account why do employees need to work

479
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,200
within the policy what incentive do they

480
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,969
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work within the policy structure</font>

481
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,679
we need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier to work inside</font>

482
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,679
the policy structure than outside

483
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:49,570
using the fact that people are lazy to

484
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:51,370
our advantage water runs down stream you

485
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your advantage or you</font>

486
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:59,550
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to redirect it somehow which is</font>

487
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:02,309
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more costly other issue here</font>

488
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:05,260
is consumers versus the enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

489
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:07,960
this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm seeing a lot</font>

490
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:11,500
as well we're especially with longtime

491
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,090
established companies where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have</font>

492
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,100
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> expectations on how they're</font>

493
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,309
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate their IT infrastructure</font>

494
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:21,760
and those ideas are based<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon the fact</font>

495
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:24,100
that some time ago all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new product</font>

496
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,750
development was really in the enterprise

497
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's where most of the money</font>

498
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:31,240
was being spent that's shifted over the

499
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,830
years and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> consumer space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is spending</font>

500
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,470
a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money than they ever used to</font>

501
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,480
on these sorts of devices and so you

502
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this functionality that's being</font>

503
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,340
provided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> employees when they're not</font>

504
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,270
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the office</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they come to expect</font>

505
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still always surprised when I go</font>

506
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,780
into an organization and I see they're

507
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,920
still running some version of exchange

508
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:55,928
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 700 mega and the users that are</font>

509
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,480
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that system they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 gig from</font>

510
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:01,620
gmail why can't the office provide them

511
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,120
with something at least comparable

512
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:07,300
people get used to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> this level of</font>

513
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,340
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> this level of products that that</font>

514
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Decatur to them and so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they go into</font>

515
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,490
the office they expect the same thing

516
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,280
and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies are not</font>

517
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,110
addressing that and if you don't address

518
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,990
that what you wind up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a situation</font>

519
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:27,909
where people work around the obstacles

520
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:30,700
you put in place and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my perspective</font>

521
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:34,270
it's better to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a known risk than an</font>

522
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,520
unknown risk so you need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

523
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:40,510
functionality that your employees are

524
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:43,440
expecting and say can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide this in</font>

525
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:46,420
an acceptable manner within the company

526
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,570
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes maybe no but if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer's</font>

527
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">no you have</font>

528
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:55,550
clearly explain why users don't have

529
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:58,310
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mandate it you can't</font>

530
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">just tell them no you have to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

531
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:09,260
a reason it's harder work but if you

532
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">really care you have to do it other</font>

533
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:19,700
aspect policy is often punitive and

534
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,590
that's not a anyone that has kids know

535
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,090
that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sit around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you tell them</font>

536
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:25,100
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen to them if they</font>

537
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:27,949
don't do what you tell them to do all it

538
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,780
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is make them sneaky I'm sure a lot</font>

539
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,720
of people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room can appreciate</font>

540
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get good at evading</font>

541
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,660
controls if you don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> in those</font>

542
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,280
controls you have to deal with incentive

543
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,780
structures is the incentive of not

544
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:47,690
getting in trouble enough to make people

545
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:49,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">do what you want them to do but that's</font>

546
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:55,700
how most organizations are structured

547
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:57,470
that's not that's not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough when</font>

548
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,630
you're building out the policy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

549
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,300
to make sure that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to</font>

550
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,800
enforce everything you put in it and

551
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another thing that just blows my</font>

552
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,750
mind where I come<font color="#CCCCCC"> into an organization</font>

553
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,610
and we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through their policy</font>

554
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,200
and they say look we want to put this

555
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,780
into the policy we're not ready to

556
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,820
implement it yet but we want it in there

557
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,710
so that that way when we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready it's</font>

558
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,810
it's already there for so we don't have

559
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,450
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through our policy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we review an</font>

560
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:29,600
accepted cycle again is it okay if we do

561
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:30,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that no you can't do that if you had</font>

562
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in your policy that you're not</font>

563
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,900
willing to enforce you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

564
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,310
invalidated the entire policy why does

565
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,720

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:46,070
selectively enforcing some aspects and

568
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:48,939
not others that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad idea no of</font>

569
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">course you can't do that</font>

570
00:29:50,040 --> 00:30:03,090
again accepting risk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay our job is</font>

571
00:29:54,930 --> 00:30:06,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">not to eliminate risk you could argue</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the highest return</font>

573
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:13,790
endeavors are very high risk you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

574
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:16,740
decide what is your risk threshold and

575
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,930
how are you going to work towards it how

576
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:23,100
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you going to do that as an</font>

577
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:25,500
organization and unfortunately people

578
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,510
have instruct has been beat up to a

579
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain extent where they're afraid to</font>

580
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,960
say we accept this risk because they're

581
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,280
afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goes wrong is</font>

582
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there but on the line and</font>

583
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're them in the unemployment line</font>

584
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:39,900
afterwards so we have to we have to

585
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:42,480
address that and that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font>

586
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:46,080
thing it's a very cultural sort of thing

587
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,690
and if you want to keep some degree of a

588
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,179
weakness to this when you're working in

589
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:55,290
any of this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> just consider it social</font>

590
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:57,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering your organization you're not</font>

591
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">just getting past one or two people</font>

592
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:03,540
you're altering the entire structure of

593
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:08,550
the organization how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your</font>

594
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,920
organization realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at with your</font>

595
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,710
eyes open and truly evaluating the

596
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:20,100
circumstances accepting a certain amount

597
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:21,480
of risk is fine you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

598
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,300
the policy structures you have to

599
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,800
address the problem not the symptoms the

600
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,930
symptoms is the use of removable storage

601
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:36,300
the problem is employees need a way to

602
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:40,980
work off-site the problem or the symptom

603
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:44,850
is individuals using open Wi-Fi the

604
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,430
problem is secure remote access how can

605
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:51,929
you address the problem in your policy

606
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:53,070
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individual symptoms because</font>

607
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,400
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have an infinite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

608
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:58,560
of symptoms earlier this morning there's

609
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,180
a whole we heard the concept of the

610
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,399
whitelist versus the blacklist I think

611
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,420
that's that's that's excellent because

612
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,570
there's an infinite amount

613
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:09,810
of bad things that can occur but there's

614
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:16,560
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so how do you</font>

615
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:18,179
concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> on those good actions you</font>

616
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,710
have to address what what are people's

617
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,160
incentives and why are they engaging in

618
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,900
activities in which they are and you

619
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,670
have to address that within the policy

620
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,550
structure I keep saying this incentive

621
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:31,710
aspect of it but it's because I can't

622
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">overstate that because people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

623
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:38,790
ignoring that why why do you expect the

624
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:43,050
user to follow your policy how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

625
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:45,389
their interest to do so do they have any

626
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,919
incentive to do it have you made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

627
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:51,810
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easier to do the right thing</font>

628
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:53,640
than the wrong thing and this is an

629
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,860
issue from everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from interface</font>

630
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:00,150
design to policy whatever I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

631
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,590
an ongoing consistent issue but and it's

632
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,260
tough it's tough to find the right

633
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:06,360
answer to but you have to at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least make</font>

634
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,740
an attempt for your organization you

635
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,719
can't just<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore it and say hey it's</font>

636
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard so I'm going to go on to do other</font>

637
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:19,020
things that's just being lazy you have

638
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,179
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let your employees know what outcomes</font>

639
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,010
are expected of them and you have to

640
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,880
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the tools to reach those</font>

641
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:29,550
outcomes again that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

642
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,080
sadly missing from most policy

643
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,080
structures that I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

644
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,870
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing wrong with best</font>

645
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,149
practices but there's nothing more than

646
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,800
a starting point if you blindly

647
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:48,240
implement them across your organization

648
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,850
you're going to have problems all they

649
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,290
are is really just a set of least common

650
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:58,050
denominators and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

651
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,940
enough no they're just a starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

652
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,770
you take them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

653
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,210
there there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be some concepts</font>

654
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,480
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally accepted as best</font>

655
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,970
practices that don't apply at all to

656
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,320
your organization throw em out just

657
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:13,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">because their best practices doesn't</font>

658
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,020
mean that right for you there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

659
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,450
be others that you need to take and

660
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,520
build upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are your business</font>

666
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:43,860
realistically policy is one of the

667
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,140
highest rate of return items that you

668

can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve security to an</font>

and maybe want to filled<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a ton of</font>

heartache because of who you're dealing

00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:20,190
frustrations with this field we all work

678
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,440
in for a long time has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look my</font>

679
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,990
grandfather he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an iron worker and I</font>

680
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,910
can go around town I come from Omaha I

681
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,640
can go around town and I can look and I

682
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,470
can see hey there's the sundial in the

683
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,420
zoo that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he made you know here's the</font>

sign at this at this company that is

685
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,530
still up there you know he's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead</font>

686
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,750
and in the ground for years but things

<font color="#E5E5E5">that he's worked on are still around</font>

people's lives on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> day-to-day basis</font>

690
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,609

<font color="#CCCCCC">still there</font>

692
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:52,089
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this field for a long time</font>

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,470
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the frustrating aspects</font>

694
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:55,420
of it is anything you're working on

695
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:59,290
today is more than likely going to be

696

<font color="#E5E5E5">gone in three years so how do you leave</font>

your mark and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would argue that policy</font>

698
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,880
is where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really can because</font>

00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:13,119
organizations they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain momentum once</font>

700

they have a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that's part of</font>

701
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,020
the corporate culture whether it's a

703
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:22,150
difficult to change that which means

00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,740
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very difficult to make</font>

the changes within the policy structure

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,029
that you need to make within the

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to stay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

709
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,470
long period of time do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

710
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make a mark if so this is where you</font>

711
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:39,990
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it do you really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help your</font>

712
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:41,800
company if so this is where you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

713
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:45,220
I'm not saying you should ignore

714
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:50,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything else now saying the fun stuff</font>

715
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:54,459
isn't fun it isn't cool but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

716
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:57,030
is you know why are you here why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

717
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,170
the field that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you decided to work I</font>

718
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,329
hear a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people tell me that</font>

719
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:03,640
they're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this field because they want</font>

720
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:05,470
to help they want to improve security

721
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:12,160
they want to do this and they spout out

722
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:14,259
these very altruistic reasons but you

723
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,700
know is that really true you know or did

724
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:21,069
you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone to pay for your</font>

725
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:26,140
toys you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I appreciate someone</font>

726
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:29,040
else paying for my toys but if you're

727
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,900
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be using these reasons these</font>

728
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,250
I'm in it for the greater good reasons

729
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,250
then put up<font color="#E5E5E5"> or shut up</font>

730
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:51,000
questions yeah so how do you how you

731
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,280
counter the question of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

732
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,750
you about what are other companies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

733
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,740
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing what are other companies</font>

734
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:06,690
in my size doing you try to approach it

735
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:08,910
with a with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree of tact because you</font>

736
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,280
can't just come out and say are you

737
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,020
retarded for asking me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question you</font>

738
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,520
know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to keep a customer</font>

739
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listen</font>

740
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,290
to anything that comes out of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mouth</font>

741
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:23,640
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to do is you have</font>

742
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:25,380
to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them that a little bit</font>

743
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,700
about what these other organizations are

744
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,520
doing but then start<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

745
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what makes their company unique to</font>

746
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,980
a degree you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play to their ego</font>

747
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:36,089
because everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to think they're</font>

748
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're the lead in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their own story</font>

749
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,110
right you know you play to that you make

750
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that they they understand that</font>

751
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,430
their organization is not the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

752
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,900
every other organization out there under

753
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sudden it's not the same just</font>

754
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,590
because you're a retailer doesn't mean

755
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:52,109
that you're in the same situation as

756
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:53,250
every other retailer out there maybe

757
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're operating in different markets</font>

758
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,890
maybe you're operating with different

759
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,720
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of products you have a different</font>

760
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,790
type of clientele you have to understand

761
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and again it gets back to the fact</font>

762
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,920
that this isn't all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tech side</font>

763
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,730
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to understand business</font>

764
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,500
objectives and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth and</font>

765
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's what you start talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

766
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,240
with the customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what you have</font>

767
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,480
to engage them in so that they they

768
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,990
understand why you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

769
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,730
my point about explaining to users why

770
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,709
it's in their interest to work with in

771
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,470
this policy structure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

772
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,870
explain to to the customer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

773
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:34,919
company why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in their interest to</font>

774
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:37,859
provide this degree of<font color="#E5E5E5"> care within their</font>

775
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,200
policy structure how can it benefit them

776
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:44,880
and what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the possible</font>

777
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,790
consequences if they don't i think i saw

778
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,820
that hand there first

779
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:52,140
what other companies are doing one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

780
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons companies ask what other</font>

781
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:58,230
companies are doing is because of the

782
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,570
legal definition of due diligence and

783
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:03,540
the liability<font color="#CCCCCC"> there from but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

784
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:06,420
the main problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have is with budgets</font>

785
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,279
I'm getting a security budget out of

786
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,710
other departments with other priorities

787
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,780
do you have any guidelines for that well

788
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:17,840
when you're dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy side</font>

789
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:19,890
of things ideally it's not going to be a

790
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec budget you're having to deal</font>

791
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">with its you're not we're not talking</font>

792
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:26,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">about things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are consistently the</font>

793
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:29,310
purchase of new technology and new

794
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:33,750
processes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that sort of thing the</font>

795
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:36,029
real grunt work in this is understanding

796
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:38,670
why is the company structure the way it

797
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:41,250
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why again the business objectives</font>

798
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,720
what are the employees why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

799
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:46,800
approaching the job the way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

800
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:50,819
it's a lot of personnel time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

801
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,470
necessarily product which again makes it

802
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,700
more difficult because a product you can

803
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:56,160
purchase you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put in place you can</font>

804
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,450
hit a check box and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say done now</font>

805
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,200
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to maintain our annual</font>

806
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,549
maintenance contract you know and that's

807
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,089
it doesn't really do the job<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font>

808
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:07,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's appealing so yeah I mean is</font>

809
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,970
budgets they're always going to be a

810
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,860
concern and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have been a</font>

811
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:15,899
concern but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you first deal with it</font>

812
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,340
from from that perspective from the

813
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,130
policy perspective and then as you're

814
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:23,250
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the policy going back to</font>

815
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the to the removable storage setting up</font>

816
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,150
an acceptable method from individuals to

817
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,920
work from<font color="#E5E5E5"> home that may cause some money</font>

818
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:31,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be some product that needs to</font>

819
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,300
be purchased but that decision to

820
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,360
purchase that to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware purchase</font>

821
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,250
that technology is part of that policy

822
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision making process do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you care</font>

823
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,630
enough about providing that type of

824
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,549
functionality to the individuals if you

825
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:47,850
don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to spend that money</font>

826
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:50,310
then you're going to option a which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

827
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:54,750
say no you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed to do it and</font>

828
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:57,870
adjust your expectations neither one of

829
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,790
those is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong answer it's just a</font>

830
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter of what is appropriate for that</font>

831
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization</font>

832
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:08,280
so budget should really be a budget

833
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,210
decision at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's</font>

834
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">about money but i think if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you approach</font>

835
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,770
it from that perspective where you have

836
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:18,480
these choices these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different solutions</font>

837
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:20,069
to the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you pick the one</font>

838
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,180
that's appropriate budget is secondary

839
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:22,680
then at that point because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

840
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:32,899
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> made that decision as part of</font>

841
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:32,899
that policy decision here comes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mike</font>

first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say it's a great talk i'm</font>

00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,750
appeals to me as a technical asset I

847
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,369
don't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my favorite phrase to</font>

848
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,470
describe this is that the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

849
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,240
easy but the cultural culture is hard

850
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,279
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the dialogue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up</font>

851
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,259
having my policy people<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about the</font>

852
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,660
controls we put in place how do we make

853
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,210
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing than it</font>

854
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,460
is to do to the wrong thing and that's

855
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,680
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only common ground in terms</font>

856
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,660
of mindset we have in<font color="#CCCCCC"> common is here is</font>

857
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,049
our policy now what are our technical

858
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,970
controls we can put in place and I

859
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,530
struggle sometimes in trying to speak in

860
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,629
the same language and find collaborative

861
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,730
venues in that way you talk a little bit

862
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:23,339
about taking the policy what's the right

863
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,349
thing to do at how to design from there

864
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:27,180
what what is an adequate technical

865
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,349
control how much diligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

866
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,629
do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure they can't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that no</font>

867
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:32,220
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how hard they try or just enough</font>

868
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:36,690
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it more difficult than following</font>

869
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:40,098
the policy or that's a horrible question

870
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:42,780
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult to answer so</font>

871
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:44,640
because that that your question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

872
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">spot-on because that's where you spend</font>

873
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,420
most of your time when you're engaging

874
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:52,700
with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to</font>

875
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:55,079
approach this from at this mature level

876
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:58,200
how do you know what what is appropriate

877
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,990
how do you know how much effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

878
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:06,089
in place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it difficult to</font>

879
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:09,450
overcome the controls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end in my</font>

880
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:13,078
standpoint is why would the user want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

881
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:14,549
bypass the controls can you structure it

882
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,850
in such a way where you've

883
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,830
of that incentive if the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

884
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:22,319
individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to work from remote and</font>

885
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:26,549
you've provided them with an accepted in

886
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:29,070
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy-to-use method then why would</font>

887
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:30,840
they work outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it what other goal</font>

888
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,620
did you not take into account when you

889
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:37,230
designed that that initial process and

890
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:39,270
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss something maybe the</font>

891
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,430
landscape<font color="#CCCCCC"> has changed you know that</font>

892
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,440
happens you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be willing to update</font>

893
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,779
your policy possibly more than once once

894
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,190
a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to make sure you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

895
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,540
good breakdowns between what's the

896
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,580
difference between a policy a guideline

897
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,930
the standard and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth you</font>

898
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,940
have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that structured and</font>

899
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:58,169
inflexible to deal with it with the

900
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">changing landscapes but why does that</font>

901
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:05,400
user not want to work within that

902
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:09,509
structure and and when that comes up you

903
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,070
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you missed I hope I</font>

904
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope I'm answering your ear your</font>

905
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:17,580
question because the it basically comes

906
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:20,430
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah is the control one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

907
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:23,009
user could bypass possibly yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly</font>

908
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:26,129
could be trivial to bypass but why would

909
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:28,110
they and if you can if you can approach

910
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:30,270
it and build a structure where they

911
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:33,030
you've removed that why question why

912
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:36,210
would they do this then you're on your

913
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:38,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to success</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

914
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:42,980
willing to address it on a frequent

915
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,980
basis does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font>

916
00:45:48,909 --> 00:46:00,649
yeah well yeah that that's tough and you

917
00:45:55,489 --> 00:46:02,839
know part of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> um sometimes we</font>

918
00:46:00,649 --> 00:46:05,299
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these large organizations where we</font>

919
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:08,269
don't understand what these individuals

920
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:11,479
jobs what their jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are and and</font>

921
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:13,368
so how do you provide them a process

922
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:14,808
that is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to them when</font>

923
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:16,729
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even understand what they're</font>

924
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:19,429
trying to accomplish and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens</font>

925
00:46:16,729 --> 00:46:21,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">constantly and there's really no</font>

926
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:23,569
substitute to understanding to sitting

927
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:27,169
down and understanding exactly what that

928
00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:30,049
employees job is and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can I make it</font>

929
00:46:27,169 --> 00:46:32,679
easier within the policy framework so

930
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:36,979
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to work outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

931
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:38,569
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know unfortunately sometimes you</font>

932
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:41,029
have individuals that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just very</font>

933
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:42,769
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with and they're going</font>

934
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:45,769
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be obstinate just for the sake of it</font>

935
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:47,359
and in those circumstances is there

936
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,948
anyone else within the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

937
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:53,749
has a similar position that you could

938
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:56,389
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them instead and you know if</font>

939
00:46:53,749 --> 00:47:00,109
you have that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of obstacle of</font>

940
00:46:56,389 --> 00:47:01,699
an employee not to be crass but in a lot

941
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:04,029
of circumstances do they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font>

942
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:07,969
employee<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know are they making</font>

943
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:09,229
situations very difficult you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

944
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:10,909
and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're addressing</font>

945
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:13,308
these types of problems you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shake out</font>

946
00:47:10,909 --> 00:47:14,569
individuals that are not engaged as part

947
00:47:13,309 --> 00:47:17,630
of the company and then you have to

948
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:19,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">dress them from that perspective which</font>

949
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,749
is only possible if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a good</font>

950
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:24,229
champion on your side that's driving

951
00:47:20,749 --> 00:47:27,198
these but this policy discussion anyhow

952
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:28,759
so it may or may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even be something</font>

953
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,829
you can accomplish but you get as close

954
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:32,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you can which is oftentimes an</font>

955
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:36,049
improvement of where where you are and

956
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:37,339
so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as each time you address the</font>

957
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:42,639
problem you get further and further into

958
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:42,639
a good solution then it's helped

959
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:51,020
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've run into in my</font>

960
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,610
career time and time again is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

961
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,830
business is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

962
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:56,300
it's protecting them but every most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

963
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,220
all you run into these scenarios where

964
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,810
when security and business are directly

965
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:02,930
opposed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of get that sort of</font>

966
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:05,690
steel cage match going on without<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail</font>

967
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:08,540
the business always<font color="#E5E5E5"> wins and I know that</font>

968
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:10,550
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little demoralizing I'm sure</font>

969
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,500
you come across this any thoughts or

970
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,840
ideas on how when you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with that</font>

971
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,490
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the secure way goes</font>

972
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,990
completely against the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business way in</font>

973
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:21,140
the business way always<font color="#E5E5E5"> wins because the</font>

974
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:23,569
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> way makes money yeah and and</font>

975
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:26,299
that's that's a very common<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation</font>

976
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:28,130
and one that will wind up being

977
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,260
consistent once it's implemented until

978
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,940
an adverse event occurs and then you'll

979
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,310
flip back into that stage where an

980
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,740
adverse event is change is driving the

981
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:42,259
changes to policy and you'll swing too

982
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:45,259
far the other way yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

983
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:47,330
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> true that you know there's a</font>

984
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,770
reason that penetration tests work the

985
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,080
way they do you know are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

986
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:53,690
comprehensive do they identify every

987
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,460

provide a company real tangible issues

and that makes makes it seem more real

they<font color="#CCCCCC"> in business what are their drivers</font>

1001
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,410
realistically<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my perspective</font>

1002
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,540
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with doing it the</font>

00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,590
organization wants to do and this is

1005
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,540
they do it with their eyes open<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1006
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:41,540
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key is doing it with</font>

1007
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:44,330
their eyes open because people will deny

1008
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,400
the risk because again the risk adverse

1009
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:49,580
they don't want to say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> no risk</font>

1010
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,380
is acceptable lay it out make sure that

1011
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,360
they understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is that they're</font>

1012
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,840
about to implement and if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1013
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,880

1014
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,530
they will live with the consequences

1015
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,170
it's documented is their names down on

1016
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:05,710
it it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right decision because</font>

1017
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:08,380
i love the analogy of jumping out of an

1018
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:10,450
airplane is only risky if you have a

1019
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,920
parachute<font color="#E5E5E5"> on if you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

1021
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,980
there's no there's no probability of one

1022

way or the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what's going</font>

1023
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:24,400
to happen and and that's that that's the

1024
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,490
way you you have to you deal with risk

1025
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,430
is it's what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> life fun you know</font>

1026
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:34,270
there's a reason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> high risk things</font>

1027
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:35,560
are enjoyable you know and and so you

1028
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:39,000
just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your eyes open and</font>

1029
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:41,620
accept it is there another question

1030
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,930
really I was just going to say like

regarding your question like document

1035
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,500
know when sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's worth it to</font>

00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">lose a battle if it wins you the war you</font>

1041
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,390
oh well you were correct all along and

1042
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,800
now we're now we're in a you know a bit

1043
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:13,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">of trouble because of that you know we</font>

1044
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,040
didn't go with your recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1045
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,810
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to look back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1046
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,880
well this is what I said you know and

00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:21,220
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I I put in these emails</font>

my recommendations you win against them

00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:29,170
in pursuit of greater profits and now

1051
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,460
you're reaping what you sow right then

1052
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,080
you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build up that</font>

1053

credibility with your you know with your

upper management in the ownership of the

1055

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was right here you know maybe</font>

1057
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,520
maybe we'll go with his side you know

1058
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:45,990
the next time that we have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

steel cage matches like you're saying

1060
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,379
yep oh that's totally there's a reason

1061
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,558
that retreat is a perfectly valuable

of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I've come across that I</font>

1069
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:20,930
find to be very interesting is the whole

1070
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:22,630
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk compensation and it</font>

1071
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:25,489
basically goes along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lines of</font>

1072
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:27,079
individuals have a certain level of risk

1073
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:29,809
that they're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept and</font>

1074
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:31,999
they're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> engage in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activity that</font>

1075
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:35,749
meets that risk level regardless of

1076
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:37,669
anything else surrounding them and if

1077
00:52:35,749 --> 00:52:41,450
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about change control in a lot</font>

1078
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:43,819
of organizations change control is often

1079
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:46,640
referred to as<font color="#CCCCCC"> brakes brakes are</font>

performance tool on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car they're not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a safety tool they allow you to go</font>

1082
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:54,230
faster because you can stop quicker has

1083
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:56,720
nothing to a safety has to do with

1084
00:52:54,230 --> 00:53:00,019
performance same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with change</font>

1085
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,749
control change control is about building

1086
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:08,390
in the ability to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1087
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:11,660
organization in a quicker manner and so

1088
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:14,359
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really about reducing risk at</font>

1089
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,618
that point if you install antivirus on

1090
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:18,680
your system and you believe that

1091
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:22,609
antivirus actually works you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> god</font>

1092
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:25,819
help you then what you may be willing to

1093
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:27,319
download this program this random

1094
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:29,210
program you found on the internet and

1095
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:32,329
run it because you're trusting your

1096
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:35,720
antivirus is actually going to protect

1097
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:37,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you where if you didn't have antivirus</font>

1098
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,720
you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged in that</font>

1099
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:44,660
activity so are you better off are you

1100
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:47,720
more safe at that point with antivirus

1101
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:50,660
installed are you roughly the same are

1102
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you lessening the there's that's an</font>

1103
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:55,519
example there's a lot of other areas

1104
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:58,669
along this this that you have to look at

1105
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,758
and what the idea of risk compensation

1106
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:01,279
it's

1107
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:04,199
mainly driven if you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1108
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:08,279
individual by the name of John Adams out

of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UK he deals with road safety</font>

1110
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:15,989

1111
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:18,179
repeal of safety belt laws because he

feels that safety belt laws<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1113
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:22,380
make people less safe and he has a lot

<font color="#E5E5E5">of interesting commentary about that i</font>

1115
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,419
think that there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ideas and</font>

1116
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:29,519
risk compensation theory we can apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

our own organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the way we</font>

address policy the way we address risk

within the organization's it's

definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth looking at it's</font>

1121
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably would be a good basis for a</font>
