7
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,080
incident response whether it's 100 or

8
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,250
101 depends how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail we want to</font>

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,860
go into and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many questions you have</font>

10
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,170
for me if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody has questions about</font>

12
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,030
last year with the held coincidentally

13
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,619
in rooms 23 and 23 be down in San Diego

14
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,850
anyway this is from across the street

15
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,220
but those room lens I was really happy

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:32,530
to get anything at all let alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dog</font>

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:34,840
dancing in the water so sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow so my</font>

18
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,940
backstory on incident response is that I

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,770
failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's to say I did a good</font>

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,869
job when they asked me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

21
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,990
an incident response plan for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

22
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:46,239
my background is our team is governance

23
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:50,979
and security we take on some operational

24
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:53,020
rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles pardon me and do just about</font>

25
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,910
everything else that needs to be done

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">incorporation it's a specialty group</font>

27
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,550
we've got a lot of skill sets in our

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,110
group but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small group I did a</font>

29
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,910
good job preparing the incident response

30
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,649
plan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our team and now it's the</font>

31
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,728
corporate interim incident response plan

32
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:11,590
be careful what you do well yeah now I

33
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,910
get to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> up scenarios so all those</font>

34
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,610
years of playing Dungeons and Dragons

35
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,020
the GM makes me the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> who comes up</font>

36
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,319
with all the scenarios to run the whole

37
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,860
corporations you never thought that

38
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,859
would come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> handy</font>

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,390
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this would be a good</font>

40
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,040
talk amongst those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I listed as was</font>

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,109
picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> out hey this this would be a good</font>

44
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,630
now asked to do more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am hoping as</font>

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
you're moving up and proving your worth

46
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,420
to corporations that this has helped you

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,870
it's that's my intent this is a process

48
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,559
of discovery for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I've taken and built</font>

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:59,459
on the shoulder of giants as I hope is a

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:00,690
reasonable approach and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

51
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,820
I'm talking on this is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually care</font>

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,459
about the topic it's it's it's engaging

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,500

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:35,030
virtually nothing it you do need when

65
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:37,320
you instantiate your program<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk so</font>

let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through each of these in</font>

67
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,829
preparation it's not just writing out

68
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,899
the plan you've got to establish what

69
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,850
you need you have to establish your

70
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,829
expectations particularly with your

71
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,820

you're going to retain as you go through

figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually went wrong and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to know in your risk management program</font>

100

what failed and what didn't we account

for before or is that something we did

102

account for and we just need to tally

off on other things saying yeah it's

itself if it doesn't work it's too

organization you need to be able to go

to that stakeholder or stakeholders or

133

bored or whoever's giving you this

00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,360
authority and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

responsibility you're taking on is

matched with the authority if you don't

137
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,300
have a balance you're going again to

142
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,899
quickly you need to set expectations

00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,399
with your stakeholders and this is

144
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,999
before anything else comes up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:45,990
realize I need to step<font color="#CCCCCC"> back a second</font>

147
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:47,639
this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how to establish or build a</font>

148
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,540
pawn incident response when you're the

149
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,010
one

150
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,140
or within the group taking

151
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,120
responsibility for that I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into</font>

00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical detail there is no technical</font>

153
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,700
detail in the talk there is my

154
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,580
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> is setting this up i'll go</font>

155
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,310
into very lightly the actual procedures

156
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,010
you might use but i won't be detailing

157
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:11,160
them you'll need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tailor those to your</font>

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,669
preparation you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be able to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an iterative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process but</font>

until you<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce the capability for</font>

prepared you'll fail the expectations go

179
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,979
both ways it's very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only</font>

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,170
to say what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you giving me but</font>

181
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,670
identify proactively which will really

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,820
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build this relationship with</font>

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,710
giving back when we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident</font>

185
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,460
you're gonna know within 10 minutes what

186
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,599
is what we know and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we fixed or</font>

187
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,010
once we've contained the problem you're

188
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,780
going to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're gonna know</font>

189
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,400
every stage along the way and once we're

190
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,460
done you're gonna get a summary report

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:30,630
that you can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand that's</font>

192
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,098
uh oh yeah i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the comment from</font>

193
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the audience was you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font>

194
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,099
budget you're going to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's</font>

195
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,590
coming back out yeah that final report

196
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:40,860
needs to include the impact from the

197
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,050
incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the costs you expended</font>

198
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,810
under the authority you were given<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

199
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,040
drive the incident response so they're

200
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact is</font>

201
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,530
they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> even ask for the unreasonable</font>

202
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,030
in my opinion which is an estimation of

203
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:58,020
what it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened if you</font>

204
00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:01,380
didn't respond which is guess to say

205
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,240
politely but all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these sort of things</font>

206
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,810
you may need to know who and your team

207
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,310
has good skills with the books

208
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:13,050
estimating risk and responsibility ask

209
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:15,119
estimating costs financially um with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

210
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,969
executives they also really need to have

211
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,770
that feedback bring to them without

212
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,990
hopefully without them having to ask

213
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,180
both setting the expectation and

214
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,370
delivering as you get into this what

215
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,770
they're going to receive you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

216
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,110
a much stronger relationship and you'll

217
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,579
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do your job because if once</font>

218
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,710
they start having to micromanage again

219
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,300
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have too few resources to deal</font>

220
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,300
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy on your back as well as the</font>

221
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,709
incident in front of you then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

222
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,880
to create a draft plan this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of</font>

223
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,790
setting expectations with your

224
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,930
stakeholders you need to be able to say

225
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,089
here's about what we're going to do

226
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,859
don't spend all your time on this it's

227
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,020
an iterative<font color="#CCCCCC"> process give them something</font>

228
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,210
that they can identify find reasonable

229
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,880
and sign off on so that you can get your

230
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">final approval that draft plan is a good</font>

231
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start with with an architecture</font>

232
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,880
I've got several resources at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

233
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,829
the talk particularly the NIST I our

234
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,710
stuff is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good there are others</font>

235
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,180
all over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the user critical</font>

236
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,130
eye but mostly use a critical eye for

237
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,479
how can this effect and help your

238
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,980
organization identifying resources is

239
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,620
another part of that setting

240
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,500
expectations what you have what you can

241
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,610
have do you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go higher and</font>

242
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,530
spending your time on this is very

243
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,170
important when you when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this you</font>

244
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,089
can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi our bodies these every</font>

245
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,500
responder will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical in your</font>

246
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:35,310
response you need to know you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

247
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,220
somebody who has the skills necessary

248
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,520
and one of those skills is going to be

249
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:43,050
domain knowledge of your organization

250
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,089
I'll get more to that but it's it's

251
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,490
critical that that you have team members

252
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,570
you draw<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your organization even if</font>

253
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,820
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the technical or</font>

254
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:54,930
analytical skills you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

255
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,730
do that and finally you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all this in</font>

256
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,680
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your stakeholders and you're</font>

257
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,300
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to say hey here's what</font>

258
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,979
we're going to do you know we're going

259
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this happens make sure you</font>

260
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">include you're going to improve upon it</font>

261
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,170
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that puts in your claws for</font>

262
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,280
making things happen right and not to a

263
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,280
dead paper document

264
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,579
here's where I'll go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

265
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,579
questions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we'll start with that</font>

266
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:23,100
all right

267
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:30,110
a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question question was how do</font>

268
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:32,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">you define incidents within your</font>

269
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,790
organization and yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

270
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:36,170
been critical for us as well often the

271
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,139
audit people will be for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first to</font>

272
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,110
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up or well at least it was for</font>

273
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:43,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">us that's that's a very difficult task</font>

274
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,170
it's actually a question I<font color="#E5E5E5"> post back to</font>

275
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:47,479
each of you it's all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was asked</font>

276
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:51,349
which is okay what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we going to do</font>

277
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,119
what is going to happen in my opinion

278
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you cannot know and I've approached this</font>

279
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:58,429
with an architectural model where I try

280
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle all the eventualities that's I</font>

281
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:03,110
hope not<font color="#CCCCCC"> too much of a cop-out I try to</font>

282
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,479
make something that you can apply in yet

283
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,689
I I do understand your<font color="#E5E5E5"> question very</font>

284
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,610
deeply I'm afraid defining<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your</font>

285
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:13,519
incidents are is going to be important

286
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,259
for the purposes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk I'm</font>

287
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,279

information security incidents that's

everything from when<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone picks up a</font>

ream of paper that's got PII on it and

walks out the door to malware outbreaks

case is what I'm talking to and do you

296
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,889
have any more questions in detail on

297
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:43,758
that point I'm afraid I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

298
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:45,410
outline it here no okay happy to talk

<font color="#E5E5E5">after the talk on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this there's a</font>

300
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:51,910
lot of backstory so and overall yeah

301
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,910
here beside

302
00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:01,979
loading resources and

303
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:04,709
in us went through the hundred sixty one

304
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,910
rep to got from<font color="#CCCCCC"> mist and built a whole</font>

306
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:12,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar and all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I find that that</font>

307
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:13,679
the things that need to be done and the

308
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,139
people that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there there's a gap and</font>

309
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,449
so have you found a way to front-load or

310
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,889
push into your plan that these positions

311
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:21,540
need to be filled and you need these

312
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,279
resources and then bring it forward so

313
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,480
that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fill that or are</font>

314
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to make do with what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

315
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,809
have yes we did take that into account

316
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,639
one word consultants I'll get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

317
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:35,399
when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more into the resources but</font>

318
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,980
if as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of setting your expectations</font>

319
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,230
you need to establish where you'll need

320
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,360
consultants you won't have a database

321
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,920
forensics guy who's got 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

322
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,689
experience on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> team unless you're a</font>

323
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">very large corporation or government</font>

324
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:53,699
agency and then you might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

325
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:55,559
so I'm sorry just one quickie with

326
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:58,589
regards to gathering information do you

327
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,118
recommend using a wiki and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how</font>

328
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:04,110
much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information should really</font>

329
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:05,970
be confidential your incident response

330
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,919
plan and overall architecture shouldn't

331
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,360
necessarily be confidential when you're

332
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">handling an incident you actually do</font>

333
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,769
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to operate on a need-to-know basis</font>

334
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:16,319
let me I believe you mean when you're

335
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:23,970
using a wiki for in the process of

336
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:25,829
incident response then let me get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

337
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,290
little further on but the short answer

338
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:30,779
is I don't I would not use<font color="#CCCCCC"> an automated</font>

339
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">process as the front end for your</font>

340
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:35,970
Incident Response program in the one we

341
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,339
formed we want we rely on several key

342
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,739
roles people who make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

343
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">front-end the process in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case that</font>

344
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:45,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be the incident response manager</font>

345
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,790
or coordinator who would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

346
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,540
up to date on what's going on

347
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,449
communicate it to them through whatever

348
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,488
necessary channel is to be used or not

349
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:56,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it is a sensitive issue</font>

350
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:58,799
and bringing that in bringing them in

351
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:01,129
that way managing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

352
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,129
question

353
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:10,850
system for managing the incidents we

354
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,589
found it very useful with the incident

355
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,160
manager making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure your information</font>

356
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:19,040
gets put in there and then because we're

357
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,319
human will forget things but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

358
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,139
data mining that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> making correlations</font>

359
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to different ip's different domains and</font>

360
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:29,269
so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we didn't actually</font>

361
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,799
initially see<font color="#E5E5E5"> during our analysis so it</font>

362
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:32,419
did help putting it all it together and

363
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">then being able to run some scripts and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the based on your question the places</font>

366
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:44,239
I've been to we had our wiki basically

367
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,220
separated from anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else on the</font>

368
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:48,439
network within our incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> management</font>

369
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,359
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our war room as it were and</font>

370
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,858
didn't have anywhere outside so we

371
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:53,899
didn't worry didn't necessarily need to

372
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:55,220
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> any confidentiality issues</font>

373
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:56,329
or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that sense because the</font>

374
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,269
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that were allowed in that</font>

375
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:01,419
room where the incident team and the

376
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:05,600
handful of folks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were supporting us</font>

377
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:07,609
that's a bit like how we approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I'm</font>

378
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,220
a little architecture agnostic in this i

379
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:12,249
would suggest strongly suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

380
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,489
move toward automation and

381
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:17,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">record-keeping in the incident response</font>

382
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:19,309
because yes that's if you aren't

383
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,230
recording what's going on you won't be

384
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,899
able to do proper resolution and

385
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:32,839
evaluates are on our IR plan once you've

386
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:35,569
formed it once you've used it yeah the

387
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,819
IRT may eventually find an incident

388
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:40,069
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are they are affected more</font>

389
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:41,769
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely it will be the email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font>

00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:44,419
doesn't work phone systems are down

393
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:53,509
center whatever that might be but yeah

394
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:56,319
you also need a backup failover paper

395
00:16:53,509 --> 00:17:00,529
process and when developing your plan

396
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:02,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should make those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to match I'm</font>

397
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:06,230
stealing from all of my later slides but

398
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:09,470
it's I was I very gleefully pulled our

399
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> response archived documents the</font>

400
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,829
key data that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to record in</font>

401
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,399
each phase and let me get starting to

402
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen after they</font>

403
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,980
us where the archived documents the

404
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,960
paper process is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually what we will</font>

405
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,360
capture in a real incident response and

406
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,100
they look the same as our litigation

407
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,379
support process because we had

408
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,149
well-established well ironed out mature

409
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,460
process we already that everyone on our

410
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,500
team already knew so we're leveraging

411
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,530
not only something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes me five</font>

412
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,240
minutes to steal but also everybody else

413
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,730
who already knows it can come in as a

414
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,610
responder and<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize oh this is where</font>

415
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,290
we are this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do you</font>

416
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,570
get leverage in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

417
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,300
in the people's minds who are helping

418
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,800
you with your spots by making things

419
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,879
correlate between one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those things</font>

420
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,560
they already now and you get the

421
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,950
additional responsive actually as

422
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,990
solidifying a perhaps not as often<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

423
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,090
process that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do know they can go</font>

424
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to in this case litigation respond</font>

425
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,290
a litigation support and say oh yeah I

426
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,090
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I where I met or I'm here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

427
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:13,180
because they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> did three incidents</font>

428
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:16,340
hopefully not but maybe so in my model

429
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:21,440
we've got preparation I think I'm almost

430
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:23,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">done beating it now I'm not if you're</font>

you're you're at your preparation you've

432
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,160
got to get everything ironed out first

433
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">pardon me</font>

triage his term I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> terribly happy</font>

435
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:44,580
with comes from the necessity to

436
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,280
establish those who are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die</font>

anyway those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are dying who you can</font>

438
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,940
save and those who aren't going to die

439
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:57,210
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use it it's not really completely</font>

440
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,700
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> analogue to what's going on but</font>

441
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,590
you need to identify first when you're

442
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">going into your incident response is</font>

443
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,250
this an incident or it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just another</font>

444
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,750

451
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,539
question is asked to and how you do all

452
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">the communication up to that person for</font>

security issue is it a security incident

455
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,130
because at that point you also have to

456
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">take it you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the curtain and</font>

457
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,159
say okay yeah we'll fix it don't worry

458
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:44,158
shut up please we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

459
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:47,370
problem containment is your first real

00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:51,240
phase this is this triage containment

461
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouser and containment are the</font>

462
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,350
emergency phases this is when you are

463
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:58,559
scrambling to understand the problem

464
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:02,549
communicate what you know and containing

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,500
the incident stopping whatever badness

466
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:10,860
is happening from becoming more bad

467
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:12,960
because badness is bad you need to you

468
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,209
know do whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

471
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,740
limiting the scope of the impact at hand

472

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad things that are going on</font>

they all address a very specific need

475
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,090
and you have to continue to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards</font>

that need before you move on if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

is it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our firewall rules were</font>

may do that later in resolution but the

505
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:42,690
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do we fix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and that</font>

may end up spinning up a program pardon

507
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,309
me a project to do so identify with the

508
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,710
proper groups where you need to go from

509
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix this once you've already</font>

510
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,739
contain the problem the overall

511
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,989
resolution is once you've resolved the

512
00:21:55,739 --> 00:22:01,019
issue you do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach and</font>

513
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:03,899
discuss the overall problem if you've

514
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,340
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor management controls on changes</font>

515
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:07,830
and your change management process is

516
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,019
actually faulty you need to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

517
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,668
identify that not necessarily fix it

518
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,019
when you're talking about the core

519
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:14,639
issues you're usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about an</font>

520
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:16,409
expansion of scope that's well beyond

521
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:18,119
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may be chartered for for</font>

522
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:19,619
incident response you're not responding

00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the incident anymore but you are</font>

524
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:24,359
describing its cause and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as</font>

525
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,950
important as containing it often because

526
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,039
you'll be containing it for all future

527
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,570
incidents you need to be able to

528
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,100
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

529
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,230
stakeholders not just the people who

530
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,199
have sponsored you but to the impacted

531
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,960
parties so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> know hey you're doing</font>

532
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">your job somebody's thinking about not</font>

533
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,139
just what just happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> but not having</font>

534
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">it happen again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're going to</font>

535
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:47,580
be leery of the whole topic of whatever

00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:50,399
it process personnel or infrastructure

537
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,869
just failed you given you have a given

538
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:54,389
confidence in that again so they can

539
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:57,230
build on it when you've fixed it to go

540
00:22:54,389 --> 00:23:00,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">on with business go on with life</font>

541
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,400
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get that also out to</font>

542
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,780
those who may actually be charged with

543

fixing the problem they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:09,270
sign off however you motivate those

546
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:11,909
people to do it whether it's a political

547
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,379
or a directive or simply guidance that

548
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:17,100
your group signs off on in hopes that

549
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:21,090
somebody does a good job resolution is

550
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:23,399
also where you evaluate your plan was

551
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:26,370
your plan successful where did you have

552
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,740
hiccups you will the most mistakes will

553
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,510
happen in an incident response even a

554
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,919
well-prepared one because people are

555
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:36,390
woken up at 3am and on the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,120
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to record them and it shouldn't</font>

564
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:56,610
be held in as an indictment against

those responders those subject matter

passing off drafts you know it requests

578
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,239
maybe it doesn't go in the final report

579
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,980
maybe it does but you've got to

580
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,200
communicate through that if it's an

581
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,450
informal means of doing that that works

582
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:33,210
too but it really is a requirement there

583
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:35,070
and you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel to fix your your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">own process if you didn't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a back-up</font>

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,510
plan for this that or the other thing

586
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,039
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with one take what you've</font>

587
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:44,309
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> got and make it redundant</font>

588

589
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:48,240
on a different technology different

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,309
medium different connectivity whatever

591
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:56,190
you need their tie up your loose ends

592
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:59,280
and move on this is a big one the first

593
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,320
point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles are not people this will</font>

594
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:05,010
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to resource management too but you</font>

595
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,200
can't say this is Bob he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your</font>

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:09,230
incident response plan Bob just got me

597
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,100
hit by a bus you now have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> incident</font>

598
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,400
yeah

599
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,629
and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify that rolls</font>

600
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,230
have to be maintained as I mean the the

601
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,880
responsibilities were all have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

maintained and acted upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> by people who</font>

603
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,360
are capable to doing it you have to

604
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,210
staff to your roles not the other way

605
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,709
around don't just throw the person under

606
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bus who's really good at everything</font>

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,450
and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think well on the</font>

610
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,649
fly they can they're definitely the

611
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,780
right person having your response group

612
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,360
really a good subject matter expert

613
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,299
perfect for using as a resource and

614
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,510
putting it a console but if they can't

615
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:50,730
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this controller fails</font>

616
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,408
we're looking at a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the other</font>

617
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,020
three environments just like this and

627
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,100
match what the business requirements are

what your objective response is going to

629
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,570
be if you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy application</font>

it's stopping business because any

further operations would be more

detrimental to the company than

677

otherwise or telling the execs that

678
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,070
that's what needs to happen depending on

679

how much authority they're given they

680
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,800
are the ones who make the authority

calls and use the big stick when

682
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,899
necessary they're the ones who really

683
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,699
run the show and they can't be the ones

684
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,680
at the console in fact neither the

685

coordinator or the manager<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be the</font>

ones at the console that cannot be

688
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,560
executives we're going to be clawing at

need your<font color="#CCCCCC"> help and here's why when they</font>

727
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:08,020
asked not if and you can't do that it's

731
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,059
what do we do when something goes well

732
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,230
beyond the responsibilities and

737
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:29,709
this but a response has to take politics

738
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,410
aside because we're really talking about

739
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:39,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">heart high and set high costs to the</font>

litigation support we're not a large

788
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,630
we do them effectively because when we

789
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,370
have a problem that we know our

790
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,890
resources can't match we call the

791
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,449
consultants I know there are mixed

792
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,800
feelings about help what consultants can

something you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well let me know</font>

796
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,360
it's that you need to be able to call

797
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,100
those people and get them where they

798
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,330
need to be as soon as possible and you

799
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:53,620
already have to have those those roles

800

the resource manage it well it's not

819
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,010
just about driving to containment of

820
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,810
course that's it but if at the end of

821
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,450
the day everyone goes home you've got

822
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:48,669
you know a five by eight shop and the

823
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:51,880
incident effectively stops mitigation

824
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:53,920
and you've got two of them going on pull

825

support from one if it's not going to

working on that specific incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

977
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:05,450
depends on the issue that's an easy one

that's a call if it if it isn't directly

it needs to be you know taken care of

995
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:44,880
done done a good job of just identifying

1002
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,000
is don't idly chat you need that time

1003
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:07,410
anyway it should be obvious about

1004
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,630
chatting around the water cooler is not

1005
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:15,180
a good idea keep it to the offices and

1006
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,500
you know keep that information under

1007
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,020
wraps because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">had an incident to deal with and I had</font>

to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular systems</font>

day fedex him overnight pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple we</font>

1017
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,618
do that on occasion and he seemed

1018
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,839
somehow reticent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

1019
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:50,400
phone and sit and I said okay well if we

1020
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,529
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done he's like why well</font>

1021
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,870
I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really discuss the matter with</font>

1022
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see those those things</font>

1023
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:59,029
done we've got the approval we've

1024
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,350
notified the IT<font color="#CCCCCC"> director</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT manager</font>

1025
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:06,120
you're the direct report that's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1026
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:08,009
it works is like well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones my wife yeah</font>

1027
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,170
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get hit with stuff like</font>

1028
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,820
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really know if there is</font>

1029
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,730
a good way to handle the situation at

1030
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,100
that point but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen and</font>

1031
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,900
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sensitive to it I don't</font>

1032
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,240
know if it was discussed and luckily for

1033
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,670
us actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidentially the</font>

1034
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,870
confidentiality in that situation turned

1035
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,210
out not to be important which was a

1036
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:29,520
great relief but you've got to be very

1037
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:32,520
careful with<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you how you communicate</font>

1038
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:43,980
both as widely as necessary and as

1039
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:46,020
tightly as needed I'm sorry question to

1040
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,510
expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your point even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some</font>

1041
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,480
managers you have to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful oh</font>

1042
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,400
definitely with what you tell them

1043
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,670
definitely mark on the individual who

1044
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,200
asked a question earlier in our incident

1045
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:01,140
management process we have what we call

1046
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,790
a hot wash so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the end of it for</font>

1047
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,799
some of our bigger incidents we get

1048
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">people together and give them a briefing</font>

1049
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll we'll clean it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up so that it</font>

1050
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,370
doesn't mention people's names server

1051
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,870
names IP addresses or anything epic just

1052
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:15,390
kind of give them the whole overview of

1053
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:17,490
this is what happened this is why it

1054
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:19,529
happened and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the steps we need</font>

1055
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:22,020
to take to prevent it from happening in

1056
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,280
the future I'd agree and I'd even<font color="#E5E5E5"> add to</font>

1057
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,650
their briefing you might want to include

1058
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,300
where things shouldn't be discussed

1059
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:29,490
these are legal matters at this point

1060
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually if you say this is a legal</font>

1061
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,299
or HR<font color="#CCCCCC"> mad matter managers know their</font>

1062
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,220
asses on the line if they do discuss it

1063
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:40,620
at least in those circles in which I

1064
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:43,529
work so I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> a maturity model</font>

1065
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:46,350
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many out there I use this one</font>

00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:48,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">five steps ten steps three steps as</font>

1067
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:51,000
simple is not a bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing informal</font>

1068
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:53,819
that's where you are now if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1069
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,680
know if you don't know you are that<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font>

1070
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,090
don't be that guy that guy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">regulator's right up on their reports</font>

1072
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:00,770
you get fired if it's very

1073
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,260
responsibility to do incident response

1074
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:06,420
that's a that's it you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be</font>

1075
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy it's it's not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

1076
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:12,290
funny documented is the dead tree

1077
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:14,670
approach the war on trees continues

1078
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,840
that's where you come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with it you</font>

1079
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,130
print it out you maybe put it on a

1080
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,450
website and say these are policy

1081
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,760
documents here's the incident response

1082
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:23,189
plan no one reads it everyone signs off

1083
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,370
on it blindly um you have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1084
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:27,660
first though iron it out get it set get

1085
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:30,029
it set in a format where you can make

1086
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes because you will you absolutely</font>

1087
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:34,740
will it'll be too general to specific

1088
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:38,000
not handle all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> situations you</font>

1089
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:39,899
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind when you outlined it</font>

1090
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,260
established is where you're really

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,970
actually using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you've you've gotten</font>

your buy-in from your executives our

1093
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,470
sponsors say go you've documented it

1094
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,820
you've got it all signed off you

1095
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:54,839
actually have incident response

1096

1099
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:07,790
though you will be tested anyway and you

1100
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,680
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that eventuality</font>

1101
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:13,110
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test on a regular basis</font>

1102
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,080
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this your</font>

allow incidents to take the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

even the notes you're taking for how you

1123
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:05,549
do incident response will be oh you're

1124
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,200
not going to get twenty percent of the

1125
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,760
value when you're doing a test that's

1126
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,810
where you get a lot of that value and

1127
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,680
that's how you make sure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

um you will be tested under fire you

1130
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,970
don't want to always be tested under

1131
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,470
fire because you won't know everyone

1132
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:25,680
will literally have their nose in the

1141
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,710
don't affect your group this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1142
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,260
save you time make you more effective

1143
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:57,360
make you to do better to do standard

1144
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,420
delivery that's going to help you an

1145
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,490
immense amount and it helps codify your

1146
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,050
process it helps establish the process

1147
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,549
people who come in can go through a

1148
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,830
training module in that process perhaps

1149
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:11,220
and come onto<font color="#CCCCCC"> the team quickly easily</font>

1150
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:13,440
and able to come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do and deliver the</font>

1151
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,060
last phase is of course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Holy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Grail I</font>

1152
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,970
hope you get there that's amateur

1153
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:19,350
process when you've acculturated the the

1154
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,870
process people when you pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:23,520
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe even recognize your voice</font>

1156
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:25,650
and they know if you're calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> them at</font>

1157
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,680
3am they better go get a cup of coffee

1158
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:30,180
if they have time that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1159
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,339
you here talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your last</font>

incident response scenario in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the break</font>

1161
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,150
room not just the break room for your

00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,730

you're fixing a problem that's going to

00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise slap them a little harder</font>

00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:01,590
upside the head move through those oh

1174
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,060
and another note on<font color="#E5E5E5"> these I did spend</font>

00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:05,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">some time this may seem like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

1176
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,490
simple list but if you don't achieve

1177
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:11,430
each in sequence you will have huge gaps

1178
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:13,109
if you don't have a tested process your

1179

integrated solution that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pay</font>

1181
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:19,110
develop it's going to have so many flaws

1182
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:20,910
it'll be useless test it work it out

1183
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:23,340
first make sure you really get the

1184
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:25,290
exercise in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> break up the stuff</font>

1185
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,040
that might be holding it back simplify

1186
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:32,580
wherever

1187
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:35,310
possible and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have for you at the</font>

1190
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:45,180
reverse that what I mean when I say

1193
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,379
or when you're doing your response if

1194
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,790
you're in containment your job isn't to

1195
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,330
worry about how you're going to fix it

1196
00:48:53,790 --> 00:49:00,540
later stop the stop the damage now stop

1197
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:02,930
the potential for damage now stop the

1198
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:06,180
potential for future damage later

1199
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:08,790
contain the problem at hand the

1200
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:14,399
resolution work to fix the problem that

1201
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:16,050
let it happen I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this</font>

1202
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I memorized it but then I have a</font>

1203
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:26,520
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh that's a good</font>

1204
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:29,270
point why was it again yeah chaperone

1205
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the prac plan as well it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1206
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,670
you're going to be focused on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1207
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:36,090
thing you're doing when you're doing it

1208
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,950
but recognize when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're incident</font>

1209
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,590
coordinator perhaps is treating this as

1210
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:41,819
a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> checkboxes and they're kind of</font>

1211
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,200
tired they don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there that</font>

1212
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">day they're looking to vacation in the</font>

1213
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,830
next week it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list to check boxes</font>

1214
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,510
keep them focused on why they're doing

1215
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:50,310
it and recognize what they're putting

1216
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,750
into it get them energized about how

1217
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:54,990
they're helping it if you make this an

1218
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,970
iterative positive process you you

1219
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:58,709
hopefully will motivate people to see

1220
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:01,770
the change they can affect on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1221
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:03,840
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and draw from that a little</font>

1222
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:06,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit about my history my background I</font>

1223
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,950
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you know global 1000</font>

1224
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,380
consulting and do pen tests all day long

1225
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:14,549
and I got started<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that in the first</font>

1226
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:16,170
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> or six were a blast I was breaking</font>

1227
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">into corporate networks taking out</font>

1228
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:21,420
credit card numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> route accounts wow</font>

1229
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:26,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you go through a few more it's</font>

1230
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:29,250
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of scary 10 or 12 in</font>

1231
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:30,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going oh man and you go past that</font>

1232
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,750
you realize everybody's got the same

1233
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:35,820
problems they're all failing in the same

1234
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,110
way and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> started doing this I</font>

1235
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,490
shouldn't be this successful what's the

1236
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,099
problem here now this was maybe a decade

1237
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">or so</font>

1238
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:43,390
it's hopefully improved a little sense

1239
00:50:41,259 --> 00:50:46,359
then I got out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that destructive I'm</font>

1240
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:48,249
sorry I'm undressing my point is I got

1241
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:50,470
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that destructive attack only</font>

1242
00:50:48,249 --> 00:50:52,598
mindset because I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see not just</font>

1243
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:55,689
my career grow and night by cheque book

1244
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:58,509
account grow but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the</font>

1245
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:00,970
things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped have input to where I</font>

1246
00:50:58,509 --> 00:51:04,180
turn in a pen test I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid I see a</font>

1247
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:06,069
pen test is a political tool that's a

1248
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:09,788
sales tool because it shows them you got

1249
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:11,319
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey you got mail it's a tool to</font>

1250
00:51:09,789 --> 00:51:15,369
get the consultants to sell them more

1251
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:17,349
services you want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real threat</font>

1252
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:20,109
throughout now so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really getting off</font>

1253
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:21,759
the side I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see where the input</font>

1254
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:22,989
i have wasn't just ignored or didn't go

1255
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:25,450
into a black hole<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to see it</font>

1256
00:51:22,989 --> 00:51:28,390
built get your guys to help build the

1257
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:30,970
process build the program and focus on

1258
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:33,729
why they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things and it is not</font>

1259
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:36,819
all about you after that last tirade

1260

your plan either if you don't finish and

00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:49,210
work to completion on each of these your

00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:51,789
your response is not complete and

1291
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:52,900
finally reuse the stuff that works not

1292
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:55,090
just

1293
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,230
stealing process documents are pulling

you here maybe your dr guys know a thing

good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea first not to come up with a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are the one who's got responsibility for</font>

incident response in your corporation

1364
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:43,650
and that plan doesn't fit the need it's

1365
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,359
the wrong plan or if it does fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1366
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:47,160
need but not for every subject matter

00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,779
experts come up with just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list of the</font>

1369
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:53,849
their training package or familiarity

on at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the week when they sign</font>

1372
00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:58,769
off of it and do a quick test on the

1373
00:55:56,279 --> 00:56:00,779
wiki whatever it is make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fits</font>

preparation pays off it's eighty percent

00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,989
of the benefit it's fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and I measure that by financial by the</font>

way your response is going to cost a lot

<font color="#E5E5E5">of money your preparation is going to</font>

preparation phase to your previous

previous question and you had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1385
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:25,140
too so one of the when your list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:32,848
you only listed internal folks largely

00:56:30,269 --> 00:56:35,488
yes building relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

1390
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:36,989
multitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> of external agencies if you're</font>

talking about local law enforcement or

00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:41,910
this sort of thing first is unlikely to

1393

be your task<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you are the person</font>

to be given the authority unless you

00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:53,190
build it over years and in respect from

1398

your sponsors to directly contact law

1399
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:57,119
enforcement it'll be a lawyer's job to

1400
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:00,089
make that call you make a summary to

1401
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,619
them and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's chief counsel maybe</font>

1402
00:57:00,089 --> 00:57:03,599
it's the HR counsel maybe it's your

<font color="#E5E5E5">already know him from you know last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6-8</font>

1417
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">months it works to your favor and</font>

1418
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:44,810
coordinating and working these sort of

1419
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,220
stuff out then Bob's agent Portsmouth

1420
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:50,450
walking in taking your server and

1421
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:52,790
walking out I don't quite agree here

1422
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:56,000
based on some experience let me lay it

1423
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:57,680
out for you I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a situation not</font>

1424
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,110
necessarily in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company in which I</font>

1425
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,509
work where someone did have a very good

1426
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:04,850
relationship with local PD and they had

1427
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:07,430
a guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was absolutely gunning great</font>

1428
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:09,319
guy wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do digital forensics he</font>

1429
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:12,549
stepped all over the FBI took a server

1430
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,550
and ruined the chain of<font color="#E5E5E5"> custody I</font>

1431
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:19,339
understand my point is the call wasn't

1432
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:21,379
made at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> incident responder level it</font>

1433
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,940
was not made by a lawyer it wasn't made

1434
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:26,720
by somebody who say that might not be a

1435
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:30,820
good idea don't come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here the call</font>

1436
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:33,560
was made by if I remember correctly

1437
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:34,760
local business management who really

1438
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,770
weren't empowered to make that level of

1439
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,960
decision and it botched chain of custody

1440
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:41,060
and really costs a lot of problems there

1441
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,940
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that they didn't</font>

1442
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:45,799
follow their their incident management

1443
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:48,230
yes or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> was established in</font>

1444
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,900
proper process it's the example I have

1445
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:54,170
it doesn't perfectly match the question

1446
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,550
you posed I recognize that but yes

1447
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:58,670
definitely where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build those</font>

1448
00:58:55,550 --> 00:59:01,760
relationships from my purposes for our

1449
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:05,030
corporation we had I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it would be</font>

1450
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,100
more cost than it was benefiting us

1451
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:09,260
because we are where we happen to be

1452
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,060
nationwide<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're brick and mortar and I</font>

1453
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:12,260
would have to know the context<font color="#CCCCCC"> for every</font>

1454
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:14,810
FBI office

1455
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:22,400
a very resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost low a little low</font>

1456
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:23,720
return<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing these in these cases but</font>

1457
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,060
more informally there's a lot of value

1458
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,379
in knowing your local FBI guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I founded</font>

1459
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,029
in Seattle they'll talk to you about

1460
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,500
hypotheticals so you know what's

1461
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,940
involved before you formally call them

1462
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,590
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and that's part of building</font>

1463
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,240
relationship and knowing who they are I

1464
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:36,800
knowing what the impact is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1465
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:40,009
of making sacramental case rather than

1466
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:42,590
just an intimate yeah to my experience

1467
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:45,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the regulatory side and all the</font>

1468
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:48,650
different regulatory bodies are

1469
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:50,410
significantly disjoint from the response

1470
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:53,360
side with local federal law enforcement

1471
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:55,759
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want this not much correlation</font>

1472
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,400
question yeah so you actually mentioned

1473
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,950
it a couple times in<font color="#CCCCCC"> passing but I think</font>

1474
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:04,040
it's something that's very key training

1475
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:05,569
yes you've you actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1476
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,279
important in your documentation face not

1477
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just document the stuff and put it up</font>

1478
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,420
you actually have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

1479
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:13,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">people need to use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information are</font>

1480
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:17,270
required to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> some training or</font>

1481
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:18,770
required to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> its you know maybe</font>

1482
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:20,390
do a test something like that because

1483
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,770
when it's three in the morning they

1484
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,120
don't know what the hell's going on no

1485
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:25,070
yeah there's no time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a book I</font>

1486
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,230
completely agree every time i've

1487
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:28,700
mentioned skill sets it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1488
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:31,730
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> select individuals in your</font>

1489
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,290
response team who can act and act right

1490
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:36,890
then and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to scale</font>

1491
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:38,690
them up now you did you do if it means

1492
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:40,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it was a training budget as part of</font>

1493
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:43,010
incident response and you've got that

1494
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:44,450
that authority make it part it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1495
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility as well and you'll be</font>

1496
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,750
expected to deliver did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see another</font>

1497
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,360
