1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,440
hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being here on</font>

2
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,890
Sunday in the morning was hard for me

3
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,769
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm here to talk about</font>

4
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,850
computation modeling today it's

5
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,400
interesting I think it's a pretty

6
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:08,620
different topic than you guys probably

7
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,270
heard being here it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

8
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,820
you know abstract and different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

9
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,310
concepts but a it relates to IT a lot

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:19,850
you know and what I'm an analyst what I

11
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,530
do you know I'm doing IT stuff a lot of

12
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,550
the time so anyway dive into the details

13
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,550
and you guys will<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to see</font>

14
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:40,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so like I said I'm an analyst</font>

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:45,700
and you know I've done modeling in a lot

16
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:47,659
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scenarios and it's a</font>

17
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,820
becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know more and more</font>

18
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:56,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">important skill and you know a tool</font>

19
00:01:52,820 --> 00:02:00,949
that's being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have experience in</font>

20
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:04,549
financial world in bioengineering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

21
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,590
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing directly where I've</font>

22
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,769
done modeling and you know like I said

23
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,810
it really interventions with<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT a lot so</font>

24
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:15,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">as I go through some examples you guys</font>

25
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,330
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to see that so first I kind</font>

26
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,030
of want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just begin with a a broad</font>

27
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:23,840
overview what<font color="#E5E5E5"> models are and kind of how</font>

28
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,360
they work is I see them first case would

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,290
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like statistical models where you're</font>

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,739
taking you know one dependent variable

31
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:36,980
and a number of other variables<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

32
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:40,760
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those other</font>

33
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,828
variables to describe a dependent

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,480
variable and you're generally doing it

35
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,549
based on data that you have large

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,060
datasets small data sets whatever it may

37
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:51,859
be and then the converse would be a

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,450
theoretical model where you're more you

39
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:56,239
have an underlying intuition and you

40
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,190
understand how things work and it's

41
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,989
giving you outputs that are based on

42
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,840
that relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you understand</font>

43
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,000
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I divide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them pretty</font>

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,319
narrowly but you know there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,470
real world there's a lot of overlap

46
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,940
between the two so go into a couple

47
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:17,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">examples so here's one example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

48
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,940
thought was somewhat insightful if you

49
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,519
were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> running off a statistical</font>

50
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,760
model you look at some data like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

51
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:30,380
which is home prices over the past

52
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,590
couple years or 15 years you know you

53
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,660
might see something like price you see

54
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,459
how prices upward trending and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

55
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,380
you know make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumption that it's</font>

56
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue to move up if you only</font>

57
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,549
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it from a statistical point of</font>

58
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,980
view and having a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a</font>

59
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:47,450
theoretical point of view you could look

60
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,429
at something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

61
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,549
price<font color="#CCCCCC"> per income and say you know</font>

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,739
eventually things are going to bottom

63
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,959
out it can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really continue in that</font>

64
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,390
trajectory because people can only

65
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,470
afford such a house price given<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

66
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,359
income so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this was just a</font>

67
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:08,019
simple example I thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,170
know you could use just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see where</font>

69
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:13,970
theoretical models are giving you some

70
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,060
intuition when a statistical model can

71
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,570
actually fail so it's just good to

72
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:24,919
understand that and then I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

73
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,630
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then this is something</font>

74
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,659
where they kind of wind up being the

75
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">same thing so here we're looking at</font>

76
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,430
carbon dioxide concentration and

77
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,080
temperature you know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

78
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,970
all these data points<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are you know</font>

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,409
you're obviously reading the amount of

80
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,000
carbon<font color="#CCCCCC"> dioxide in the temperature you</font>

81
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see there's a there's an upward</font>

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,870
trend it's pretty obvious so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,639
not not too hard to see and I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

84
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,169
in this case your theoretical

85
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,800
understanding and your statistical

86
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:56,330
understanding coincide so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a case</font>

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,750
where they kind of are one in the same

88
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,370
or they turn out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one of the same</font>

89
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,639
so anyway like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was just a</font>

90
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,100
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a brief overview so I'm going to</font>

91
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,139
go through a couple more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-depth</font>

92
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,260
examples with you know things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

93
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,940
dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and at any point if you guys</font>

94
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,830
have any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you know something</font>

95
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,219
looks strange or I'm moving a little too

96
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:23,990
quickly let me know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here to</font>

97
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,979
teach this to you guys too so one place

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,520
where I've worked as in the

99
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:31,760
computational finance an obvious one is

100
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,919
portfolio theory where basically you

101
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,099
have a set of securities that your firm

102
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,719
owns however<font color="#E5E5E5"> much money they manage</font>

103
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:41,120
whatever you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> however you divide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

104
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,530
up whether it's by a count or particular

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,160
investment strategy that they're using

106
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you know they generally make a</font>

107
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,500
purchase of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of securities and</font>

108
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,919
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to optimize for return</font>

109
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,289
and minimize risk for whomever your

110
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,740
investment whoever you're investing for

111
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,099
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge information problem to</font>

112
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,370
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

113
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:07,400
to process this information and really

114
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,600
see how things are working so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font>

115
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,549
said at the bottom here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,610
requires sophisticated information

117
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,470
capability you constantly collecting new

118
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,500
data and you have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who need to</font>

119
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,490
quickly react to the markets so you know

120
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,110
there's there's a lot of different

121
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">components here's getting the data</font>

122
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:27,110
having models that interpret it and

123
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,520
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and as we all know</font>

124
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:33,560
today things are changing pretty quickly

125
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:36,740
so here is you know a graph of kind of

126
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking about this is</font>

127
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:44,270
obviously an ideal case but just give

128
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:47,320
you a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a visual insight so you</font>

129
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,840
know this grayish greenish area there is

130
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,640
your set of investment opportunities so

131
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,679
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be all the securities you</font>

132
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,830
have available to you and you're going

133
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make some decision on how much you</font>

134
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,640
know you know what securities you're

135
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,700
actually buying and the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk</font>

136
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">and return that you're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

137
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,570
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to actually get in your</font>

138
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,610
investment strategy so you know you need

139
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,610
to have good<font color="#E5E5E5"> information capability to</font>

140
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,220
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that and to actually you</font>

141
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">know make that decision and most these</font>

142
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,360
numbers are based on historical data

143
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,580
obviously so when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

144
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,080
let's say you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty twenty</font>

145
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,840
different securities whether their bonds

146
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,150
or stocks you're going to be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

147
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,000
kind of how they've reacted historically

148
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,320
so that's that's how a lot of these

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,790
numbers have come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

150
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,560
to go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> too much detail there but I</font>

151
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,750
mean you're coming up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,510
standard deviation which approximates

153
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,000
risk you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying the return</font>

154
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the security over a two-year period</font>

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,010
you know how much has it changed things

156
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,020
like that so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are very</font>

157
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,710
useful but all with a grain of salt of

158
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:01,460
course another place where its uses risk

159
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:04,039
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that would be you know</font>

160
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,820
looking at you know based on the

161
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,740
securities that you currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> own if</font>

162
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,570
things completely tanked I mean how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

163
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,430
how much how bad could things guess

164
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,210
that's that's like what I've called

165
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,720
stressed

166
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:20,120
testing here so you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you a</font>

167
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,280
way to quantify risk to actually

168
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,620
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much money you could</font>

169
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly lose right in worst-case</font>

170
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,370
scenarios which you know people are

171
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">always trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it's hard to do</font>

172
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,779
accurately different securities have

173
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,899
different numbers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

174
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:38,838
important so in the stock market world

175
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:41,208
obviously that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sp500 is important for</font>

176
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">fixed income like bonds and corporate</font>

177
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,560
bonds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other other securities like</font>

178
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,910
that interest rates are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

179
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,640
so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at different things in</font>

180
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:54,800
different places but you know the

181
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:57,670
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is the same so you'll have</font>

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,839
some type of model in this case which is

183
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,560
basically going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a number of</font>

184
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,910
inputs and give you you know a value for

185
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,149
whatever your security is a group of

186
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,410
securities it could input any number of

187
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,860
things up here I have you know

188
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,899
unemployment GDP growth wage growth

189
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,390
inflation interest rate exchange rate

190
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,370
Simon could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be anything really and then</font>

191
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,810
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to look at how</font>

192
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,520
these VAT you know if these values go up

193
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,349
or down how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it going to affect the</font>

194
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,439
value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your securities or your group</font>

195
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,329
of securities and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the a</font>

196
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,730
lot of these extreme cases which would

197
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:34,939
be you know for most of these where

198
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,940
things are on the down so for instance

199
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,839
if unemployment rises you're going to

200
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,610
have secured<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value of your</font>

201
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,709
securities could be hurt depending on

202
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,270
what they are or a good example would be

203
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:47,569
interest rates you know interest rates

204
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,310
and bond prices move opposite so you

205
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,589
look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when interest rates</font>

206
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,329
come down or when interest rates go go

207
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,959
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> how is that going to fetch your</font>

208
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:59,660
prices so you know this is these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

209
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,270
important things and people make pretty

210
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,649
big decisions based on what these models

211
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,029
say so important and like I said I'm

212
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to tie it back to all you guys</font>

213
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:14,930
here which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a big big</font>

214
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:17,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">information management problem you know</font>

215
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:22,609
traders need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

216
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:24,890
react to it react very quickly so it's a

217
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,930
big deal very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large business</font>

218
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:31,670
intelligence problem and

219
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:33,349
we'll continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be so it's definitely</font>

220
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,110
something there so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move on</font>

221
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my next example which is a</font>

222
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,460
bioinformatics of any questions on the

223
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:46,520
previous one though I guess before I

224
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:48,260
yeah in security risk management right

225
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,240
now the number that I'm constantly asked

226
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,130
for and I basically have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> up is</font>

227
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,410
how likely is something to be exploited

228
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,870
is this something that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be put into</font>

229
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,790
a model in any way and given some I know

230
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,020
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasonable analysis of or</font>

231
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,270
is this going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to be a</font>

232
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">made-up number because honestly in my</font>

233
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,110
opinion it depends on the hacker is how

234
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,540
likely you know something this<font color="#E5E5E5"> obscure</font>

235
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,060
difficult to exploit can be exploited by

236
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:16,250
somebody's properly motivated I don't

237
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:18,589
it's a wonder if this could help me yeah

238
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,110
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say anything I gave it would be</font>

239
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:24,740
more hocus-pocus than reality right i

240
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,510
mean it's that's yeah that's that's a

241
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,680
very very hard thing to judge whether

242
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:31,310
something could be I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard</font>

243
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,620
things across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board you know so hard</font>

244
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,819
to say it's hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a tough</font>

245
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,709
question i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean if i could answer that</font>

246
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:40,730
right i'd probably right right exactly

247
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:44,140
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know about that put you</font>

248
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:47,450
something all right so anyway I also

249
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:51,500
another area that I've you know done

250
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,670
modeling in is bioinformatics which you

251
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,800
know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of similarities</font>

252
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,390
between actually the modeling that's

253
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,329
done in bioinformatics and the financial

254
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:03,709
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know computational finance so I</font>

255
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:05,540
thought this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logical step so in any</font>

256
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:08,540
case you know what you're doing here is

257
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">your modeling biological systems what I</font>

258
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,170
have most experience with is you know

259
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,560
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at computer simulations of</font>

260
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,630
cellular subsystems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really honing in</font>

261
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,150
on a particular subsystem and trying to

262
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,130
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works this could</font>

263
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:24,529
include<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know metabolism where you're</font>

264
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,200
having metabolites and enzymes that

265
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,570
interact could be signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> transduction</font>

266
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,100
pathways which would be you know

267
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,959
hormones and things like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

268
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,900
gene regulation me it's a huge huge

269
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">world and really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

270
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:44,029
to look at biological systems with

271
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:48,050
some detail so here I'm talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

272
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:49,699
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to look at so I've</font>

273
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen in a lot of cases you know there's</font>

274
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,939
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people who just look directly</font>

275
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,459
at DNA when they're building a

276
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,290
biological model and they try to

277
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,359
understand gene expression and how that

278
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,029
relates to protein production and how

279
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,829
those proteins interact in your body

280
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,839
some people have taken simplified

281
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,339
approaches where they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

282
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,209
directly at proteins and they try to

283
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:13,130
understand how proteins interact you

284
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,959
know what how they create enzymes and

285
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,699
you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it understands metabolism</font>

286
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,420
and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is used to understand</font>

287
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:22,910
metabolism but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a tough</font>

288
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,439
problem and its really balancing

289
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,680
complexity with accuracy I mean

290
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously it's more it's more correct to</font>

291
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,758
look directly at DNA that's actually

292
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:34,459
what the problem is you know that's

293
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,220
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> things start but you know these</font>

294
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:38,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">are these are huge problems so</font>

295
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,160
simplifying the problem and looking at

296
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,560
different aspects and isolating the

297
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,410
problem is really a big deal with

298
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,339
bioinformatics so just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

299
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,439
an overview there so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just one</font>

300
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,459
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good picture that I saw that you</font>

301
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">know kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of show you just the</font>

302
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:56,930
complexity of the problem you have just

303
00:13:54,949 --> 00:14:00,290
tons of interactions happening all over

304
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,329
the place<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example is you</font>

305
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,579
know it's got I can see a pop toasts

306
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:08,209
there and gene regulation so you know

307
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,829
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how gene</font>

308
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:13,069
regulation effects cell proliferation

309
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:16,008
how you know a cell apoptosis is when a

310
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:18,380
cell is basically told to kill itself

311
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:21,790
and you know die and so I mean you have

312
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,170
a huge amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

313
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,630
you know you have external factors which

314
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,709
are these ones this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of shows what i</font>

315
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,130
was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking at a</font>

316
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,989
subsystem you treat things like you know

317
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,259
these hormones and these growth factors

318
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,910
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things as external factors</font>

319
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:42,949
and you really isolate what's happening

320
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:44,480
in your particular subsystem so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

321
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,370
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into too much detail</font>

322
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,889
here just you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good picture</font>

323
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,510
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you give you a rough</font>

324
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:54,030
idea what these problems are and

325
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,370
and the next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

326
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,500
something like this weather where you

327
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">have actually a set of differential</font>

328
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,490
equations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that describe each of these</font>

329
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:08,310
interactions so you know ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

330
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,680
each of these arrows is a chemical

331
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,359
equation it's got a certain you know

332
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate constant to find with it there's</font>

333
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,630
there's certain numeric parameters that

334
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,590
govern each one and you could you know

335
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,570
you can build something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

336
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,460
theoretically in every single case it's

337
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,900
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just figuring out where you want</font>

338
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:29,790
to do it and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do it so</font>

339
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,850
like I said here and here that there's

340
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,099
also here are literally the chemical

341
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,230
equations that are described and you

342
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,500
have concentrations of each different

343
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,990
chemical changing over time and you know

344
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,670
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can really drill down and look at</font>

345
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and start to understand what</font>

346
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,750
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at and then you'll have</font>

347
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">an objective function which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is at the</font>

348
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">top here where you're actually you know</font>

349
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,810
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your body's trying to</font>

350
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,300
obtain so here it's a minimize but I

351
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,890
mean it could be something like the cell

352
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,990
is try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to maximize the</font>

353
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:05,610
amount of glucose<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the cell or really</font>

354
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:08,070
anything and one place where I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

355
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,740
this used a lot is where they're using

356
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,240
bacteria to manufacture chemicals and

357
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,780
proteins which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about a little</font>

358
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,930
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in the next slide so that's</font>

359
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:21,839
called you know bioprocess engineering

360
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:25,349
so for instance manufacturing insulin

361
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,530
which diabetics need industrial

362
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:31,070
chemicals like ethanol that's a big one

363
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:33,480
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean being able to do all this</font>

364
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,690
requires huge amounts of you know of

365
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,460
computing resources it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

366
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,730
unbelievable how complex these problems

367
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,890
can get and there's large dollar amounts

368
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,290
associated with all these problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

369
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies can have huge</font>

370
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,910
savings especially if they're making you

371
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,430
know insulin on very large levels or

372
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:56,790
ethanol or whatever it may be so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

373
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely it's a new and upcoming thing</font>

374
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,500
that's that's going to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

375
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:03,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">develop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think so i think that's my</font>

376
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,900
last slide for this one right so we have

377
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,150
any equal

378
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,890
is any of this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a lot to look</font>

379
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,890
at in a probably small amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

380
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is sort of a comment as</font>

381
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,639
follow on to the last question<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

382
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:31,180
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your statistical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gathering</font>

383
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:35,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">one one place I see that this could be</font>

384
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:39,400
useful in our space in IT security in

385
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,590
particular that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for dlp or data</font>

386
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,360
loss prevention and the first step in

387
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,990
data loss prevention is all about

388
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">information management and understanding</font>

389
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,940
where your data is in your environment

390
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,590
and too often<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces</font>

391
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,810
of intellectual property or other

392
00:17:53,590 --> 00:18:02,050
sensitive documents floating around and

393
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:04,450
who knows where and so by by using your

394
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,760
what you're talking about to tag

395
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,640
appropriate fingerprint points if you

396
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,170
will aside from obvious things like

397
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,750
scanning documents for something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

398
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">as confidential but you know more more</font>

399
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:20,830
subtle things you can probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify</font>

400
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,960
what systems are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used today that</font>

401
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,879
you had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that are critical to</font>

402
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,910
business and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just turn them</font>

403
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,470
off but they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a higher level</font>

404
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">of protection put around them you might</font>

405
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,990
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been aware before so using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

406
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,820
statistical analysis you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you can</font>

407
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,650
gather a couple data data points of like

408
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if it has this this this and this</font>

409
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:45,720
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like IDs fingerprinting to right</font>

410
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:49,920
then you might better cost justify

411
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,330
spending money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure systems or</font>

412
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,880
minimize or mitigate some risk that you

413
00:18:52,330 --> 00:19:04,629
didn't need by getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> business groups</font>

414
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:06,390
back on to where they should be really

415
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,130
leaning on what Don was talking about

416
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:12,460
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this statistical analysis don't</font>

417
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,440
we have a ton<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unknowns though I mean</font>

418
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,080
looking at his stuff he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> got so much</font>

419
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,840
historical data and then he's got all of

420
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">this discrete math that he can do on all</font>

421
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this historical data there's there</font>

422
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,900
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of variation there</font>

423
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,100
really isn't a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of unknowns whereas I</font>

424
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,160
kind of feel like an hour search

425
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:33,909
situation even when dlp there is

426
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,200
ton of unknowns so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm curious I</font>

427
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:44,820
would love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see something like this</font>

428
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:47,530
I'm just kind of curious ok so the there

429
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,200
the only reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are not known in</font>

430
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,970
this case in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> context of dlp is</font>

431
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,820
because we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done the work to</font>

432
00:19:51,970 --> 00:20:00,450
identify the fingerprint points what I'm

433
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:06,629
talking about is is to to use a

434
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:08,920
prediction by but I turret to try to get

435
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,470
appropriate positives identify

436
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,630
appropriate data points and then use

437
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,060
that to as justification for spending

438
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,360
but because that's what's you know what

439
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,970
he was really talking about but as far

440
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,240
as the talk this is really to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your point</font>

441
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,710
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about looking at the past and using</font>

442
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,760
it to predict<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future and what might</font>

443
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:33,070
happen so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we need to</font>

444
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,610
do is look outside organizations to look

445
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:39,580
across its industry to statistics for

446
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,729
like garden or whatever like when

447
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:46,300
there's a breach there they cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

448
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,130
much money and when we we can we could

449
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:52,510
take vulnerability assessment tools that

450
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:54,670
we use today and they all rate threat oh

451
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,220
you know Valle nur ability criticality

452
00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:00,610
based on complexity ease of exploitation

453
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:03,030
and and then you add into good threat

454
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,090
modeling practice you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do an</font>

455
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,139
information assurance audit on yourself

456
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to do it to find</font>

457
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who does because you wanted to</font>

458
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,180
write but it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all about valuing</font>

459
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,070
your assets and your dinner to your

460
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,220
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's data or systems or both and</font>

461
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:25,510
then you can combine the threat in the

462
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:29,890
impact based on your valuation couple it

463
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:32,590
with predictive analysis you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can feed</font>

464
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:37,210
that into ok well there's are going to

465
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:40,929
be a likelihood of vulnerability I can

466
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,850
predict that because of my security

467
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,260
posture

468
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,659
we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to really work this out to</font>

469
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">make it a nice smooth presentation right</font>

470
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,830
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's something we could</font>

471
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,390
do here<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is to take the math of it</font>

472
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,730
because it all comes down to a rating of

473
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,570
like 125<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we've all seen this stuff</font>

474
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you could put math behind well</font>

475
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,800
how likely is it that we could get

476
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,290
exploited and then with the ia

477
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,450
information assurance on it how much is

478
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,420
that going to hurt us and that all goes

479
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,220
into justifying budgets or making some

480
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:23,020
decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where to mitigate</font>

481
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:24,760
our risk as I do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one area where</font>

482
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:29,710
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do capacity planning from time</font>

483
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,810
to time is in network designing networks

484
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,210
and servers and you know how much

485
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,760
bandwidth you need how many CPUs you

486
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:40,150
need and I was wondering what tools you

487
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:43,930
use for that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if there's our good</font>

488
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:46,030
resources on the net for to say doing an

489
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:50,170
analysis of variance with in OpenOffice

490
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:54,760
calc maybe using sheets extra sheets for

491
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:57,070
extra dimensions that kind of stuff I

492
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,840
think I think the tools I've seen used

493
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,669
are pretty pretty across-the-board I

494
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,129
mean obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spreadsheets and write</font>

495
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:07,570
Excel and openoffice art are the biggest

496
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:09,400
ones especially in finance but that I

497
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,310
mean that I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that a little bit</font>

498
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,830
as a limitation I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it really</font>

499
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">could be doing a lot more using more</font>

500
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,449
sophisticated tools and things like that

501
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,949
of things you know you guys know of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

502
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,950
I answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question a little bit or</font>

503
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:33,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">right how easy are they to learn right</font>

504
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:35,410
right well exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the UM just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

505
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,260
opinion less i think the statistics

506
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:41,800
model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to help and not</font>

507
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,450
necessarily predicting security future

508
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,120
security breaches but what he can do is

509
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,870
baseline what you have you can gather

510
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,969
statistics on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your network servers</font>

511
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,679
and get a baseline and based on that

512
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,670
statistics you can start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

513
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,710
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes out of the ordinary</font>

514
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:05,330
let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for for things like</font>

515
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:07,040
that I think there's automated software

516
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,689
that will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know stuff that</font>

517
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,850
gathers like NetFlow data and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

518
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,440
start zooming in on specific things and

519
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,909
see peaks and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but those</font>

520
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,670
are I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe their statistics based</font>

521
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,140
right in developing point systems and

522
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,120
things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> threshold values</font>

523
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,310
and I guess really looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your</font>

524
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,850
historical data in that context and

525
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,409
being able to identify outliers and

526
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,770
things that are abnormal you know

527
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,960
anomalies things like that so anyway let

528
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,930
me look and is that that it for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

529
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,380
or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> more questions all right I'm</font>

530
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna continue to next next one I'm</font>

531
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,160
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that internet</font>

532
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,630
marketing<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is you know the same</font>

533
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,680
basic theme looking at consumer behavior

534
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:52,880
historical data and trying to predict

535
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:54,770
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to do next so in any</font>

536
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,570
internet marketing situation you're

537
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> database with</font>

538
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,909
transactions and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

539
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:04,520
grouping the transactional data to see

540
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,770
what consumer preferences are and

541
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs a huge amount of</font>

542
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,300
business intelligence software being

543
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to use data cubes and things like</font>

544
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:18,169
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean especially in this</font>

545
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,820
context you have you know a particular

546
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,350
audience and it's understanding what

547
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:25,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience is and what they want to</font>

548
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:27,469
see based on performance you've seen so

549
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first place to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course is</font>

550
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,810
organizing your audience ways I've seen

551
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,639
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> done is you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just by specific</font>

552
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:38,030
qualities like where they live how old

553
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,590
they are gender things like that you

554
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">could also be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing other things like</font>

555
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at right mouse movements clicks</font>

556
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,780
what purchases you've actually seen them

557
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:49,520
perform documenting interests you know

558
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,410
is really these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just examples that I</font>

559
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,000
have thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean there's a lot</font>

560
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:55,880
of ways that it's done and I'm sure

561
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,360
other ways to do it and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

562
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,210
it becomes being able to store this

563
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,709
information succinctly and being able to

564
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:09,200
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> it quickly and use it the way you</font>

565
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:11,480
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it so the next step</font>

566
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,669
is of course organizing your advertising

567
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,049
so you've organized your audience you

568
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:16,610
understand you know you've grouped them

569
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:19,309
in different ways you understand certain

570
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:22,209
qualities about them 90 to look into

571
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:25,610
organizing the ads you want to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

572
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:27,200
so you know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of different</font>

573
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,969
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this it's the simple way it</font>

574
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,289
would be just assigning categories to

575
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:35,360
advertising tracking trends you know if

576
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:38,510
you see that males from a particular

577
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,158
demographic like a particular certain

578
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,260
type of AD I mean you document that it's

579
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,130
all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> just finding these these</font>

580
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:56,990
correlations in these relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

581
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:58,490
understanding them but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time</font>

582
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,960
if you think about it a lot of that

583
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,399
stuff regarding like your demographics

584
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,679
and everything it has a computer

585
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:05,239
security equivalent that you could be

586
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,000
taking the exact same things such as a

587
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,649
you know from net flow diagrams we know

588
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,240
where the attacks are coming from we can

589
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:13,309
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see where attacks come from where</font>

590
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,200
they go two types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks browser</font>

591
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:17,059
based attacks das attacks things like

592
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,190
that I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this advertising</font>

593
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,740
stuff in a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> irony could actually</font>

594
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:24,710
translate over well to information

595
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,850
security in terms of predicting what not

596
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,139
necessarily predicting the seeing what's

597
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,959
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and they may be using</font>

598
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:32,389
that to give us some<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced knowledge</font>

599
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,590
of where to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

600
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:36,860
there's actually some good cross over

601
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:39,019
there really well it makes sense i mean

602
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,519
it's all yeah just you know similar

603
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:41,809
problems right yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the thing</font>

604
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when you think in demographics you</font>

605
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:45,070
know from an advertising perspective

606
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,080
you're thinking you know age range

607
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,320
gender or where they live<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could</font>

608
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">replace that with things that we're</font>

609
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking to predict right where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are ya</font>

610
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly where the attacks coming from</font>

611
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,510
who's getting hit that kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

612
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually take</font>

613
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:04,610
a lot of this advertising going right

614
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,940
and concepts and actually use them in

615
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:10,779
information assurance that's good that's

616
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,779
good definitely

617
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so taking kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those big</font>

618
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,419
ideas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking it down</font>

619
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,309
into something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works the step one I</font>

620
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:24,220
see is like a decision tree like I have

621
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:28,000
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just taking some simple</font>

622
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:32,110
number like age grouping each age group

623
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,230
and then looking to break it down to

624
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:37,149
decisions so I mean this is assuming

625
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,909
right that you actually have this kind

626
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,860
of data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your users and that you</font>

627
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:43,750
actually have relatively good

628
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:47,590
categorization of the ads you're looking

629
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:49,150
to post and you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start to</font>

630
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sense of a situation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could look</font>

631
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:56,740
at this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

632
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,840
of detail here and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into</font>

633
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,720
too much detail but basically you would

634
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,939
use decision trees in a way that would

635
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,590
allow you to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if I was just</font>

636
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing this particular advertising to</font>

637
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,740
this group how would it how would it

638
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,539
have done if i just showed this

639
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,080
advertising to this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> group how</font>

640
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:15,879
would it do or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you look at</font>

641
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,600
your past experience and you try to hone

642
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,280
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where things make sense and</font>

643
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,250
decision trees are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

644
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,750
you can use their<font color="#E5E5E5"> and only get into too</font>

645
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,840
much detail there because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy</font>

646
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:32,950
to but i think the picture kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shows</font>

647
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,110
you pretty well<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

648
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually was last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their i</font>

649
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:43,449
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions on this this</font>

650
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:45,400
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea all right so last one of</font>

651
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,070
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> was internet security which i</font>

652
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,720
probably have less experience than all

653
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,370
the other ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spoke about so I</font>

654
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,990
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use kind of a simple example</font>

655
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:58,120
that seemed intuitive to me a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

656
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,100
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the different twist on what you</font>

657
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:04,689
guys were talking about it in this case

658
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:06,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">online casinos so most the time I think</font>

659
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">when you talked about internet security</font>

660
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:13,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're thinking of external threats like</font>

661
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:15,100
what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying with online casinos</font>

662
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,049
they have a lot of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

663
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,639
actually internal which is you know

664
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:21,639
they're actually users gaming their

665
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,100
system so a couple examples of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

666
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,970
like chipped up chip dumping where

667
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,219
people are

668
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:30,429
using online casinos to transport money

669
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:33,190
across country lines player collusion

670
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:35,980
that's a pretty obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> one where a</font>

671
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,539
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get gang up on you know</font>

672
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,750
one or two other people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a room and</font>

673
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:44,140
they collude and use their knowledge to

674
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:46,570
to win things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and then there's</font>

675
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">also foreign exchange they have a lot of</font>

676
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,010
foreign exchange problems because online

677
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">casinos operate across country lines</font>

678
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:58,270
they're very susceptible to foreign

679
00:30:52,870 --> 00:31:01,090
exchange fraud so I kind of just went

680
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,370
through some<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple simple ways simple</font>

681
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,709
logic that you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement to</font>

682
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:10,360
prevent these kind of things just simple

683
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:13,179
rules nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> too too complex here you</font>

684
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,789
know so in this case player collusion

685
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:20,049
very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see two IP addresses in</font>

686
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:21,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same room for more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than a week you</font>

687
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,620
know twice in a single week you know

688
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:27,220
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something wrong you need to</font>

689
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,719
probably flag those users or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

690
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:33,820
take whatever preventive measures you

691
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:37,539
need to in that case right that's that's

692
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,549
a another that's a simple simple way to

693
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:43,809
break it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you'd have to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

694
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:44,980
a way to to account for that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

695
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure how you deal with that actually</font>

696
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,460
good point

697
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:08,989
all right then another example right

698
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,610
chip dumping so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> leagues in you know</font>

699
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:12,919
the rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came up here which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

700
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,110
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just uh you said a</font>

701
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,139
transactional limit you don't allow over

702
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:20,508
a certain amount to be moved between

703
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:24,350
countries and you have to manually

704
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:25,759
approve the process I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

705
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:30,889
there's probably simple ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break</font>

706
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:33,649
that too but right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is this is</font>

707
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:35,119
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a i think a larger problem in</font>

708
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:38,029
you know Eastern Europe you know a lot

709
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these online casinos are basically</font>

710
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:43,940
being used to transfer money across

711
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:46,029
country<font color="#CCCCCC"> lines so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both go into a room</font>

712
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,999
and I just continually lose to you and

713
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:53,299
you know I'm money laundering yeah

714
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:55,309
that's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

715
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:57,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">are things that the online casinos can't</font>

716
00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:00,168
you know they can't be letting that

717
00:32:57,379 --> 00:33:01,488
happen you know that's a big breach of

718
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:03,499
their security so they have to you know

719
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:07,279
take preventive means and measures to

720
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:09,429
prevent it and then of course foreign

721
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,769
exchange frauds pretty simple one I mean

722
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:14,600
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know taking simple</font>

723
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:16,309
measures to you know update your

724
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,799
exchange rates and things like that I

725
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:23,619
mean if a if a user is able to figure

726
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,840
out that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the way your you're</font>

727
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:28,908
implementing exchange rates is

728
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,238
ineffective I mean they can easily start

729
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:33,649
gaming you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> making money just off</font>

730
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:36,200
converting currencies through your

731
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:37,609
online casino so I mean you know these

732
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">are these are all sound like pretty</font>

733
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:42,320
simple things but I mean they have very

734
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:45,408
large ramifications for these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

735
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,090
business so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just in</font>

736
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping with the overall theme that I've</font>

737
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:52,220
been hitting this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using past</font>

738
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:55,789
data and trying to prevent problems or

739
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:58,369
predicts you know purchases and things

740
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:03,499
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so try to touch on this a</font>

741
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:05,809
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in conclusion you</font>

742
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:07,730
know modeling is becoming important it's

743
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:08,540
important a lot of places as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all</font>

744
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,900
heard

745
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:14,029
and it all depends on computation you

746
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,250
know being able to implement manage data

747
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:19,640
and find trends with business

748
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,440
development and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

749
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,080
summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know anyone has any</font>

750
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:31,400
questions on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> last example other</font>

751
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:33,500
than what I've heard if we're interested

752
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">in exploring this can you recommend some</font>

753
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,860
software i mean there's there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font>

754
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,090
of things out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there mean SPSS is pretty</font>

755
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,429
famous there are some open source

756
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,600
equivalents but that's pretty complex he

757
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:43,639
could never active data level to like

758
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,918
sequel sequel so rattled analysis

759
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,750
services do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good place to</font>

760
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,960
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> reversibility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to explore</font>

761
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,730
this I've used<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel server it's pretty</font>

762
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerful but it's also pretty expensive</font>

763
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:59,750
too but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful I mean you</font>

764
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,959
can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's relatively easy to</font>

765
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:06,290
learn what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been using lately a lot</font>

766
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,060
is pentaho which I've actually liked a

767
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:10,220
lot that's open source cheap I've been

768
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,710
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a little while to figure out a</font>

769
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,180
lot of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know quirks i mean you can</font>

770
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,310
get stopped up on something real simple

771
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,410
and there's not a lot of documentation

772
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,540
out there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i would recommend</font>

773
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that very highly sequel server if you</font>

774
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,740
have if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the budget to do</font>

775
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,590
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's great</font>

776
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">too that works well but there's a lot of</font>

777
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,920
tools out there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah pentaho i think</font>

778
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,210
is it is great i mean you can download

779
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,450
it start messing around it that they

780
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,700
have a couple different applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

781
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,669
use their data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gracian software a</font>

782
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,020
lot that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you have data</font>

783
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,360
sitting across a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

784
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:46,340
databases really easy way to just kind

785
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,770
of pull it all together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and shoot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

786
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,570
in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> excel format you start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

787
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it sending it to other people automating</font>

788
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,560
it on emails it's really easy to figure

789
00:35:52,790 --> 00:36:03,700
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's your question a little bit</font>

790
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:03,700
or pentaho<font color="#E5E5E5"> p e.n.t aho</font>

791
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,230
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I don't know if</font>

792
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,480
there are any other open source business

793
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligence software like that you know</font>

794
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:24,450
it's a bunch of others talent talent is

795
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:26,010
one ok so a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff out there</font>

796
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,779
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's just getting the</font>

797
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,180
documentation figuring out how to use it

798
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,109
as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest hurdle but i think if you</font>

799
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:37,558
hammer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out it can be done hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

800
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:40,259
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions one regarding the tools</font>

801
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,240
aspect you mention pentaho and excel are

802
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,300
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> using other kind of programming</font>

803
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,259
languages<font color="#E5E5E5"> how model or it sounds really</font>

804
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,369
manual what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process you're doing</font>

805
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,710
you're getting a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font>

806
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:51,750
give you log the important into pentaho

807
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:55,800
and then export XL yeah it is pretty

808
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:57,089
manual currently more because you know

809
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,460
you need to actually be in touch with

810
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and you actually have to really</font>

811
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,040
get a feel for things before you can

812
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,720
start automating things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

813
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,130
you're right i think eventually you have

814
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,848
to move to automate things and get away

815
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">from a manual process but depending on</font>

816
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:12,180
what you're doing the manual process is

817
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,730
important for the first you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a</font>

818
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple steps and as you start to really</font>

819
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,690
understand you know what the outliers

820
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:20,040
and your data are or what the trends

821
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,950
you're trying to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think then you</font>

822
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,359
move to automation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as like a</font>

823
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,040
second step and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be real</font>

824
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:28,109
careful just about automating these kind

825
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,750
of things because you know there's this

826
00:37:28,109 --> 00:37:32,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big impact on all these things so that</font>

827
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,980
that answer your question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is great and</font>

828
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:37,559
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> second question I have is</font>

829
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:40,200
clarification with respecting internal

830
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:41,970
versus external threats<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read at your</font>

831
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">external threats or just people doing</font>

832
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,169
random port scans and brute force

833
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,000
attacks and insider threat is actually

834
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:51,359
somebody abusing the application itself

835
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,220
we in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your example online casinos users</font>

836
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,410
actually logged in and abusing the

837
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,299
system the application itself and not

838
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,279
insider threat as in an employee within

839
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:00,869
the organization oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true yeah</font>

840
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,359
yeah that is generally how that term is

841
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:06,049
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay at that point taken all right</font>

842
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,049
great thanks

843
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:17,180
okay anybody else good<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks</font>

844
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:17,180
thanks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> listening</font>

845
