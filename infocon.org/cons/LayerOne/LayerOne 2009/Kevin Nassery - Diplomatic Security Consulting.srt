1
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,239
so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Kevin Austria and you know</font>

2
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,100
I at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the last talk I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

3
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,200
really started to have some some great

4
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,360
question back and forth about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dichotomy between you know what us</font>

6
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,590
as I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us in this room kind</font>

7
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,060
of described themselves as you know

8
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,380
technologists and people who love kind

9
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the nuts and bolts of Technology and</font>

10
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,030
that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we got into it as a</font>

11
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,970
hobby into a career transition which I

12
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,850
definitely put myself in that category

13
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,890
and you know how do we kind of expend

14
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,309
that influence on the business without

15
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,580
necessarily making it a you know

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:28,200
head-butting challenge and you know I

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,840
spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far 11 years of my career where</font>

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,729
I was the go-to guide to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,530
but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if something was broke and</font>

20
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:39,950
it rhymed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick's or Isco I was the</font>

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,050
guy they put in the room to fix it now

22
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I was the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they put in the</font>

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,570
room to fix the issue you know I would

24
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,550
walk into a cage you know early on as a

25
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">network engineer for her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exodus and</font>

26
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,050
professional services with you know 40

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,130
devices just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in a cage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'd</font>

28
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,710
walk out and there would be a working

29
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,420
network whether or not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

30
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,339
cage I knew how any of it worked you

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,720
know or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I grew up</font>

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,659
solving problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's kind of how</font>

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,630
i made you know the first six years of

34
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,330
my career successful and then I kind of

35
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,060
stopped and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I stopped kind of</font>

36
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,070
growing in in the sense where I would

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,200
still love to grow technically but from

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,359
a career wise I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stalled there</font>

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,000
for a couple years so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is</font>

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,400
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of i figured out i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,370
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it last year as to why i stopped</font>

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,860
and so i'm going to get into basically

43
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,959
if i could go back in time five years

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,190
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and narrowly avoid sleeping with my</font>

45
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,410
own mother this is the the slide deck

46
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,660
that i would give out you know to myself

47
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,090
in order to try to avoid some of these

48
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,130
challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've been faced on so</font>

49
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,049
you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a lot of security</font>

50
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,638
talks and the last thing I would want to

51
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,560
do in this day a day just come to a

52
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,580
security talk without hard data so

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,490
although embarrassing I have taken

54
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,670
I had a 360 review last year as part of

55
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,980
a program at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company i was at for</font>

56
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,750
more than five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably five</font>

57
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,060
out of the ten people that filled it out

58
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I had worked with it even past career so</font>

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,550
I have data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten of my</font>

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:22,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">years on what I was doing wrong and what</font>

62
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll go over some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that the the</font>

63
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,339
targeted at people who excel with

64
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,220
technology and<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem solving so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

65
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,730
am as far as knowing my audience I think

66
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,830
all of us in this room love the

67
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,359
technology aspect of it some of us can

68
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,150
deal with the business aspects and some

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,709
of us can't so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think we've</font>

70
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard a lot of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges dealing</font>

with social issues and stuff like that

72
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,880
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I am knowing my audience and yet</font>

73
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,609
i'm going to proceed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you this</font>

74
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,390
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of soft talk that really has</font>

nothing to do with the technology

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,029
problems at all just really evolving<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

my last<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years of failures now that</font>

81
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,500
on youtube when i submitted my resume to

82
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,299
you you want a guy who's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,280
recognizes at least that he missed that

84
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,580
now the corrective action and course

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,890
correction<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've taken I think it's</font>

86
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,919
working for me now and that's why i<font color="#CCCCCC"> sat</font>

87
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,899
to share this data I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everybody</font>

00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,060
likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think you know we're unique I</font>

89
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,460
figure worst case and nobody in this

90
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,720
room applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and I am a one in the</font>

91
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,840
million where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unique situation</font>

92
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,310
to me there's at least a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> chubby</font>

93
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,409
Chinese guys that might see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on</font>

94
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,600
youtube based on the statistics alone

95
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,669
that might have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of connection</font>

96
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,470
to this so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my goal here is to</font>

97
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:46,310
get more people consulting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

98
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,470
an incredibly invaluable experience to

99
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,570
even you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the problem solvers to see</font>

100
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,970
more than one<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment to move from</font>

101
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,979
one organization to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next if nothing</font>

102
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,560
else then to see what you really enjoy

103
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,979
doing I think you know some of us flock

104
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,380
to you know operations work or security

105
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,770
services work where we're doing the same

106
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,850
thing kind of over and over again

107
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,650
without getting our feet wet<font color="#E5E5E5"> in new</font>

108
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,210
scenarios because

109
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,820
is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to deal</font>

110
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,258
with not necessarily less bullshit but

111
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,000
at least the same bullshit and we

112
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">develop coping mechanisms with that</font>

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,610
bullshit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of move forward</font>

114
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,110
that way so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> would anybody want it do</font>

115
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,470
that I've kind of made a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

116
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,580
points<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know it's also another</font>

117
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,160
great opportunity to be very

118
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,169
goal-oriented in project focus and to

119
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,229
get yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real good perspective on</font>

120
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,198
what worked and what didn't whether it

121
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:43,760
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> across projects technologically</font>

122
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:46,010
socially politically and it's it's great

123
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">for people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who also try to dabble in</font>

124
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,630
more than one areas and as security

125
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,150
being a dimension of every technology in

126
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,830
the workplace not just countermeasures

127
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,820
but security as a part of development or

128
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,030
security as a part of network

129

up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that expert level on your own what</font>

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,239
enterprise you get chartered into a role

and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that same flexibility</font>

139
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,729
and it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very detrimental to</font>

140
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,530
productive people just because they get

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:39,349
influence and that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the theme</font>

145
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,530
of this talk in an organization is

146
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:44,510
either difficult or<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely difficult</font>

147
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:47,059
nobody walks into a room and has people

148
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,969
listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them because they like them</font>

149
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,639
they believe them it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a trust issue</font>

150
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,430
it's a complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to get somebody not</font>

151
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,500
only to trust you and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even to</font>

152
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:01,010
trust you<font color="#CCCCCC"> but yet still influence you in</font>

153
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,780
a way and that can be a real big

154
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,760
challenge beyond just the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

155
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,229
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> struck myself as kind of a</font>

156
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">likable guy outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the office you</font>

157
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,650
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never had any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues you know</font>

158
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,179
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people or getting in the</font>

159
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,580
end of the arguments but you'll see some

160
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,310
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they hear where people had</font>

161
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,289
started to view me not necessarily as

162
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,849
that same problem solver that they grew

163
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,919
love when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> threw him into the room</font>

164
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:22,940
but now when I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> has things to say</font>

165
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,419
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization</font>

166
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,120
and almost as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a roadblock or somebody</font>

167
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know which I you know somebody who</font>

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,900
Jim you know maybe suspected i would

169
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,200
have needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be removed from an</font>

170
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,239
organization just because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

171
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,960
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was getting frustrated and</font>

172
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,810
through frustration comes more and more

173
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,130
confrontation<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so it requires a</font>

174
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,410
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of social and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> political awareness</font>

175
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,850
and then you know for me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when</font>

176
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,150
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an engagement you know I'm</font>

177
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:55,040
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a casual dresser dresser that</font>

178
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,739
can't always be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case as a consultant</font>

179
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,470
but a lot of the times you know there's

180
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,810
opportunities to relax there too so

181
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,190
rather than describe my background

182
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,840
specifically although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a bit of</font>

183
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:12,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is what those 11 let's see</font>

184
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,810
yeah 12 people thought of me in 2008 and

185
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,950
this is a skills ranking off of 360

186
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,530
review which if you ever have the

187
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity should definitely do and I</font>

188
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,760
took the hard numbers out because if you

189
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,919
saw it start with like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 you know it</font>

190
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,659
would kind of deteriorate my point here

191
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,850
but you know at the top of here is

192
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,320
intellectual horsepower functional

193
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,330
technical skills and problem solving

194
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,710
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely if I had to sell</font>

195
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,680
myself those would be the things i would

196
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">sell myself on and then you know kind of</font>

197
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,620
halfway through here there's

198
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,669
presentation skills you guys might argue

199
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,490
that that should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit lower</font>

200
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:48,220
in a few minutes but towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom</font>

201
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:50,840
is you know listening action-oriented

202
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,210
motivating others and customer focus

203
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,880
that is not how I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell myself to</font>

204
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:58,610
an organization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those skills</font>

205
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,200
being on the bottom in 2008 I think

206
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hurt my ability to influence the</font>

207
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,670
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the better so where did</font>

208
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,560
I go wrong so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is comments from that</font>

209
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,620
same review that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an</font>

210
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">ammonite and you know at the first part</font>

211
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it you know every comment started off</font>

212
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:17,870
good at least the same way where it's

213
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,489
you know extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> talented and</font>

214
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,410
knowledgeable technical skills alone

215
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,150
would be a towering strength you know

216
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,370
Kevin's technical skills are in no way

217
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,589
narrow he has a significant breadth and

218
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,089
depth and many technical topics you see

219
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,210
the same word being used over and over

220
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,089
again I got whiz kid syndrome to the

221
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">highest degree you know I got that</font>

222
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,769
that is what Kevin's good at pigeonhole

223
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:42,410
box don't listen to him on anything else

224
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:44,300
and that crippled me and when you start

225
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,969
to you know lets his nuts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolts</font>

226
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,459
skill get in the way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> his personal and</font>

227
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,559
business persona that's why I'm not

228
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,869
making traction and when I saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

229
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,850
was a real eye-opener not that I

230
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,089
necessarily agreed with everything in

231
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the comments but at least I knew you</font>

232
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">know there's there's no harder data than</font>

233
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">11 people being in the same organization</font>

234
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,459
in you saying they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you your</font>

235
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">business and personal persona and as a</font>

236
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:11,029
leader<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would rate him as being narrow</font>

237
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:13,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">because he focused so much of his time</font>

238
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,629
on the technical I had the most

239
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,839
technical job there you know I was the

240
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:19,850
infrastructure architect you know my job

241
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,649
was purely technical i was given

242
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,120
business requirements and i made

243
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,240
technical solutions and here they're

244
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,350
saying he spends too much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his time</font>

245
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,529
essentially doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> his job that's the</font>

246
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,420
argument they're using to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say let's not</font>

247
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:36,019
give him any more you know political

248
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,339
influence this other one comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

249
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,589
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> times where sometimes he makes</font>

250
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:42,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">people feel inferior to his mental</font>

251
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,999
skills that was one that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

252
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,949
didn't agreement but when you start to

253
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:48,110
do the the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of derivation of where</font>

254
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that comes from the one thing I did do</font>

255
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,569
is I made every argument that I could I

256
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,339
put it in my wheelhouse you know I took

257
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,829
people out of their comfort zone and

258
00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:00,639
said okay this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your solution to this</font>

259
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:03,979
problem and i gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> them technical facts</font>

260
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,220
that said why it's wrong now those

261
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,420
arguments are undoubtedly convincing

262
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,670
especially if you can prove from A to B

263
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,649
that a triangle is similar you know

264
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,459
similar to another triangle and have a

265
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:18,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">very direct approach to doing that but</font>

266
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:20,768
what it does do is make people who can't

267
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:23,269
interpret that data on the same level

268
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,499
they're out of their wheel box now and

269
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,439
now they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to work with</font>

270
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:29,329
you and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody has that same</font>

271
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:32,779
skill sets that take the same inputs I

272
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:36,498
can and make a rational decision on when

273
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:39,230
I say don't trust me trust the inputs

274
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:40,670
and do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your damn self that</font>

275
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,809
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> people out of their wheelhouse and</font>

276
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,949
that's really what was hurting me a lot

277
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,569
moving on he needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful not to</font>

278
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:48,510
intimidate others at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same level I</font>

279
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:49,620
think that's

280
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,760
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment from two different people</font>

281
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,990
saying almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same thing and</font>

282
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,490
this third one while Kevin is often

283
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,810
right he's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get buy-in from</font>

284
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,670
others without approaching them a

285
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,770
different way so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just telling me</font>

286
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:06,180
I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

287

tried to do moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there so</font>

288
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,390
you know that kind of led me to the

289
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,650
conclusion that no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how right I am</font>

290
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:17,250
some decisions aren't mine in an

influence over time based on the work

297
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,940
they've done being accurate and

298
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,290
technically adept doesn't get you very

299
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,450
far alone that's me you know I was

300
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,329
one-hundred-percent always in my comfort

301
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,400
zone but I couldn't influence people and

302
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,740
I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make things better anymore i</font>

303
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:48,840
could make things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fell one hundred</font>

304
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:52,110
percent in my domain better which after

305
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,810
a year at the most you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know depending on</font>

306
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,980
the scale of what you're responsible for

307
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,199
you know web servers you know you

308
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,000
rebuild them you know automated builds

309
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">go through those processes there's only</font>

some fun aight amount of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done</font>

311
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you're at how can I influence</font>

312
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,970
the organization to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so</font>

313
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a point that's made a couple of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">times today that I really found you know</font>

struck home with<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me throughout you</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> both the talks that that both Jim</font>

317
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:22,110
and Strom gave and this last one

318
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">business leaders won't trust you until</font>

319
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,530
they believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

320
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,110
business is the driver for all decisions

321
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,550
and this is the point at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the</font>

322
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,310
last you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're talking about</font>

323
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,729
arguing with the business and that's not

324
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to go you can make a case and</font>

325
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out risk but when you get into</font>

326
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:46,050
those arguments you place people at a

327
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:47,760
juxtaposition to yourself where they

328
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,120
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your goal is to make</font>

329
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,370
something arbitrarily secure and their

330
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">business is is based on making money and</font>

331
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,930
accepting risks and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> those their</font>

332
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,010
decision so you need to inform them in a

333
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,500
way where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

334
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,030
make it a confrontation always and you

335
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,950
know documentation and everything is

336
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,380
good but I think the way to best<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell</font>

337
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,020
security is to be on the business aside

338
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,790
and say an approach every problem in be

339
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,890
up front that says here's the business

340
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,089
solution to this problem whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">security problem or a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business solution</font>

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,090
to anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're you're trying to</font>

343
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,230
architect a solution for and say and

344
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,750
consistently keep those stakeholder

345
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,760
views in line this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

346
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,770
know architectural approaches have kind

of formalized in the last couple of

348
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,880
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that you see</font>

349
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,680
amongst all of them is formalizing that

350
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,570
stakeholder view of your solution in the

351
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,729
business architecture throughout and

352
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,370
once you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop or reduce or</font>

353
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,230
minimize or make it a smaller font on a

354
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,370
slide where it says you know policy

<font color="#E5E5E5">business architecture and stuff like</font>

versus working for the for the love of

Technology and which is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

got<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of categorized is doing you</font>

the guy that developed reasonable

solutions to business problems in a very

366
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:17,640
effective way so some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font>

367
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">been doing to try to improve that in my</font>

own right and I hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are</font>

369
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,810
relatable to some of you in projects

370
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,730
your work on is when I state problems

371
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,589
and when I go into those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I always</font>

372
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to state problems with respect to</font>

373
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,740
the fundamental business and economic

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,810
impacts as part of the project

375
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,940
definition and that's something that we

376
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,040
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier that root cause picture of</font>

that person you know touching<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fire</font>

379
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,569
to policy versus you know something not

being hardened or something like that

381
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,690
what is the root<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause that we're trying</font>

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,790
network sucks because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were dumb in</font>

395
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,270
the way you built your network and it's

396
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,459
not the

397
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,140
case when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the raw data</font>

things evolved you know if you have a

small missing skill set or you a small

400
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,910
budgetary gap you see a small problem

401
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we I use this phrase where I</font>

see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small networks that grew</font>

scalability issue is present in

405
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,030
everything we do and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

406
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,480
somebody made a conscious decision to

407
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:42,630
screw it up it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it never became</font>

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,810
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem until it steam rolled into a</font>

410
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,520
made bad decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to say that</font>

411
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:53,400
people neglected an issue but sometimes

412
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,620
it's just omission you know it's just

413
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">this wasn't on our radar because it</font>

wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really impacting our operations</font>

and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> although it's a steeper problem</font>

416
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,930
to solve it is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a new problem</font>

417
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:08,940
it's it's not something that was there

418
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:10,770
and I decided to keep it always approach

419
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,540
issues with the ability to execute on

supporting evidence for the solution you

know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that we tend to do</font>

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,459
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a new environment or the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">here is that we need to come up with our</font>

C and you'll be surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much</font>

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,890

and even your forward channels and say

steps of execution just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay very</font>

460

execution focused I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

461
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,379
people fail because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend two years</font>

462
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,760
complaining about something and then

463
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,910
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they finally have a good idea to</font>

fix something<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are they've already</font>

465
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,330
lost that influence because you know

466
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,790
that all they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is</font>

467
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,010
complaining or deciding that other

things we're inferior you know whether

469
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,450
it be within the responsibility or not

470
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,310

if you have an awesome sales guy but I

477
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:26,639
think by trip for me what I do is I try

to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that background of what was the</font>

you know was there a breach that led me

let me work with your organization to

to establish good influence if you do it

495
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,320
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be hard also when</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting in the position where the</font>

hundred percent to the skill sets that

499
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have I think you still need to try</font>

500
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,780
to use the influence but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then also you</font>

501
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,129
know like any situation we learn working

502
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,660
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our box and I understand that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to be in on some projects</font>

that require amount of learning and that

505
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,560
can make it harder to establish the

506
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,880
influence thing naturally but you know

507
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,149
smart people need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get ahead of it</font>

508
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,670
enough where hey you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

509

<font color="#CCCCCC">it as in that way look for</font>

511
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,130
organizational gaps that you can help

512
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,170
bridge is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outsider</font>

places where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have really much</font>

514
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,110
smarter people than me there that can

fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem much better than I could</font>

516
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,110
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is because it's outside</font>

517
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">of their organizational charter to do so</font>

518
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,439
they're upset about it they get

00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">frustrated they fall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the same level</font>

520
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">of not having enough influence or a</font>

position where it takes two groups to

522
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,610
solve something and they can't work

523
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,240
effectively with each other anymore you

524
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,979
know what I see countless or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

525
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,990
five out of six organizations that I go

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to have this natural issue where</font>

that's doing operations work as

532
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,960
firewalls but they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font>

just added on to it it's it's in the

537

wrong places they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

either have a really awesome insecure

functioning network at one of the two or

both some some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both I</font>

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,030
gaps a lot of the times are easier to

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,680
bridge as an outsider that<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey I'm</font>

I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> charter to any one specific</font>

influence with each one and and it's a

566

lot easier as an outsider sometimes to

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,039
pieces are there but they just not can't

576
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,090
they cannot work together a consultant

577
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,580
can do that and it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

tactical<font color="#CCCCCC"> wins too so the best thing we</font>

580
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,279
do you know technology wise is we

581
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,720
recognize that something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is simply</font>

582
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,799
misconfigured or whatever in the course

583
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:30,260
of even if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your chartered</font>

goal for your project call those out not

585
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:36,260
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and definitely use the rule</font>

586
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:38,600
of saying hey this would work better you

587
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,799
know I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten ten organizations the</font>

588
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,750
last year that have the same issue you

589
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">should try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it this way its if it's</font>

590
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,039
an easy tactical win where you can solve

<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody's life even if it's outside of</font>

channel and sell that great way to

594
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,260
establish influence with people and you

595
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:57,169
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to have seen it</font>

596
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:00,379
done in 20 different places versus seen

597

it done maybe once or twice<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

to project or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that those</font>

601
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:14,479
winds are really valuable for four

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,850
people in terms of process or whatever

603
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,070
and they're there to the you know people

604
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,139
try to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know lean on the sides of</font>

tactics but tactics are something that

607
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:28,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">we know by heart are easy wins as</font>

608

consultants we see see them a lot sell

609

them you know sell them to your customer

610

is coming one hundred percent from for

me you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I stopped</font>

having influence in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font>

620
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,668
it's one is perceived arrogance when I

621
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,990
made people uncomfortable taking them

622
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:04,490
out of their wheelhouse they said well

623

Kevin's trying to be smarter<font color="#CCCCCC"> than me the</font>

624
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,029
the second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual arrogance you</font>

625
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:12,379
see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from time to time</font>

626
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:15,200
I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have if it's difficult to get a</font>

627
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:17,269
reflection of that on any one of us and

628
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,399
that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't talk about myself so</font>

629
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:21,499
much as I presented the here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

630
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:23,178
people had to say about me thing and

631
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:26,269
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave you know lead you to</font>

believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a regardless of whether or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not I felt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was being arrogant</font>

634
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:33,379
people perceive me as arrogant and

635
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:36,769
that's the problem on influence to is

636
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:40,009
not listening and not seeking out input

637
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:41,809
from the right people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I I saw</font>

638
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:45,440
problems in other organizations and I

639
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:47,239
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know solutions and stuff like</font>

640
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but when you don't listen a when</font>

641
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:50,089
you're discussing somebody something

642
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,279
with something regardless of whether or

643
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:54,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">not you care with your opinion the way</font>

644
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:58,729
to to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> past the argument is to listen</font>

645
00:25:54,649 --> 00:26:00,678
completely to their argument whether or

646
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:03,710
not it's right or wrong just listening

647
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">to their argument a you you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

648
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,849
really if it's true or correct take the

649
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:09,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">person out of the picture you know even</font>

650
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,210
people you don't like can come up with

651
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,460
good ideas sometimes and if you get into

652
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that position where you don't listen to</font>

653
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,419
somebody because of who they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you're</font>

654
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,399
setting yourself up for failure on a lot

655
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:23,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different levels so get past that and</font>

656
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:25,789
listen to people too if you take the

657
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:28,460
time to listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people they will take</font>

658
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:30,859
the time it's a very psychological thing

659
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,349
they will a lot of times take the time

660
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:35,330
to listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and at least if they</font>

661
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:37,039
don't if even if you don't arrive to one

662
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,080
hundred percent agreement they feel

663
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,299
comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a full exchange of</font>

664
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,549
ideas has taken place and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got that</font>

665
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:46,700
gets you past a lot of arguments whether

666
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:51,139
you're right or wrong or whether you

667
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:53,539
think they're right or wrong fourth one

668
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:56,449
if you catch yourself doing this you

669
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:58,369
know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a rut where you see</font>

670
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,339
people say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand</font>

671
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:04,789
this issue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stuff like flat-out</font>

672
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:06,080
you're wrong that that's when it's time

673
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take a step back from this argument</font>

674
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,199
because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing anything</font>

675
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,639
productive at that point there's other

676
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,129
ways to phrase this where it's like you

677
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:15,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't understand the idea of risk you</font>

678
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:17,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">know like I do that's just saying that</font>

679
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,710
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different views on risk I</font>

680
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:21,290
have the right view and you have the

681
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,600
wrong view those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work for</font>

682
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,310
people and it just automatically

683
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,800
escalates the issue into a personal

684
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,870
issue from a professional issue and man

685
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,620
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kill whatever you're trying to</font>

686
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:36,469
do for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know five is getting</font>

687
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,800
frustrated in general we all get

688
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:42,140
frustrated we all get visibly frustrated

689
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,440
the parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> about getting frustrated that</font>

690
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,630
lead into a loss of influence is when

691
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,510
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get emotionally frustrated in front</font>

of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things that aren't one</font>

693

hundred percent or about anything really

694
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,320
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sometimes we do this over</font>

695
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,180
silly things where it's it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

696
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe a policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or procedure</font>

697
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,720
that you don't want how<font color="#E5E5E5"> two percent</font>

698
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,340
agree with maybe somebody said you don't

699
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,830
understand you're wrong and you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

700
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,330
get those frustrations nothing good

701
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,580
comes from it so you got to maintain

702
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,780
some emotional distance in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

703
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,370
that you still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to care about your</font>

704
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,350
projects and your quality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font>

705
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,909
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you start to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> frustrated and</font>

706
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,459
you start to take a lot of at home it

707
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:21,680
just it never get you never get better

708
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that it just kind of seems to add</font>

709
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">up or at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me it did saying</font>

717
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:45,889
somebody and they say it's against the

718
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:49,070
policy and there is no policy related to

719
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:51,710
that man<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't want to talk to that</font>

720
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:54,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy ever again like that that is a thing</font>

721
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:57,470
that kills<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop people you know</font>

722
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,000
i I've managed teams and I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

723
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,680
almost get to that where it's like they

724
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,680
come back to me and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I got</font>

725
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,990
this ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> request I I told them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

726
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,300
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this I'm like what we</font>

727
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,500
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we still need</font>

728
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have the full discussion or whether</font>

729
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,920
or not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing to do and</font>

730
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,630
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that it's against policy</font>

731
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,580
the next time you try to enforce

732
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,750
something that really is policy and the

733
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,000
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you try to make something</font>

734
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,130
policy you've lost ground already by

735
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">setting something was most policy off</font>

736
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,850
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of your head just to use it</font>

737
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,490
almost as a mechanic to end a ticket ER

738
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,649
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation so you know our</font>

739
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,150
policies are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable as I think</font>

740
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,140
Jim did a great job of pointing out in

741
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,670
the last talked don't minimize

742
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,870
it you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

743
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:42,370
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't read the full policy</font>

744
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,870
which I think users you know way high

745
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,129
percentage of them have never<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the</font>

746
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,810
formal security policy for an

747
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:50,350
organization I've worked at

748
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:54,280
organizations as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security engineer and</font>

749
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,929
I know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people did not read the</font>

750
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:02,110
security policies even within IT

751
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:04,720
security so avoid that as in outside if

752
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,510
you take one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing away from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and I</font>

753
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">hope that it's not limited to that but</font>

754
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,180
this is you know applicable across the

755
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,040
board don't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something policy unless</font>

756
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,620
it's written down<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actual policy that</font>

757
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,020
has been instituted and half<font color="#CCCCCC"> the times</font>

758
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,909
maybe policy isn't the best way I mean

759
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,670
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an important goal but a lot of our</font>

760
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,680
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in kind of a failed point</font>

761
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,730
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this kind of emphasizes things</font>

762
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,190
that are failed if there's something

763
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">important that isn't in the policy don't</font>

764
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:32,140
just say is policy go and try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

765
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,580
policy and then we kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talked about</font>

766
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,780
this already is just getting too focused

767
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,980
on the problems versus the solutions

768
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,560
problems are an easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> way sometimes the</font>

769
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,960
cell security at the ER at least to

770
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,879
solve the problem of security but not so

771
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">much the work of security all right if</font>

772
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,900
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say that 25 things are</font>

773
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,430
wrong the first thing a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

774
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,080
going to say is you know well what's the

775
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">right how do we actually keep from here</font>

776
00:30:53,080 --> 00:31:01,149
where do we go next give me a project

777
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:03,280
plan give me a to-do list and you know

778
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if you don't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

779
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,210
you you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead come back to him</font>

780
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,850
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 more problems the next week</font>

781
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,790
without having produced that that to-do

782
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,050
lists or that action list man you know

783
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:19,270
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get very far the</font>

784
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:21,070
next week either so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just kind</font>

785
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of reflections overall is you know the</font>

786
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,560
exact same skills that got me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

787
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">one level in my career you know up until</font>

788
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,649
essentially the the infrastructure

789
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,930
architect level<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had been a systems</font>

00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,310
engineer network<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineer and kind of</font>

791
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,860
crossing over between the two for

792
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:38,379
several years got more into developing

793
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,540
architectures and ended up as kind of an

794
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,670
infrastructure architect for a

00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,270
same suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that got me up to that</font>

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">level stop me from moving past that</font>

798
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,230
level because it was all very

799
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,620
these are the tech problems this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:56,200
tech solution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to in it</font>

801
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,879
helped in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say I know</font>

802
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,860
the best way to solve this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font>

803
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,360
the tools I had on hand let me work

within those tools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the job</font>

that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I stopped trying to</font>

like well I don't want him<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit it you</font>

know I never had a seat seat at the

817
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,340
you know you fall into that category

818
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,169
where you have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little influence on</font>

819
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:40,120
what you end up doing you know your

820
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:43,180
influences is based on how other people

work with the same colleagues long

854
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,210
enough to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that</font>

855
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,830
you know seek it out formally and

856
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,290
formally if it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation where</font>

857
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,509
you know in some ways you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get you</font>

858
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,279
know maybe three Jim beam's in and have

859
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,790
that real talk have that talk you know

860
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,169
any any feedback that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get on how</font>

861
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,359
you're perceived from other people

862
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:21,158
that's not a perspective by<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition</font>

863
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,739
you can have yourself without soliciting

864
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:29,319
it and it's it is your true identity in

865
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:30,939
the workplace and across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board the</font>

866
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:32,918
third one is we have an advantage here

867
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,109
it's much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to work on these</font>

868
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:37,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">things make these course corrections and</font>

869
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:40,690
develop this the soft<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills required to</font>

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,790
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence than it is for salesman to</font>

871
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:46,480
become technical experts because we've

872
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:48,779
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this as a passion for however</font>

873
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,760
long we've been doing it as a passion

874
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,649
people sell sometimes as a passion

875
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,109
usually to make money but those same

876
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:58,750
people kind of mutually exclusive have

877
00:34:56,109 --> 00:35:03,520
no tolerance for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nuts and bolts game</font>

878
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:05,050
of what we do by and large so i guess

879
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,349
the you know there's exceptions every

880
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,640
rule but my point here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

881
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do five things keep you know keep</font>

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,720
work through these these issues

00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:20,890
establishing influence they would have

885
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do hard research you know learn</font>

887
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:27,848
fall into the same traps<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know</font>

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,290
regardless of getting the the technical

00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:32,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">skills and building on that foundation</font>

890
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:36,460
of knowledge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we take to our jobs</font>

891
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,169
you don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be perfect I'm not</font>

892
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,260
suggesting that anybody could be or that

893
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:43,030
I think I am what I do think that I have

894
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,619
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is tried to be</font>

895
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:48,130
more reflective on what I've been doing

896
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:52,599
and come away from engagements not so

897
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:54,790
much I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> X but I did X in this way and</font>

898
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,059
I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was this effective here's</font>

899
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,440
where I stumbled here's people that

900
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,520
walked you know when I come away from

901
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,890
the gagement and it's clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

902
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,210
somebody I have ruffled up feather how

903
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,400
and why did I ruffle it you know

904
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,280
sometimes maybe I think it's unavoidable

905
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,559
to get to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> X but you do have to</font>

906
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,000
assess the path the critical you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

907
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,240
not just the critical path of getting

the

909
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,118
done but the complete view of a project

00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">in reflection and you know your career</font>

914
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:30,820
build your own data and review that data

915
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:34,210
and stay reflective on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> regardless of</font>

926
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,170
get frustrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to start to</font>

927
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,630
suck at the same job<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you loved and</font>

928
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,780
then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to go downhill and</font>

929
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:03,550
you see some people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for some</font>

people you know perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> I fall into this</font>

category you know a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing any one rule I feel like I've</font>

933
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,680
gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that point which is why</font>

934
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,980
consulting is a very good refreshing

935
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,669
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to move and keep some of that</font>

936
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,590
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of there but progress is important</font>

937
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,900
to our happiness and and it's you know

938
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:25,090
if you think you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take one job and be</font>

939
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:29,080
happy for for 25 years you know your

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique individual you know I can't</font>

942
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,810
and have that ambition and I think it's

943
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:39,580
a big part of happiness is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

944
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:42,310
get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next level there is it</font>

945
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:46,000
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me unfortunately after I did</font>

946
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:47,920
that and had that reflective moment or

947
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,750
fortunately I decided hey this would be

948
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,310
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great opportunity after I've learned</font>

949
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,100
some of the news soft skills to go back

950
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:56,380
to consulting I had been a consultant in

951
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,850
2002 2003 but more of a you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in</font>

952
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,350
those days there was enough people

953
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,960
building stuff that you could be kind of

954
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,100
the build guy go in just on engagements

955
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,230
and build something i didn't really

956
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,029
establish influence with anybody except

957
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,440
for the fact that it's like wow he can

958
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,540
he built that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shit out of that</font>

959
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,980
network you know let's let's bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

960
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,420
back to build something else never

961
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,310
really had any influence there but

962
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,250
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to more of a</font>

963
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:19,810
strategic consulting you know understand

964
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,910
the evolution of issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff like</font>

965
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,320
that and try to make some some real

966
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,940
changes after<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kind of had this</font>

967
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,980
reflection of part of the reasons why i

968
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,390
got a consulting in the first place

969
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,860
but yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's working six months</font>

970
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,210
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that review</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I door it before I</font>

971
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,370
left that position I had already

972
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,050
received a lot positive feedback

973
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:39,589
unsolicited from people that didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

974
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:41,210
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same review saying hey I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

the sudden he's trying to solve my

977
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:47,330
problems versus trying to stop me from

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing what I wanted to do that's a big</font>

shift it's essentially the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

980
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,330
from from what I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,800

new perspective on what I was trying to

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,910
going back fold back the layers and when

997
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,930
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets down to it it's usually</font>

998
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,160
something that you have a better

999
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,980
suggestion for that you can make that

1000
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,920
tactical win much better off with

1001
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,780
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> you maintain more influence</font>

1002
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,450
you keep people happy people see you as

1003
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:45,640
a problem solver versus a you know chief

1004
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:45,640
officer of no go fuck yourself big win

1005
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:50,330
so yeah and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like walking away</font>

1006
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:53,030
from from projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last you know</font>

1007
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:56,120
eight months I i feel like i have had

1008
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,770
when I have left I have changed

1009
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,299
something we you know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1010
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,800
project work I've done I've made some

1011
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,550
sort of impact on that business and

1012
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,900
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not that's just you know</font>

1013
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:08,300
bullshit or not I feel like I'm

1014
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,590
influencing decisions and organizations

1015
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,320
in a way that I wasn't able to do

1016
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:14,870
strictly from and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it with my</font>

1017
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,190
technology experience and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1018
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,569
in a way that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to benefit most</font>

1019
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,850
directly their technology and their

1020
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:23,360
infrastructure in their architecture but

1021
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:27,890
it's just I'm being listened to now and

1022
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:29,990
that's new for me you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

1023
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:33,040
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything I had on the list</font>

1024
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if there's any questions</font>

1025
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:48,370
question right thank you um I came in a

1026
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,560
little late so possibly i missed like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1027
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:54,370
beginning thesis but made a statement

1028
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,890
about how you don't want to be the guy

1029
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,390
doing the cool stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the cool</font>

1030
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,029
things in the cool room you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1031
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,740
the reasonable thing but sometimes might

1032
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,510
you want to be the cool guy making the

1033
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,580
cool stuff i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know i just i want to</font>

1034
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,950
make cool stuff yeah I absolutely i'm

1035
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,990
still in this by<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1036
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,779
mean if it were<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to me every other</font>

1037
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">project i did it would be some sort of</font>

1038
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,810
infrastructure build and stuff like that

1039
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,180
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do love the nuts and bolts of it as</font>

1040
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,549
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the next guy but from a career</font>

1041
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:25,060
perspective or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front from an overall</font>

1042
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,740
happiness perspective it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1043
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,720
the guy doing the cool stuff without

1044
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,759
doing the cool stuff over and over again

1045
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,230
until it becomes not cool stuff I want

1046
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,600
to be the guy that moves on to the next

1047
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:37,810
problem I can solve and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1048
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:40,120
hard to do that just by being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do</font>

1049
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,650
cool stuff really well I had to develop

1050
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,740
a new set of skills to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me to the</font>

1051
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:50,620
next bit of new cool stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1052
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:52,839
where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't do it yep so first</font>

1053
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,370
stuff you know good job it takes a lot

1054
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,230
of it takes a lot of guts to come up

1055
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,790
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say look I failed look this is</font>

1056
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,680
what I did that fails so good on that

1057
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,440
but to comment on something you had

1058
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,149
earlier was that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get</font>

1059
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of feedback from different people</font>

1060
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,810
and you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out what's</font>

1061
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,550
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what's going wrong you have to</font>

1062
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,009
be careful with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because that can</font>

1063
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of fail on you too you can be you</font>

1064
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:16,030
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change your perception because I did</font>

1065
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,529
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I learned that</font>

1066
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:19,390
that was a mistake you have to be very

1067
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:22,450
skillful and selective and the way you

1068
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:24,160
look for your feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I would</font>

1069
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:25,450
disagree i agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sediment of</font>

1070
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point but i would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all</font>

1071
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,109
feedback is helpful what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1072
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">is improve the way you can analyze</font>

1073
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:35,010
feedback and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to take</font>

1074
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:38,680
feedback you know this guy hates me

1075
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">maina is is not in it of itself useful</font>

1076
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,210
feedback to you so you may be tempted to

1077
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:45,070
avoid that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback but what if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

1078
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,110
it and you look at it with a better

1079
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,240
perspective and a better lens of what

1080
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,340
were your actions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1081
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,020
effect regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or not you</font>

1082
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,630
agree with the fact it doesn't matter

1083
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,790
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should always be looking at and</font>

1084
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,590
being honest with yourself enough and if

1085
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,210
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> another perspective of it</font>

1086
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:03,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully you have colleagues and</font>

1087
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:05,110
trusted people and to me you know my

1088
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,420
friends are a good sounding board when

1089
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">it comes to the point of they don't know</font>

1090
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,520
shit about unix linux anything but what

1091
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:14,830
they are good at is they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and</font>

1092
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:18,370
they know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could have possibly</font>

1093
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:19,750
done to make him say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font>

1094
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,850
i thought was inaccurate or something

1095
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:24,850
like that see I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> as much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback</font>

1096
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,830
as possible is good but we do have to be

1097
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:30,490
very careful about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we look at our</font>

1098
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:31,750
data in that respect and there's you

1099
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,160
know there's obviously stuff in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1100
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,330
packet you know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to a</font>

1101
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,410
certain point and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

1102
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:36,640
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at customer service</font>

1103
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,980
there's going to be comments in there

1104
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,250
that you know he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my</font>

1105
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,260
customers you know not true things that

1106
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,480
have come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my losing influence with</font>

1107
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:50,730
them in my affecting them in a way to

1108
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,800
start so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much feedback as</font>

1109
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:55,510
possible as good be careful in what

1110
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,940
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that feedback and how</font>

1111
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,760
yeah the changing what you're doing

1112
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,350
based on feedback those need to be very

1113
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,630
analyzed and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

1114
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,589
strategic and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be scientific</font>

1115
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,090
in the sense where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1116
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:09,250
change a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at once</font>

1117
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,810
you need to work on something see how

1118
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:13,180
it's improving it hold those variables

1119
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:15,279
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to solve</font>

1120
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:18,370
every problem you have on a political or

1121
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:21,630
social level overnight you need to you

1122
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:24,850
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> bake a theory based on some data</font>

1123
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:26,680
you know make some sort of metric to to

1124
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:29,049
figure out how you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine</font>

1125
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,029
you know how are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize</font>

1126
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's helping or not and then</font>

1127
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:35,860
execute on your plan if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

1128
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:37,509
improve anything and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

1129
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,970
like saying sorry or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1130
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:42,220
that you decided to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

1131
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:44,259
behavior standpoint revert it and look

1132
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,980
for a new solution that that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1133
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">work better for you</font>

1134
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:56,680
hi one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that over the</font>

1135
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,290
various companies I work for is that

1136
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,089
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big gap between you know the</font>

1137
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:03,430
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and the tech people</font>

1138
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:06,160
actually that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a decision to</font>

1139
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:09,359
you know yours back to go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> school</font>

1140
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,920
and to get a business<font color="#CCCCCC"> degree because I</font>

1141
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,520
noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we couldn't talk the same</font>

1142
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:18,550
language and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely agree in in</font>

1143
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:22,120
your presentation you said that we

1144
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:24,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aztecs should try to talk to the</font>

1145
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,589
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> people at their level and to</font>

1146
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:29,050
meet their needs but in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion</font>

1147
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,940
what do you think are we really trying

1148
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:33,370
hard enough because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still over the</font>

1149
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,170
years I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen that many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us don't</font>

1150
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:37,990
try to go that level<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we kind of</font>

1151
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:43,510
protect our own domain instead of trying

1152
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know get rash like I I i see that</font>

1153
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,870
exact same problem I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font>

1154
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself is over-exaggerated I think</font>

1155
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,040
that's an easy way for both business and

1156
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:53,050
occasionally tech people fall into it

1157
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,550
where they're saying you know the

1158
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,220
business is saying well tech<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

1159
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:59,440
understand what we're trying to do from

1160
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,450
a from a strategy perspective and then

1161
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,090
that what that is is that's the loss of

1162
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:06,910
influence technology has on the business

1163
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:08,470
people not business<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's itself not not</font>

1164
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,750
what we're trying to do because that's

1165
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,459
driven by the business people but the

1166
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,520
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> people no one won't want to</font>

1167
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,500
listen to tech in what they're good at

1168
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,540
which is technology in solving business

1169
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,700
problems with technology because you've

1170
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:24,460
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost that influence and that I</font>

1171
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the problem itself I'm not a</font>

1172
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:29,890
business you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a sales expert</font>

1173
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">I I could I understand the fundamental</font>

1174
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:34,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">principles of accounting and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side you</font>

1175
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">know but that's not my expertise but I</font>

1176
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:39,129
do work outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my box enough you</font>

1177
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,930
know to try to say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I understand</font>

1178
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,640
the objective I mean the objective<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

1179
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:45,399
is to make money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get new customers to</font>

1180
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,140
reach out to solve a roaming user you

1181
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,540
know to solve that problem of remote

1182
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,830
users those are very easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things to</font>

1183
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,090
understand and I think ninety-nine

1184
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:54,700
percent of the things we're doing our

1185
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,930
very simple to understand the parts that

1186
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,919
are required for technology to

1187
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,080
understand what the business is doing

1188
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason that we come to that butting</font>

1189
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,029
of heads and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business people saying</font>

1190
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,368
fuck technology those assholes don't

1191
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:07,800
listen to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because we on both sides</font>

1192
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:09,210
exaggerated that problem we exaggerated

1193
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,920
it because we don't want to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1194
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,589
so you know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to you and</font>

1195
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,910
says hey I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to improve sales in</font>

1196
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:16,859
this one right off the back you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1197
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:19,049
don't fucking tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're trying</font>

1198
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:21,808
to do on the business side that's not my

1199
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:23,450
area of expertise I code these lines and

1200
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:26,819
I developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> these firewall policies</font>

1201
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:28,558
we're extending that gap ourselves and

1202
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:30,630
we're trying to minimize the amount of

1203
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,819
inputs that that we need and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

1204
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:34,859
listen to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they have the</font>

1205
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:36,569
perfect opportunity to say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

1206
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:38,549
we're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones making money you're a</font>

1207
00:47:36,569 --> 00:47:40,109
cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center we haven't had a security</font>

1208
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,359
breach until we haven't had a security

1209
00:47:40,109 --> 00:47:44,819
breach in 10 years we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

1210
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,960
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your job or not frankly and</font>

1211
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:47,700
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge and</font>

1212
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,800
expertise to examine it and careful it

1213
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,598
carefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's when you start to</font>

1214
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,240
see the real business versus technology

1215
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,849
problem and I I have had a boss go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

1216
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,828
panel in and making an argument like

1217
00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:00,930
that in the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1218
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:02,280
I'm at fault for saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1219
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,328
understand the business as much as

1220
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,430
they're at fault for<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I don't</font>

1221
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:06,900
understand the business even when I

1222
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:10,759
think I understood enough of the

1223
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,760
business to do my<font color="#CCCCCC"> job appropriately oh</font>

1224
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:20,250
whatever start in the back all right

1225
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:21,808
yeah to your point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one of the</font>

1226
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:24,210
more valuable things I've done the last

1227
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:25,950
few years as an IT person consulting

1228
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,930
whatnot was taking a financial

1229
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:29,240
accounting class and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really helped</font>

1230
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:32,069
me understand that there are only a few

1231
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,200
fundamental things that businesses do is

1232
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:36,089
actually engage in they basically try to

1233
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,879
take resources at Valley to them and

1234
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:41,279
turn a profit and what we do is mostly

1235
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,960
an externality they don't they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1236
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,119
the business of<font color="#CCCCCC"> making their own carbon</font>

1237
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,890
paper they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even want to buy no</font>

1238
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,150
office supplies they don't need don't

1239
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,069
want routers they don't want to maintain

1240
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:52,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network they just want to sell shit</font>

1241
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:54,029
or mine coal or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they do and</font>

1242
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,339
sell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as fast as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and get rid</font>

1243
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:58,049
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah i agree with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in terms of</font>

1244
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:59,520
you should expand general foundational

1245
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:02,400
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> business understanding because</font>

1246
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,420
it's easy to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another thing is</font>

1247
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing is to</font>

1248
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,740
understand what your business is like I

1249
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:11,040
understand accounting that's great I

1250
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,959
understand you know accounting calm or

1251
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,740
whatever business i work for much better

1252
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,310
and much

1253
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:19,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're well easy to do still at a lot of</font>

1254
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:21,810
levels of getting to you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1255
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:23,520
just like we can distill security<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

1256
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:26,040
know ultimately you know maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Salters</font>

1257
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,420
1975 paper that has eight you know

1258
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,890
design principles of security if you

1259
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,240
look in there it's hard to comment on a

1260
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,129
situation that doesn't fall into one of

1261
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">those gaps you get that same set of</font>

1262
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:37,410
business principles from whoever wrote

1263
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:39,810
the 1901 paper on business I don't know

1264
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:42,750
who it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I haven't read it John</font>

1265
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:44,130
Locke perhaps but but you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same</font>

1266
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,680
perspective on the on the business side

1267
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,540
and I think you're in a good position to

1268
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,640
execute on the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of it I</font>

1269
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,860
feel like that that gap has been

1270
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,299
exaggerated on both ends because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font>

1271
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,250
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to deal with the bullshit of</font>

1272
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,140
business and they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to and</font>

1273
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,480
they extend the gap to say that you're

1274
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,830
not executing for us appropriately yeah

1275
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,270
I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't offer the right</font>

1276
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,670
technology if I don't understand the

1277
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,410
motivations for what they're actually

1278
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,940
trying to do in the end yeah that

1279
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,920
sometimes they come to you with a

1280
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">partial solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which is definitely a</font>

1281
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,130
sign where there's a it's a sign that

1282
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:16,109
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust you to come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1283
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution on your own so they say hey we</font>

1284
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,410
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play Citrix for these a</font>

1285
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:20,940
thousand users they don't come to you

1286
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,500
with the the requirement of saying hey

1287
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,510
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this app to work remotely for</font>

1288
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,980
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> users and that's also sign of you</font>

1289
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:27,330
having lost influence and<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust with an</font>

1290
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,609
organization when you start to see those

1291
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:31,259
parcel solutions role in because they

1292
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,690
don't think maybe you're agile enough to

1293
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,310
to get you know executed on a plan or

1294
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">something they try to start it at a</font>

1295
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:39,240
point that's you know nine-tenths of the

1296
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,190
way down the line and architecture

1297
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,020
development and say hey deal with this

1298
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:44,760
it might be right might not be right

1299
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:47,100
this is what the business demands of you

1300
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,340
I think we fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that gap because</font>

1301
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:52,470
we've already lost the influence there

1302
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:55,980
another question<font color="#E5E5E5"> what resources have you</font>

1303
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:57,689
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be useful in addressing the</font>

1304
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,119
problems you mentioned of developing

1305
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,109
appropriate levels of influence without

1306
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,660
getting the sand kicked in your face so

1307
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:05,160
that you can deliver useful solutions

1308
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,080
but actually you know get them to listen

1309
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,430
to those solutions what do you are their

1310
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,779
websites or the books are their

1311
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,980
associations what are you doing and

1312
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,460
where do you find the resources to get

1313
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:16,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">you there there there are you know for</font>

1314
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:19,470
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me it's that's why I'm consulting</font>

1315
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:20,790
right now is because I now you know

1316
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:22,439
establishing influence is a very

1317
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:23,640
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do if we take an</font>

1318
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Operations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> row we're going to be at a</font>

1319
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,609
company for a year you might have a

1320
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,140
couple

1321
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:29,489
to determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether or not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

1322
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have influence over the next two</font>

1323
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:35,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">years or not in a consulting role we do</font>

1324
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:37,349
that per project<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we go in and we</font>

1325
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:39,809
try to we maybe have a week or two to

1326
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:41,369
establish influence or not and we build

1327
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:42,749
on that in a very iterative approach

1328
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:44,249
just like we build on our other skills

1329
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:46,529
but I've mostly been doing it from a

1330
00:51:44,249 --> 00:51:48,868
skills perspective and you know

1331
00:51:46,529 --> 00:51:50,849
reflection I I haven't pursued and

1332
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:53,609
there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good resources out</font>

1333
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:55,079
there to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at I haven't pursued you</font>

1334
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:57,538
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't read any books on how to</font>

1335
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,009
establish influence from the perspective

1336
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:01,109
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Technology one of the reasons that I</font>

1337
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to do this talk is because I felt</font>

1338
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:08,519
just instinctively that there wasn't a

1339
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:09,599
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people having this discussion so</font>

1340
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:13,109
I work for a company that actually

1341
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,819
mandates<font color="#E5E5E5"> 360s every six months you work</font>

1342
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:17,609
for an<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome company in that respect</font>

1343
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:18,869
it can be it can also not be one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1344
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:20,249
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you bring up is that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1345
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you surveyed you've worked with for</font>

1346
00:52:20,249 --> 00:52:23,459
a great deal of time yes when you've

1347
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:25,140
worked with someone for six months and

1348
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,539
they're writing a review on you this can

1349
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,859
sometimes be skewed by what you've

1350
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:30,029
brought in when you come into an

1351
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:32,730
environment in the first place you

1352
00:52:30,029 --> 00:52:34,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned something where it's not often</font>

1353
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:36,720
where people are intentionally making

1354
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:38,669
bad choices they make a bad choice that

1355
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,950
simply evolves and grows into a much

1356
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:43,289
more fighters to clarify i think

1357
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:45,390
sometimes choices are left unmade and

1358
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:47,460
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my 100 but that's my major</font>

1359
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:49,019
point on that point is that sometimes

1360
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">people do not make a conscious decision</font>

1361
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:53,430
for something to turn into what it

1362
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,749
became and and when we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did</font>

1363
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,919
when we say that this person are

1364
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:57,779
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network and the</font>

1365
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,730
network sucks therefore they've decided

1366
00:52:57,779 --> 00:53:00,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a bad network we fall into one</font>

1367
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,160
of the issues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm talking about</font>

1368
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,569
well no but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fair to</font>

1369
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,160
criticize them for not making a choice

1370
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:06,930
in the first place not having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1371
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,359
insight to make a proper architecture is

1372
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:11,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">just as bad at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my opinion as</font>

1373
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">making a blatant choice to make the</font>

1374
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:15,989
network worse than it needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1375
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:19,288
and and but I don't disagree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1376
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:23,309
point that it's fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> I disagree with the</font>

1377
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:25,230
point that it's productive and in our

1378
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:26,489
professional careers the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1379
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:30,299
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> strive to do is be as productive</font>

1380
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:32,249
as possible I feel I mean to uh yes I i

1381
00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:33,630
think when in drinking with your friends

1382
00:53:32,249 --> 00:53:34,919
and stuff like that you can save Han

1383
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,930
look at what this asshole did at the end

1384
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the day it's good to digest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe</font>

1385
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,368
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of curves your frustration</font>

1386
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:43,299
factor

1387
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:45,220
venting through that but there's no time

1388
00:53:43,299 --> 00:53:46,900
machine in that network architecture so

1389
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,480
come to that with the approach of this

1390
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,029
network architecture can be improved by

1391
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:55,630
establishing you know tears or whatever

1392
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:58,029
the problem is here's why I think it has

1393
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,799
here's seven outage examples of

1394
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:02,200
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caused because</font>

1395
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:03,788
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one server connected to eight</font>

1396
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,069
networks and no network<font color="#CCCCCC"> topology</font>

1397
00:54:03,789 --> 00:54:08,970
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those those problems</font>

1398
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:11,319
use them as evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your solution or</font>

1399
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:14,348
suggest that they you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1400
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:15,940
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution out there I wouldn't you</font>

1401
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:17,019
know Tim's a jerk because he designed a

1402
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,670
bad network I don't think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1403
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:20,368
get you very far well no not that was

1404
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,990
really were always good i understand i'm

1405
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:25,299
being hyperbolic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm taking what you</font>

1406

<font color="#E5E5E5">said and being hyperbolic to prove a</font>

00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:28,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">point but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do understand what you're</font>

1409
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,599

1410
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,220
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a team of people</font>

1411
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,690
who in some cases have a very limited

1412
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:36,038
depth and background and they're being

1414
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,549

of them do in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases I cannot get</font>

1417
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,650
them to listen to ideas because they do

1418
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,569
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the technical depth to</font>

1419
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,999
understand the idea that I imposing in

1420
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:52,480
this case it is often<font color="#CCCCCC"> given that my</font>

1421
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:54,308
organization is a with bad reputation

1422
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,049
inside our entire organization do you

1423
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:58,089
have any advice on kind of working

1424
00:54:56,049 --> 00:54:59,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">within a large organization at odds with</font>

1426
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,730
another organization well the one thing

1427
00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:05,499
that jumped out at me and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a</font>

1428
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:07,180
solution everybody's problems the one

1429
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:09,069
thing that jumps out at me on that whole

1430
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,269
thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're we're assuming that</font>

1431
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:11,319
they're not listening to you because

1432
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,180
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the knowledge to know</font>

1433
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:14,558
you're right the reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font>

1434
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,649
not listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use because they don't</font>

1435
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:20,170
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any they don't know that</font>

1436
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right because they don't have</font>

1437
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">they don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that foundational</font>

1438
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:25,720
knowledge and you haven't established

1439
00:55:23,259 --> 00:55:28,359
trust an influence for them to trust

1440
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're right that's a much harder</font>

1441
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:33,640
thing to do because you can't make that

1442
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,739
on paper argument of a then B then C

1443
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:39,730
then d you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

1444
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:41,019
time take a very upfront approach to

1445
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,369
develop you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know working with them to</font>

1446
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:43,899
develop the required skills that you

1447
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:46,390
think it is that are necessary to

1448
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,190
understand your arguments at first but i

1449
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:51,790
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are situations</font>

1450
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:54,340
where somebody has no idea that

1451
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:56,890
decision I've made is right but they can

1452
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:59,170
take what I have contributed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my</font>

1453
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:01,060
do you know my job was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer my</font>

1454
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,320
opinion on that and they can trust that

1455
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,850
opinion whether or not they have the

1456
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,230
nuts and bolts behind it to know that I

1457
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:08,589
was right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what I've been</font>

1458
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:10,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on improving not so much I mean</font>

1459
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:12,400
the education<font color="#CCCCCC"> factor is HUGE if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1460
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:14,800
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in technical roles they need</font>

1461
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,900
to start building<font color="#CCCCCC"> those education and</font>

1462
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,790
the you know going way back to the very

1463
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,830
first question<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had the part about</font>

1464
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:23,290
the this every six months feedback in it

1465
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:25,180
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes not useful to you that</font>

1466
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,860
knowing what's useful and what's not is

1467
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,629
that discriminatory I I think it's great

1468
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">but although it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1469
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:33,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">time-consuming maybe six months is not a</font>

1470
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,779
great time<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room or maybe something</font>

1471
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,240
like a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something like that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1472
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,100
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is good from the sense that you</font>

1473
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,870
get a lot of data you can kind of pick

1474
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,069
and choose what to do with it eventually

1475
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,240
if somebody has been there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

1476
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,920
years and you've been there for five

1477
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,319
years their data is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start to be</font>

1478
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:51,330
valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than you know</font>

1479
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:55,030
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who doesn't like you for some</font>

1480
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:58,000
prejudicial reason or anything else yep

1481
00:56:55,030 --> 00:57:00,130
all right so um I've been freelancing

1482
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,910
for about a year and i would say in the

1483
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:05,260
last month i started<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting bites the</font>

1484
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:09,910
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is because</font>

1485
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:12,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">i switched from I think this this to go</font>

1486
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:15,129
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept of influence where I</font>

1487
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:16,770
think that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of has tendrils I can</font>

1488
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:19,260
reach out to different things like

1489
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:21,670
influence could entirely depend on

1490
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,430
verbiage used and language used in

1491
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,570
communication where a equals 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> B equals</font>

1492
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:27,940
to stuff like that where you tell

1493
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:30,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody yeah you're running a cisco</font>

1494
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,540
with the 10 base-t that you know

1495
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:34,090
interface and you're plugging into a

1496
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:37,870
gige port with 400,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> people the other</font>

1497
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:39,010
side you're going to have trouble where

1498
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,880
it's translating that something like

1499
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:41,320
you're not using the right equipment

1500
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,400
here's what you should be using and

1501
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,990
provide a link or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that</font>

1502
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,380
it's a whole different this night<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1503
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:49,660
day um so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what your</font>

1504
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">thoughts were on basically giving away a</font>

1505
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:54,970
ton of free work if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean cuz you</font>

1506
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:57,280
know if you value your time like i bill

1507
00:57:54,970 --> 00:58:01,299
at X dollars an hour how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours do I</font>

1508
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,480
spend giving away free work as opposed

1509
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,590
you know right spending my time

1510
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,630
essentially getting nothing sort

1511
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:12,310
like a fish hook in the water like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1512
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">example my well my Zach scenario is is I</font>

1513
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,190
didn't start getting any bites at all

1514
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:18,610
until I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube of how to</font>

1515
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:20,470
exploit an XP to host from an ipod so

1516
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:23,830
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit yeah also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never he</font>

1517
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:26,379
wants to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me yeah I I think and I</font>

1518
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:29,890
touched on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this briefly but in a lot of</font>

1519
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:32,920
situations we have to trade tactical

1520
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:34,330
improvements for influence and whether

1521
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,280
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you can you know as far as the</font>

1522
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:38,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">Billings concerned if there are one hour</font>

1523
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,630
to hour thing if you're already engaged

1524
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,040
on a project with them it's one thing to

1525
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of lump that into the work</font>

1526
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,120
you're doing or something like that you

1527
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:47,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to help that's a lot</font>

1528
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:50,500
more valuable to them to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to help</font>

1529
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:52,359
and may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once you try to</font>

1530
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,880
go through you know developing a salad

1531
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,970
to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's not what people</font>

1532
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,380
want people want hey here's a very quick

1533
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,700
tactical improvement and you're

1534
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,200
exchanging that for influence and I

1535
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,960
wouldn't say it is it's giving away your

1536
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,609
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> your you're up in the odds of you</font>

1537
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:11,320
being successful in other opportunities

1538
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:12,490
by a lot so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it starts get to I mean</font>

1539
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,290
if you it's a riorca tech chure

1540
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:15,640
something or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that you</font>

1541
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:17,080
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at other ways to</font>

1542
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,210
sell the work you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1543
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,680
figure out things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think at one</font>

1544
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:23,110
level there's there's a lot of situation

1545
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,790
where boils down to one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours of</font>

1546
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:27,010
tactical commentary or something like

1547
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:29,620
that and I think that's good a good way

1548
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:31,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get ahead in the game of quickly</font>

1549
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,839
establishing influence of people if

1550
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:36,280
you're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give that your</font>

1551
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,080
experience to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation that you see</font>

1552
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,810
happening tangential to what you're

1553
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,840
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that helps them then they look</font>
