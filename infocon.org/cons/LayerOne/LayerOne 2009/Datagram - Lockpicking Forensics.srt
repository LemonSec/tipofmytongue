so before we actually begin taping this

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,870
whole talk is gonna be ridiculous and

4

lock-picking forensics I'm DG and that's

8
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,330
all the intro you're gonna get normally

9
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,979
I don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you shout stuff out and</font>

10
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask questions but we really don't have</font>

11
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,770
time and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ruin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the SQL</font>

12
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,580
guys talk because I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font>

to see it so Q&A afterwards if i'm not

14
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,810
busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the SQL talk first we're going</font>

15
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,370
to go over real quick how locks and

16
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,690
picks work that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

17
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,770
introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give so</font>

18
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,550
hopefully you're at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock-picking</font>

used to that because that'll be

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,130
happening for the next hour how many of

22
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with how locks and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">picking on a basic level works how many</font>

24
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,210
how many of you went to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> village the</font>

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,220
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you were suckers right just</font>

26

kidding we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through that</font>

27
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,920
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at normal wear on</font>

28
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:58,310
the lock because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,880
question what and the talk goes downhill

30
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,840
from here<font color="#E5E5E5"> after all the Guinness show up</font>

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,869
we're gonna look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at normal wear and how</font>

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,929
normal use effects locks and keys we're

33
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,399
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to then analyze locks for forensic</font>

34
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,080
evidence of quite a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

35
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,330
attacks when you look at keys for the

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,310
same thing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end if we have time</font>

37
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,239
we'll go through the general

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,860
investigative processes as it relates to

39
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:26,620
forensic locksmithing it call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a mess</font>

40
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:28,760
to get of locksmithing before we begin

41
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,160
before we<font color="#CCCCCC"> begin you should know this</font>

42
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,019
talk isn't going to have any destructive

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,180
entry stuff only because a we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

44
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">time but be I don't find it as as</font>

45
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,379
interesting as all the covert stuff it's

46
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:43,458
<font color="#E5E5E5">really obvious when somebody is kicked</font>

47
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:45,500
in your door<font color="#CCCCCC"> blown</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up your door but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

48
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,810
in these cases we need to consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe it was just used as a way to hide</font>

50
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,760
the actual method of entry but it's just

51
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,839
something to keep in mind and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

52
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,519
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my best works right there how</font>

53
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,019
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know how locks work like can</font>

54
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,630
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> skip this and save my minutes how</font>

55
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:06,470
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you don't know how locks work</font>

56
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:10,579
man how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you don't know how</font>

57
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock-picking works real quick crash</font>

58
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,760
course and lock picking that's how the

59
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:15,410
lock looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the outside that's</font>

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,810
called a pin tumbler lock that's what we

61
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,720
use for our examples it's the absolute

62
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,099
most popular lock worldwide and it's

63
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much everywhere in this building</font>

64
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,780
everywhere you work<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere you live</font>

65
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:29,060
inside it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pairs of</font>

66
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,310
pins top pin bottom pin and a spring on

67
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,560
top to push them down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

68
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,630
is that normally they all sit here<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,609
blue pins all block that inner peace

70
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,739
from rotating when you use the key the

71
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:41,540
key raises those to the right position

72
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:48,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that they could split and that inner</font>

73
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:51,349
peace can rotate<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay pay attention so</font>

74
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:56,870
these amazing lock tunes are all thanks

75
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:58,940
to deviant so just real quick so that's

76
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,739
how it works and in a real lock there's

77
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,019
a series of pins it's not just this one

78
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,989
stack<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's traditionally five sometimes</font>

79
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,130
four six seven and they're all raised to

80
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,549
the right height like in our last

81
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,230
picture so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way lock-picking works is</font>

82
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,169
that we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that pin chambers</font>

83
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,000
are drilled all together and that when

84
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,410
we rotate that inner peace we're hitting

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,970
all of them at once and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the animation</font>

86
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,729
you can see them jiggling just a little

87
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,770
bit what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happens is that either</font>

88
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,219
the pin chambers are off the pins are

89
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,349
off pins are oval the chambers are oval

90
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,080
there's various manufacturing defects

91
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:35,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> caused in the animation just that</font>

92
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,070
third panel hit first for whatever

93
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,320
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will that will happen is</font>

94
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,860
it's not really important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us how it</font>

95
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,210
happens

96
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,310
that it happens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what makes</font>

97
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock-picking work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really hope this</font>

98
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,710
next animation doesn't crash it I don't

99
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,318
know why it does okay that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

100
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,789
an animation but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we pick a</font>

101
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,229
lock is we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use a tool to</font>

102
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,759
applied tension normally when you use

103
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,530
the key you're rotating the key and

104
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,419
that's your attention point we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

105
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,698
to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one pan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's binding in</font>

106
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,469
as in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous slide we're going to</font>

107
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">raise that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pin pair so that it can split</font>

108
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,740
at the right position like the key does

109
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:08,629
and then we're going to repeat that that

110
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,340
process for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of them as we're</font>

111
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing this the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tension tool is holding</font>

112
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,779
all the pins that we split at the right

113
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,189
height if we get them there and once

114
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:18,259
they're all is right height the lock

115
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:22,460
opens and this is the animation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

116
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:24,139
worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll break it all right ok so</font>

117
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,090
we insert our tool that's a tension tool

118
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,009
the pic comes in he's looking for the

119
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">binding pin and so those two were loose</font>

120
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:31,909
but that one wasn't and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,758
binding pin our tension to holds it up

122
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:37,370
we go through find the others and that's

123
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,240
the other binding pin and now that one

124
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,340
and now that one and the lock opens and

125
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,779
so that's that's is very simple locks &

126
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,419
themselves for very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font>

127
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:50,900
how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's how basic lock</font>

128
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,330
picking is done so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of forensic</font>

129
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,210
locksmithing is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times at the</font>

130
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,609
cons and I'm more than guilty of this is

131
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,219
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people kind of portray</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lock-picking</font>

132
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,599
is this on you can't find out that your

133
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:05,900
lock was picked and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside</font>

134
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:08,150
that's absolutely true in most cases as

135
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,799
well as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> other techniques but there's</font>

136
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,599
this idea of forensic locksmithing and

137
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,330
it started in nineteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventy six with</font>

138
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,659
gentleman named art<font color="#CCCCCC"> pahokee he was of</font>

139
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Chicago PD and he decided you know</font>

140
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,680
what I'm gonna do a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> shit two</font>

141
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,779
locks and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know test</font>

142
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,699
various levels aware on keys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

143
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:27,529
internals and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

144
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,529
how I can tell which techniques were

145
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:33,620
used and how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify tool suspects</font>

146
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,900
trace evidence he's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the father of</font>

147
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,210
this by all accounts and so you could

148
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:42,409
see that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1976 that's over 30 years</font>

149
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,938
ago yeah 30 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and so it's been</font>

150
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:46,310
around for a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll find</font>

151
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:51,680
there's almost no public resources on

152
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:54,050
this until I made a site so the really

153
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> English resource is this book</font>

154
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,949
Lock safes and security by<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tobias</font>

156
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:03,169
conferences it's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

157
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,789
book on locks and lock-picking and that

158
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:08,628
sort of thing but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very expensive</font>

159
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:10,580
you can technically by specific sets of

160
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:15,379
chapters for cheap but the book itself

161
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:17,300
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to 250 200 just for the basic</font>

162
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:19,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">version and then 400 for a locksmith</font>

163
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,199
version and 800 for a government version

164
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,360
but if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in this this</font>

165
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,669
is absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best book you can buy</font>

166
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,009
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not worth in my opinion buying a</font>

167
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,419
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> $80 book on just general</font>

168
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:32,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock-picking when you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just buy</font>

169
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:35,719
this and get I think it's like 30,000

170
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:38,810
pages as well as audio and video it's

171
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:41,780
insane<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so big he can't even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font>

172
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">in print anymore the full book it's</font>

173
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,508

174
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:48,440
versions are in fact multimedia so

175
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,780
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the book you can buy the</font>

176
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,280
forensics chapters i think for 60 bucks

177
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,419
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good if you want to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

178
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,679
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think if you're that</font>

179
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,659
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you might as well just</font>

180
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">buy the whole book there's a German</font>

181
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:00,259
fellow and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how to pronounce</font>

182
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,509
his last name so I won't try but that

183
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,889
book translated means tool traces and

184
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,169
it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be excellent it's</font>

185
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:08,270
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best or</font>

186
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,490
actually probably the only book that

187
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,830
specifically deals with forensic

188
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,690
locksmithing but it's in German so I

189
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,190
can't read it so I can't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if it</font>

190
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,130
truly is amazing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does have</font>

191
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,110
amazing pictures because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he uses is much</font>

192
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,479
better equipment than I do there's also

193
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,479
this book impressionnant I Oliver

194
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,699
dietrichson it's normally in German you

195
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,800
could buy a translated version it's kind

196
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,930
of the translations a little bad but

197
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,820
it's actually a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good book and the</font>

198
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,328
guy who wrote the tool traces book does

199
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,979
it short like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 page section on</font>

200
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:41,539
forensics of impressionen using the

201
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,159
really awesome equipment that makes all

202
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,290
my pictures look really bet look really

203
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,930
bad so the role of the forensic

204
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,269
locksmith in modern days to determine a

205
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,989
method of entry how somebody could have

206
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:55,459
got into somewhere they identify

207
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,800
specific evidence tool marks the

208
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,689
techniques used they could go on to

209
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,160
provide information about the skill

210
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,350
level of attackers the number of

211
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,589
attackers that the time it might have

212
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,370
taken to do the entry how expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

213
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,630
would have been

214
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,810
special tools would have been required

215
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:14,660
and all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is given to police or</font>

216
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,390
insurance companies or you know whoever

217
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,430
hires them to look at their locks and it

218
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,699
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even necessarily need a crime it</font>

219
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,910
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be that an agency wants to</font>

220
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,260
evaluate their security or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

221
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,180
they don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's crime but</font>

222
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,400
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for insurance reasons look</font>

223
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,050
at the internals of the locks to

224
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,089
determine if anything's been attempted

225
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,740
or done against them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the last thing</font>

226
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they do that's pretty important is</font>

227
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,850
they provide expert testimony in a lot

228
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the criminal or insurance things is</font>

229
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,730
they'll they'll eventually go on to to

230
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,370
push out as they push this sounds bad

231
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,430
but they'll explain their findings and

232
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,290
in a lot of cases just them<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing a</font>

233
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,479
report before they even need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> testify</font>

234
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">will just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end that lawsuit right away</font>

235
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,950
either they'll pay out or some some

236
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,410
party you'll just give up because it's

237
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">really hard to argue with such you know</font>

238
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">damning evidence like that you can't be</font>

239
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,470
like no that guy doesn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he's</font>

240
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,180
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> no but it does happen so</font>

241
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,140
sometimes they do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

242
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:17,930
do expert or even civilian testimony so

243
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:23,029
that's what that is before we look at

244
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:25,550
how all the techniques work we'll look

245
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,910
at how locks look new as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as to</font>

246
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,650
various states where I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to know</font>

247
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,000
medico nice companies they all do this

248
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,829
with a really cool machine that goes

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,260
cheap of cheap gucci would she with a

250
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,520
key to simulate where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this all by</font>

251
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:43,310
hand because<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a machine and</font>

252
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">B it seems much more realistic and it</font>

253
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,520
was

254
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,769
some of the complaints with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines</font>

255
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,540
or that they're too perfect and they

256
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:54,120
don't simulate when you're drunk and you

257
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,980
miss or when you push it to the side too

258
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,589
far and it is important and it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

259
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,199
an effect on where but the statistics

260
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,389
are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of no one really cares about if</font>

261
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:05,878
it's going to work a million times or 25

262
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:08,370
million times that sort of thing but

263
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:10,410
here's what a pin looks like new and

264
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,170
this was an in our previous animation

265
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,029
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom pin it's rounded you</font>

266
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,009
can see the milling marks it's very

267
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:21,569
distinct there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> scratches no dents</font>

268
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:23,550
it looks new right that's what a key

269
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:25,170
looks like new and this is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

270
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,819
specify all these things are brass and

271
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,019
that's the most common thing there's

272
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,748
different materials but we don't have

273
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we'll just stick with brass key</font>

274
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:35,189
looks do and that's the factory original

275
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,069
key probably only been used five or six

276
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:41,040
times so pretty much knew you'll see

277
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:43,579
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no real big marks it looks okay</font>

278
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,230
it looks fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> smooth as far as keys go</font>

279
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:48,388
the plug that the inner part of the lock

280
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,220
that rotates also looks pretty new no

281
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:53,910
scratches just the milling marks just

282
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:57,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the broaching marks a pin after a</font>

283
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,839
hundred uses of turning putting the key

284
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:01,889
in turning it completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> and removing it</font>

285
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,089
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enjoy this as we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go on</font>

286
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:07,620
is that it's basically gently rubbing

287
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:10,769
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of those pins as it</font>

288
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:14,699
raises it that mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I have a</font>

289
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:17,129
close up I do that mark is actually the

290
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:18,689
the key slightly polishing and removing

291
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:21,959
those milling marks and you can see my

292
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:23,279
mouse right here it's starting to do

293
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,819
that and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> milling marks becoming</font>

294
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,649
less less profound and in the previous

295
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:30,420
one farther away you can see that's also

296
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,370
lubricant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's depositing and brass</font>

297
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,329
is self lubricating so it's helping to

298
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,209
do that I think don't quote me and edit

299

301
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,730
these marks where those top pins were

302
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:46,349
rubbing against it as its rotating it's

303
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,610
not too much of a thing on where but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

304
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,829
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd include it because it's</font>

306
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:54,750
pretty pretty different the black line

307
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,329
is the lubricate lubricate Jesus

lubricant in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the key and</font>

309
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:59,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see it's only in the middle</font>

310
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only place</font>

311
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,960

312
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,880
very light<font color="#E5E5E5"> crevices starting to be made</font>

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:14,280
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,500 uses that's right by hand it</font>

314
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:17,030
gets better after 1,500 uses this is the

315
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:21,439
first pin in and can anybody tell me

316
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:23,459
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll wait for a Q&A ridiculousness</font>

317
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,690
so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the million marks</font>

318
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,190
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much gone almost all of them</font>

319
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,900
there's a little light scratching that's

320
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">caused by the key also getting worn down</font>

321
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,550
becoming more jagged in certain areas

322
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,550
but most of our milling marks are gone

323
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:40,260
this is pin 5 why does pin 5 look a lot

324
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:42,089
different than pin 1 that's correct he

325
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,150
said less bumps going past it and what

326
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,980
he means is the pin 5 is only touched by

327
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,230
the very tip of the pen but pin one

328
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,780
rides the entire length of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key as</font>

329
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,860
it's being inserted soap in five is

330
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,170
going to have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> less wear and you'll</font>

331
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,880
also notice there's a lot more scratches

332
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,979
and that's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same reason is the</font>

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,140
tip of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key will have the most we're</font>

334

on the key and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be the most jag and</font>

335
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most uneven and so it's also</font>

336
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:08,250
scratching it like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500 uses</font>

337
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,380
this is real close up of the key you'll

338
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,820
see that it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot worse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

339
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,920
crevices are a lot bigger a lot more

340
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,510
lubricants deposited and that's what's

341
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,780
contributing to those scratches on that

342
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">back pin the plug also continues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wear</font>

343
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:25,140
more staggering of the lubricant more

344
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,820
we're at five thousand uses almost all

345
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,560
of our milling marks are gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> on pin one</font>

346
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,250
it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know completely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> polished</font>

347
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,380
for the most part pin 5 continues to

348
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,660
wear down but it also develops this oval

349
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:40,590
sometimes a looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a figure eight</font>

350
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,959
shape and that's because normally pins

351
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,340
12 for most of the front pins as we

352
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,660
insert the key they're being rotated

353
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,510
back and forth and spinning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and spinning</font>

354
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,250
and so the wear distributes evenly but

355
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that back pin is only getting touched by</font>

356
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,120
the tip of the key so it's not getting

357
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that full range of rotation that all the</font>

358
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,540
other ones normally get so develops<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

359
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:03,360
kind of odd that they were locking us in

360
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,890
this is a odd weird oval shape and you

361
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,330
can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still quite a</font>

362
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,540
few milling marks it's a lot different

363
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,550
than almost all the other pins five

the plug after<font color="#E5E5E5"> five thousand uses and</font>

this one's interesting how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

every one of you has done it you just

you're off by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit a lot of</font>

373
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,550
you'll notice there's a mark and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

most<font color="#CCCCCC"> pinned doubler keys or shoulder</font>

376
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,980
of the key where you hold it is what

377
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,200
stops it from going in<font color="#E5E5E5"> farther so after</font>

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,560
develop these pretty deep crevices and

386
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,660
that's contributing to some lights light

scratching<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the the internals of the</font>

that's pretty standard you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

them as well as possibly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cam on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

426
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,479
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot of people put the pic</font>

427
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,020
in too far it's very amateur thing

428
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,970
sometimes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

429
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,129
them on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of the plug but I</font>

430
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,200
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's kind of hard to tell</font>

431
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,420
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw how normal use is</font>

432
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,430
and it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really identify what's</font>

433
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,070
a key hitting into it and what's a pic

434
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,620
hitting into it so that's what it looks

435
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:46,210
like and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom pin and it's</font>

436
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:49,479
very clearly not normal use and it's not

437
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">just this one this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lock that's been</font>

438
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,500
picked once and these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all five</font>

439
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,360
tumblers if i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not mistaken so here's</font>

440
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,760
another one again similar a little

441
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,459
different of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course unique but it's</font>

442
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,830
still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same again still the same the</font>

443
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,100
marks are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit different but</font>

444
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,659
still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same here again lighter but</font>

445
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,760
you could still very clearly see it's

446
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,800
not normal wear and this is the back

447
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,950
panag n we know this because it has the

448
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,020
least wear but it also the single marks

449
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,610
indicate single pin picking there's

450
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,170
different techniques the previous ones

451
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,699
look more like they were raked or

452
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,380
something was gently rubbed across them

453
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:28,570
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one looks like it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

454
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:32,029
clearly lifted individually now often we

455
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:34,580
can tell the skill level of the attacker

456
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:37,219
or at least estimate it in the case of

457
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,468
lock-picking so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see this is</font>

458
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:41,629
very scary it's a nightmare on<font color="#E5E5E5"> elm</font>

459
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:44,899
street as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock-picking forensics</font>

460
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:46,459
goes you see very very deep gashes very

461
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:49,330
numerous gashes you almost can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

462
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,710
see what the normal pain looks like

463
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:55,668
here's an example of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very skilled</font>

464
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,799
attacker now there are still marks

465
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,539
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very light but you can see them</font>

466
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:03,408
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I point them out or can you guys</font>

467
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:05,869
see them so here's one here's some more

468
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:08,419
we could also<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the sides</font>

469
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:11,029
which is we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it to next that are</font>

470
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:13,339
more defined but we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

471
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:15,440
so is it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could just be</font>

472
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:19,639
very careful it's very hard not to make

473
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,200
marks while using traditional pics so

474
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:22,248
the sides of the of the pins<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're also</font>

475
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,269
going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember we're lifting</font>

476
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:29,479
between pin stacks to raise middle pins

477
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:31,309
in this example you see some marks where

478
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:33,200
my mouse<font color="#E5E5E5"> go right here right here and</font>

479
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's very hard not to leave these marks</font>

480
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,849
it's very possible that you might get

481
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:40,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">lucky</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like in this last slide and leave</font>

482
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:41,928
very few marks on the bottom but leaving

483
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:46,509
not leaving marks on the sides is very

484
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:46,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">very hard here's more they're very light</font>

485
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:50,419
here's more and these are quite high up

486
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:53,809
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not going to be caused by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

487
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:55,369
pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric excuse me a key because</font>

488
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,509
obviously we saw what a key looks like

489
00:19:55,369 --> 00:20:00,649
and the key wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do these very</font>

490
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:02,450
distinct very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small scratches the side</font>

491
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:04,129
of the pins also tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a lot about the</font>

492
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,929
skill level<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacker in the same way</font>

493
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:07,728
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually from the same</font>

494
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:09,919
lock is that other one it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

495
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:12,169
random lock I got that I decided to do

496
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,879
some forensics on before I did anything

497
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,099
to it and it happened to be picked a

498
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,259
hell and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see compared to the</font>

499
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:20,899
last ones these marks are quite deep

500
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,580
very deep more so<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the need to be</font>

501
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:24,649
this indicates that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using way</font>

502
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,330
too much tension and that's causing them

503
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:29,899
to use a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> force with their pic</font>

504
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,939
to raise pin stacks it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that</font>

505
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:33,978
as they're doing this they're scraping

506
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,080
out a lot of material from that we could

507
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:38,509
get pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to mark analysis to</font>

508
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,099
determine if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whoever's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pic did</font>

509
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:44,239
that because it's very clearly the

510
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:45,980
thickness of the pic right the plug is

511
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:47,809
also one of the best place

512
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,299
is to get information the plug is that

513
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:52,790
internal peace that you're inserting

514
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:55,190
your pic into so the top of the plug a

515
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,899
very top channel of it nothing ever

516
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,250
touches<font color="#CCCCCC"> key should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never touch it</font>

517
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">because if it did it couldn't be</font>

518
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,540
inserted into lock because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be too</font>

519
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,250
big and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pins don't touch</font>

520
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,559
it because it's between the pin chambers

521
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,290
as you could see so here you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

522
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,879
very distinct scratching that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

523
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,889
generally not be considered normal use

524
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,419
and with the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dirt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and corrosion</font>

525
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could also see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that those are pretty</font>

526
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:20,169
fresh so you can also you know do

527
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,790
sophisticated lab stuff to determine

528
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:24,110
like oxidation tests and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

529
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,780
forth determine when these marks were

530
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,360
made the inside of the plugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

531
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,570
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few marks that won't be at all</font>

532
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">consistent with use of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a key obviously</font>

533
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,629
when we use key<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just going in and</font>

534
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,610
out and it's straight it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these</font>

535
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,290
weird angles like some of these are so

536
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,659
it can never be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key that's making</font>

537
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:45,049
these marks obviously a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of scratches</font>

538
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,520
the angle of attack well attack an angle

539
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:48,400
of them tool mark doesn't make sense

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a key very clearly</font>

542
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:53,629
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock and again we could try and</font>

543
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this to do a tool-mark</font>

545
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,330
some material in here and we can link it

546
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,210
back to suspects tools if they're found

547
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,620
the pin chambers themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have</font>

548
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,480
quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

549
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,918
obviously the keys never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch</font>

550
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,450
those or else it wouldn't be able to

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,240
come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the lock if it's if</font>

it's chunking off all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this material pins</font>

553
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,419
aren't going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because if they</font>

554
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:20,360
did do it they'd be scraping the entire

length of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the chamber wherever</font>

00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">olney on the other side of the lock</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cutaway there's these in the middle of</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chambers there's this gauge on that</font>

560

left one if you compare it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

561
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:34,879
right one it's pretty distinctly

562
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,590
different and if a key was doing this

563
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,990
then the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be doing it on all</font>

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,299
those marks up until where the keys

565
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,980
supposed to stop right it wouldn't just

566
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:46,850
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one in the middle it's just not</font>

567
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,350
possible here's a close-up and for my

568
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,719
money that's actually a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

569
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:55,189
mark you know you can see the angle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

570
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,900
it it's very deep very very easy to

571
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,570
determine the thickness of whatever made

572
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,870
it possibly left some material I call

573
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,050
the other

574
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:07,129
stuff up in the pin chamber is even

575
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:10,149
higher we can also find marks now can

576
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,150
anybody tell me what this looks like

577
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:19,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well it's clearly a scratch but</font>

578
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:25,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">what would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made that and don't say</font>

579
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,210
a pic no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I mean what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would action</font>

580
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:36,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">clothes other other orientation not cite</font>

581
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:38,420
not raising the pic thank you it's very

582
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,860
clearly that person's is trying to pick

583
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,150
that and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for the shear</font>

584
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,740
line of that pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> stack so they're</font>

585
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,600
raising up and down up and down trying

586
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find it that's very high in the lock</font>

587
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,879
so we could look is that pin in the lock

588
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,730
later when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> disassemble it is that pin</font>

589
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,490
I guess it's already disassembled huh is

590
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin supposed to be that high you</font>

591
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,990
know maybe it's way too high than what

592
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,070
they were trying so again that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

593
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,929
help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine the skill level</font>

594
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">because a lot of people when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

595
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:07,790
picking amateurs they'll just go but

596
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,550
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily where the pin</font>

597
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:18,170
stacks are supposed to be do you keep

598
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:19,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">laughing cuz he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knows it's true yeah we</font>

599
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,070
can also definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> find the tension</font>

600
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,170
tools and another beginner mistake is

601
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,990
too much tension and really most things

602
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:28,850
require feather touch this I didn't even

603
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to cut apart to see how clear that</font>

604
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,520
that mark is where's my right here very

605
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,490
clear line from where<font color="#CCCCCC"> that tension tool</font>

606
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,400
binds<font color="#E5E5E5"> up against the plug if we cut it</font>

607
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,140
apart we could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better better tool</font>

608
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
mark here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see these are</font>

609
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,370
scratches how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have have</font>

610
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,530
picked a lot for the tension tool how

611
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,820
many of you have had to jiggle<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

612
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,760
tension tool around to get it seated

613
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,530
right all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same people right that's</font>

614
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,300
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> those scratches are that's them</font>

615
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,720
trying to find where it is and then

616
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally they settle on right here and</font>

617
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,780
that's where the tension tool was

618
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:07,490
finally placed sometimes that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so</font>

619
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,889
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's because again</font>

620
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,170
light tension is more of a skilled

621
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,210
attacker thing and it's more proper to

622
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,679
do against the vast

623
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:19,120
blocks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even without really i forgot</font>

624
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say all of this talk is done with</font>

625
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,549
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty dollar Chinese digital</font>

626
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,590
microscope so it's not you don't need to

627
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">be CSI to do this just the right</font>

628
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,428
lighting and you can catch all those

629
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,699
same wiggle marks right you can also

630
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:40,779
catch right here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that tool</font>

631
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,570
placement mark right the back of the

632
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:45,340
lock the cam the tailpiece uh something

633
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:50,049
the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> should never touch almost never</font>

634
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:52,059
unless it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or if it's a</font>

635
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">backstop key which is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not popular</font>

636
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:56,200
with pin tumblers you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here</font>

637
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,549
very clearly a big scratch and what's

638
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of cool about this example is that</font>

639
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of rust so you could</font>

640
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,520
pretty easily do an oxidation comparison

641
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,140
between those two areas to determine

642
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,629
when that make when that mark was<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

643
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,240
made that's not something that the

644
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">forensic locksmiths will do usually part</font>

645
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,370
it out to you know the criminology lab

646
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:20,260
whoever you're working with if this is

647
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:23,850
something that's important skill is also

648
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:26,890
very apparent on the cam so normally

649
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,330
when we do our villages we are

650
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,890
completely disassembled locks they're

651
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,510
not mounted so the cam is usually taken

652
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,850
off because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually just fluff and</font>

653
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,770
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really help us but when it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

654
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,870
on a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't realize they're</font>

655
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,129
actually at the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock and so</font>

656
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,600
they'll be they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> going like this</font>

657
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,950
scratching scratching scratching and all

658
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,620
they're doing is eating up the back of

659
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,080
the block and again great way to tell if

660
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,299
they're actually skilled or not a great

661
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,039
way to find tool marks possibly trace

662
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:54,158
evidence from their tool just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

such amazing repeated use also<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

to get this material onto their own

tools to be found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a later date and tied</font>

recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave a talk on the future</font>

you're lucky you didn't see it I'm just

<font color="#E5E5E5">kidding what seems to be happening is</font>

671
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,360
that instead of these generic attacks

672
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,840
that we're finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're developing</font>

673
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,490
specific tools for specific locks and

674
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,678
some of those might not leave marks for

675
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">for various reasons a lot of those do</font>

676
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,880
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a tool called</font>

686
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:48,210
hooks into this channel here and rotates

687
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,860
this pink correctly and medico pins they

688
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,500

properly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then another locking</font>

690
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,400
mechanism falls into these grooves and

691
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,200
it can fully unlock the lock so you can

692
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,020
see the scratch marks in the channel

693
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,630
here are caused by his tool obviously

694
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,070
the keys not going to touch inside those

695
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,220
pieces because it just rotates the

does make marks to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very distinct very</font>

guns are essentially an old I don't say

707
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:38,490
pick gun is it's essentially bumping

708
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,500
with a tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a key essentially a pic</font>

709
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,510
gun is a needle that looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pic</font>

710
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,830
and it slaps against the bottom tumblers

711
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,420
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same way that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key hits</font>

against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom tumblers and they</font>

713
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,410
separate at the shear line you can open

00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,060

tool marks at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top and bottom because</font>

716
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,669
you still needed a secondary tension

<font color="#E5E5E5">striae in here where the pic gun was</font>

719
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:04,200
inserted as well as where it was where

720
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,300
it went off possibly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cam because</font>

721
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,920
again some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's I would say</font>

722
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a little bit harder to tell with</font>

723
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,110
the pic on how far you are in until you

724
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,790
actually hit it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that that angle</font>

725
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the pic gun shoots up at might</font>

726
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,570
still scratch this a little bit also

727
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find marks on the pins and what</font>

728
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,770
they look like are these little impact

729
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,360
marks and they're very distinct from

730
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,460
normal wear and they're very distinct

731
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,050
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock picking and you can see</font>

732
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,110
there's two right here and what's kind

733
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:33,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">of cool is that after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> repeated pick gun</font>

734
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,790
uses which is not uncommon to actually

735
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,320
open a lock they start to resemble this

736
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,820
bicycle spoke thing because as they're

737
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,439
hitting them they're kind of rotating

738
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,760
just like the key does as

739
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,590
being inserted except they're just

740
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,379
jumping up and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotating around</font>

741
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,790
and the cool part about this is that we

742
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,860
can actually identify how many times the

743
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,960
pic comes use because<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one is going</font>

744
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a pretty distinct mark based on</font>

745
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,710
where it actually hit which part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

746
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,700
key idea how hard it hit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and so</font>

747
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,840
forth so you can see right here you're a

748
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,470
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> separated but there's at least</font>

749
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,169
three or four right and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many times</font>

750
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,420
it used is generally not a huge huge

751
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,920
deal but it might you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if we see a</font>

752
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot we might say well maybe they took</font>

753
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,690
quite a lot longer than we would

754
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:19,770
expected to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect entry on the</font>

755
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:22,680
back the cam<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see you know even more</font>

756
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:24,600
distinct markings and we could you could

757
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,300
literally count you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one two three</font>

758
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,879
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost all these determine</font>

759
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,500
how many times<font color="#CCCCCC"> pickin was used and</font>

760
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,660
they're very distinct marks in the same

761
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,840
way that those amateur<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock picking</font>

762
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">things were where we can you know hope</font>

763
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,689
to find trace evidence on the pic gun if

764
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,820
we ever find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pic gun or find pick gun</font>

765
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:54,090
material in the lock because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

reference I couldn't fit in was Lee

768
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,480
Marvin and that made<font color="#CCCCCC"> me very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upset but</font>

769
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:03,600
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon I will find a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put Lee</font>

770
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,860

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,159
the guy on the microscope in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

772
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,060
beginning Sookie<font color="#E5E5E5"> popping is kind of this</font>

773
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,320
thing that again I'm very guilty of this

774
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,830
everybody was like oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god ki bumping</font>

775
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,879
how would we how would anybody know that

776
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">ki bumping was used and how would</font>

777
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,590
insurance companies know like they would

778
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">just say well it's your fault and maybe</font>

779
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:27,120
they could because many contracts were

780
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,429
written before ki bumping was popular so

781
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,469
they have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> closet says we cover you in</font>

782
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,230
a case of key bumping only in the case

783
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">of lock-picking or very specific tools</font>

784
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:40,230
and techniques so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very</font>

785
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,930
surprised a that that key bumping could

786
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,180
definitely be discovered but also that

787
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:47,130
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably one of the most damaging</font>

788
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,540
things you could do to a lock compared

789
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to all the other techniques you could</font>

790
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,100
pick besides destructive entry so keep

791
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,850
bumping we expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a lot of</font>

792
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,289
autumn

793
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">marks will expect to find marks on the</font>

794
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,549
face of the lock of the plug where the

795
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:01,320
key actually impacts remember we're

796
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:02,730
using mostly shoulder stopped keys so

797
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,799
that shoulder is going to impact pretty

798
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,630
hard into that plug we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find</font>

799
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,549
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottoms of the pins possibly</font>

800
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,169
the cam because some bump keys go

801
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:13,620
slightly deeper than a normal key<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

802
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:17,669
possibly hit the cam we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find</font>

803
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:19,559
in the the inside of the plug as well as

804
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:22,919
the chambers of the plug might be

805
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,750
slightly distorted so the act of bumping

806
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,590
basically we take a specially cut key

807
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:30,030
and we impact it into lock and that

808
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:33,539
works wonders for transferring kinetic

809
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:36,000
energy but that also impacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shit</font>

810
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:37,710
out of the pin and it's very clear right

811
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:44,100
there that something impacted the lock

812
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:45,840
right on a handmade bump key the cuts

813
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,030
might not be so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty they might be</font>

814
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,549
very jagged hand filed remold<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys</font>

815
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:53,908
usually very jagged very sharp they

816
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:57,570
might actually scratch as their denting

817
00:32:53,909 --> 00:33:01,380
and with that which I find very cool we

818
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:02,520
can compare that tool mark with a bump

819
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,620
key if we ever find it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because every</font>

820
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,020
every tool including bump keys have

821
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,809
unique characteristics that we might be

822
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to a tool mark we found</font>

823
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:13,770
and so in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see very</font>

824
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,270
distinct scratch and maybe that pattern

825
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,200
of scratching we can tie back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

826
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:21,150
monkey sometimes alternate lighting

827
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,919
helps in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the different</font>

828
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">techniques in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case I use all most</font>

829
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these are with LED light but this is</font>

830
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,039
just incandescent light maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

831
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,110
know i have a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different lights</font>

832
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,600
on the table and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i pick and choose and</font>

833
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:39,870
you find whatever works best and this we

834
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">could see quite a few dents quite a few</font>

835
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">scratches and so just like pick guns we</font>

836
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,429
can see how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times it was bumped</font>

837
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,379
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember we bump we take</font>

838
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the key out sometimes we put it back in</font>

839
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,059
that's rotating those pins so the

840
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,110
position we bump probably be different

841
00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:00,510
each time something that's kind of cool

842
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,120
and that we really haven't touched on<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

843
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:06,450
different designs of these pins so this

844
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of a top pin right and the</font>

845
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,418
bottom pins in this

846
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock are rounded on both ends so that</font>

847
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:12,598
they're easier when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're when you're</font>

848
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,678
pinning them you could just put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

849
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,470
either side<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have to worry</font>

850
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,030
about which sides up which sides down in

851
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:21,959
the case of this specific bumping attack

852
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:24,750
it that round thing impacting very

853
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,909
lightly with kinetic energy is causing

854
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:31,050
really big dents on the bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

855
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:35,429
top pin and on when we how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

856
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">have bumped and it didn't work right it</font>

857
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,960
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work just like pick guns</font>

858
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,240
takes couple tries usually when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

859
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,460
happens it's because your kinetic energy

860
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,279
isn't transferring well the pins<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

861
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,389
jump all together whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

862
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,919
usually ends up happening is that

863
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:51,119
instead of all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinetic energy</font>

864
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,179
flowing up and everything's beautiful

865
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,609
like in the animations actually that

866
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,050
front pin just gets slammed like all

867
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,670
that kinetic energy goes to it and it

868
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:05,040
doesn't know where to go so cuz uh and

869
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:07,770
it makes the like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah things also</font>

870
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,080
set at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock-picking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> village it</font>

871
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just impacts against that</font>

872
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">plugin and cylinder shear line and it'll</font>

873
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,549
cause these little dents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are not</font>

874
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,250
really consistent with anything else the

875
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:23,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's cool remember how I showed</font>

876
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:25,140
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how that bottom was impacted in this</font>

877
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:27,210
case the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been impacted</font>

878
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,980
and this duration which is a security

879
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">pin it's for anti lock picking use</font>

880
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,099
normally it's open like in here right

881
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:36,750
and that's to frustrate lock picking and

882
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:39,240
here it's been sealed shut because it's

883
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:41,790
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> bumped so hard right and so that</font>

884
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">bass it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a big difference but it is</font>

885
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,930
helping to defeat the anti picking

886
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,359
mechanisms of this lock and it's very

887
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,368
interesting and in this same photo you

888
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:54,900
could also see where the failed bumps

889
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:57,270
were where these big big<font color="#E5E5E5"> dents are the</font>

890
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,830
act of bumping again how these top pins

891
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,780
are hit they don't know where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

892
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,880
repeated bumping is going to stretch out

893
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,470
the pin chambers it's very slight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

894
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,080
probably won't affect the normal

895
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:09,689
operation lock but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could see around</font>

896
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this this pin chamber it's starting to</font>

897
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,980
stretch in almost all directions and

898
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,599
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to affect again binding as</font>

899
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,099
we talked about earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> some chip in</font>

900
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,559
chambers<font color="#E5E5E5"> we bigger than others now</font>

901
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:23,039
offset that's

902
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:26,609
is helped by bumping the face the lock

903
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,769
is one of the best examples but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

904
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:33,319
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly more information because</font>

905
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:36,779
that normal use not the same but similar

906
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:38,969
so one or two bumps might look the same

907
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:40,619
as normal use as far as the face of the

908
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:42,479
lock goes this is the lock that's been

909
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:44,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">at like every conference I've ever had</font>

910
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:47,399
locks at and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very depressing how</font>

911
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:49,379
bad this luck is now so you can see at

912
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the top of the key way big dance from</font>

913
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,979
where the key impacted it also at the

914
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:55,619
bottom most people don't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

915
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:57,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have the key has shoulders at the</font>

916
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,049
top on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom most of the time and</font>

917
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,989
so bottom has also been impacting this

918
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:06,329
again another example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock is not</font>

919
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:07,829
new but it's very clean and you can

920
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:09,719
clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same as</font>

921
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:11,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before it's very big dent</font>

922
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:15,569
rather than just a little white material

923
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:17,869
removal how many of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

924
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:20,579
minimal movement method of bumping is a

925
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:24,359
couple of you the two guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that went to</font>

926
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:26,069
my talk before minimal movement<font color="#E5E5E5"> mass is</font>

927
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,689
an alternate method of bumping or you

928
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:30,959
allow the key to go and slightly farther

929
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:32,549
and you you you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the key fully</font>

930
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:36,660
inserted it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little different same</font>

931
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:38,009
basic principle to bump the pins when

932
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,269
that happens if you all look at your

933
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:41,309
keys right now you'll notice right

934
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:43,109
around where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shoulder is the key</font>

935
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:45,989
material starts to get thicker for that

936
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle the bow of the key and when that</font>

937
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:50,489
happens and they use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a bump key</font>

938
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:52,618
that slightly distorts that front plug

939
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:54,119
material outwards because now it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

940
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:56,429
make room because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're forcibly</font>

941
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,400
impacting it into the lock and that's

942
00:37:56,429 --> 00:38:01,739
very noticeable and I would say it's

943
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,150
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rare that a normal key would would</font>

944
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:07,679
displace material like that impression

945
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,569
is another technique that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just talked</font>

946
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">about in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> village I hope you guys</font>

947
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:14,729
most of you saw that it's basically a

948
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:17,009
covert entry technique and covert when

949
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:18,390
when I say covert covert leaves forensic

950
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:20,549
evidence that's why we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

951
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now surreptitious techniques do</font>

952
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:24,630
not leave forensic evidence and we'll

953
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:27,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to that in a minute oh wow we're</font>

954
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,549
doing good<font color="#E5E5E5"> on time so impression is this</font>

955
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:31,499
technique where we use a blank key and

956
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:32,310
we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a lock we apply a lot of</font>

957
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:35,399
tension

958
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:37,380
and then we examine marks made by doing

959
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,970
this on the key file the key until we

960
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,400
get a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> cupid lock and it's very</font>

961
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:44,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective it's very awesome but it does</font>

962
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,770
leave forensic evidence and really the

963
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,600
only place we expect to find like really

964
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,550
damning forensic evidence because we're

965
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,670
basically using it like a normal key for

966
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,800
the most part is on these bottom pins

967
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:58,230
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that is think if we're</font>

968
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,240
all the pins rest down here normally and

969
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,410
we put a blank key in then they're all

970
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,629
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be raised all the way up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

971
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,460
that the bottom pin tip will be right

972
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:08,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">here so they'll all be blocking at the</font>

973
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,080
shear line and when we use that extreme

974
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,790
tension we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be cutting that</font>

975
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,759
in between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cylinder and the plug</font>

976
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:16,410
some somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this area and as we go</font>

977
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,270
through and we're filing down the key

978
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,740
those will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly lowered lowered</font>

979
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:22,050
until they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their normal resting</font>

980
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,720
spots so we expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find these these</font>

981
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,520
shear points along the bottom pins we do

982
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,470
not expect to find them on the top pins

983
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,900
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they ever allow the top pins</font>

984
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,430
to fall right here then the lock would

985
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,950
never open because the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be cut</font>

986
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,589
too low for those positions so

987
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:40,710
impression is very surprisingly easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

988
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:43,110
notice because almost none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tools</font>

989
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:46,410
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques actually touch the tops of</font>

990
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:48,120
those bottom pins like that so here you

991
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,920
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see there's quite a few shear</font>

992
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,839
sharing marks and they're pretty

993
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,390
distinct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bumping like</font>

994
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,250
pick guns we could tell how many times

995
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,509
the impression the lock and it's a

996
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">little different as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as impression</font>

997
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:02,190
and goes we can determine how many

998
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,740
rounds of impression ahead as well as if

999
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,900
they knew how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> to file between each</font>

1000
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,819
cut so you see here they're very closely

1001
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,120
spaced so that probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that the</font>

1002
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,890
attacker didn't didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the key key</font>

1003
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,270
coding standards so they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

1004
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,560
bit at a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to be on the safe</font>

1005
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,110
side to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure they didn't drop too</font>

1006
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,150
low in this example you see they're

1007
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:23,100
pretty far apart and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means the</font>

1008
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,840
person probably knew what lock it was

1009
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,029
and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it's all public</font>

1010
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,590
information so if you know the lock that

1011
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,870
you want an impression<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could just</font>

1012
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">cut down to factory depths instead of</font>

1013
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,350
filing a little by little saves a lot of

1014
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,940
time it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes the impression process</font>

1015
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:41,279
much easier but it also is somewhat

1016
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,750
noticeable to see on the lock you see

1017
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,120
these are very staggered we could also

1018
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,980
count it again

1019
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,500
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many rounds of impression they</font>

1020
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,640
went through maybe we can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it so</font>

1021
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,040
well that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can determine if they</font>

1022
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually went through enough rounds to</font>

1023
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,360
make work and key for the lock just like

1024
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,189
bumping the act of impressionen causing

1025
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,170
extreme torque is going to stretch those

1026
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:05,120
pin chambers but the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

1027
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,640
between this and bumping is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1028
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,589
completely lateral and bumping we can we

1029
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,060
might stretch in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any which way but in</font>

1030
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:13,900
this we're only going back and forth

1031
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,430
with the force of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key either way</font>

1032
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,350
something we talked about in lockpick

1033
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,930
village was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of ultraviolet</font>

1034
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,730
impressionen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its technique where we</font>

1035
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:25,430
coat the blank with ultraviolet eating

1036
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,660
and then impression with it and then

1037
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,940
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we take it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the marks will be</font>

1038
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:31,339
the positions that don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> UV em UV</font>

1039
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,810
ink it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective I find it it's</font>

1040
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,250
a little slower than traditional

1041
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,630
impressionen but it's much more

1042
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,030
consistent I don't have to worry about

1043
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,890
misinterpreting one of the marks because

1044
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:42,680
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear where there is ink and</font>

1045
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:45,049
there is not ink and doing this requires

1046
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,509
that we reapply UV ink every time we

1047
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:50,360
take a cut we file a cut on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font>

1048
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:52,850
lock it's dumping quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of UV</font>

1049
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:55,100
residue on the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see it's it's</font>

1050
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:57,110
in the keyway channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font>

1051
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,490
it's easy to see but on that pin right

1052
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,930
there we could also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

1053
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:02,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking it apart there's a little light</font>

1054
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:05,960
UV residue as well as on the shoulder

1055
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:07,400
right here if we see you thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1056
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,390
wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take it apart but I did</font>

1057
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,210
just for you guys we can also see on the

1058
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:17,240
pins really clear UV residue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

1059
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,060
really no good reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> UV would be</font>

1060
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,350
here for anything else that impression

1061
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,020
really no reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> lets you carry like</font>

1062
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:26,390
vials of UV ink in your pocket and one

1063
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,670
breaks and it gets on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> key but it's</font>

1064
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,830
it's unlikely that that will happen and

1065
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,710
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you can see very clear key</font>

1066
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:37,520
tracks of where it slid up and down the

1067
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:40,100
pins de coatings kind of this weird

1068
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,590
ambiguous technique we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock picking</font>

1069
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,140
which very clearly opens a lock that's

1070
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:46,970
all it wants to do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressionen</font>

1071
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,560
which makes a key to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open the lock it</font>

1072
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,720
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be a durable key but it does</font>

1073
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,790
open a lock and technically makes you a

1074
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,399
key decoding doesn't necessarily do

1075
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,930
either of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those what decoding does is</font>

1076
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,490
gives you the ability and the

1077
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">information well I should say the</font>

1078
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:04,069
information maybe not the ability to

1079
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:05,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a air to to know how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

1080
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:09,830
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> key for the lock so what that</font>

1081
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:12,530
means is we can identify the specific

1082
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:14,480
pattern of cuts that should be on the on

1083
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,070
the key but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

1084
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,050
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that making a key is</font>

1085
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:19,130
easy because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hard lock to</font>

1086
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,750
make a key for a lot of the

1087
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,850
high-security locks you might need

1088
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:26,720
specialized equipment to to cut those

1089
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:29,779
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> debs there's this idea of covert vs</font>

1090
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,730
vs surreptitious and decoding is really

1091
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,370
hard to fit into a category because it's

1092
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:36,800
so ambiguous a lot of decoding stuff is

1093
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,870
covert a lot other decoding stuff is

1094
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,210
surreptitious which means we really

1095
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,279
can't tell if it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually used or</font>

1096
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:45,110
not there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of a decoder pick</font>

1097
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,210
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick the lock and turn it now</font>

1098
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:49,700
the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> pins can only go as high as</font>

1099
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,740
they're supposed to go as far as opening

1100
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lock there's this idea of a pic that</font>

1101
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is basically a pic with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little lever</font>

1102
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,430
that tells you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> far up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pic is and</font>

1103
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,319
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use that to decode the the</font>

1104
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:03,430
depths of each pin after you pick the

1105
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,450
lock there's also this idea of

1106
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,589
manipulation of safes which we talked

1107
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:08,779
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the safecracking</font>

1108
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,400
thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is technically just using</font>

1109
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,380
the safe normally but you're taking

1110
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,900
diagnostic information as you're using

1111
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:18,080
it normally to determine a combination

1112
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:20,210
safes or combination locks correct

1113
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,670
sequence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of numbers letters whatever</font>

1114
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:24,710
that's surreptitious because how can we

1115
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:27,320
tell that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was used normally you know</font>

1116
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:29,150
maybe in some cases they took a long

1117
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,610
time to do it and the wear on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1118
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,050
internal components<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much greater but</font>

1119
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,480
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> general we say it's a surreptitious</font>

1120
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:38,810
technique there's also this idea of

1121
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,360
visual and optical decoding I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

1122
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:44,210
pull this up just because all this user

doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> pseudo I won't pull it up I</font>

have to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cameras off there's</font>

1126
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:56,240
this idea of visual and surreptitious

1127
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,620
decoding and visual means that we're

1128
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,410
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it or we're using</font>

surveillance observation to determine

1130

this and every how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:09,530
key on the table right now anybody you

1132
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,600
do so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I took a picture of that</font>

1133
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:14,390
key what if I have

1134
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:17,299
uh that that fire sprinkler is actually

1135
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,920
my spy satellite taking high res

1136
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,900
pictures could I determine the bidding

1137
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:25,610
of your of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> key could I look at the</font>

1138
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:30,680
codes does the key of a code no codes

1139
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:33,590
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so I'm one of those keys</font>

1140
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:36,200
has a code I guarantee it could I look

1141
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:40,670
at that code see the lady behind you

1142
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:42,080
just decoded your key right there could

1143
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:48,440
I look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that code and determine the</font>

1144
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:50,660
bidding yeah could I look at the decode

1145
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,700
yes I could there's also this there's

1146
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,529
this big published thing recently about

1147
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,419
how they developed a computer system

1148
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,880
that could extract the key bidding from

1149
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">a photograph</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a key which is pretty</font>

1150
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,710
obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple there's a really</font>

1151
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:07,010
awesome anecdote probably the only good

1152
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:09,200
one I have so bear with me here<font color="#CCCCCC"> diebold</font>

1153
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,210
made a voting machine and they were very

1154
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">proud of their voting machine that they</font>

1155
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,380
put a picture of the key with the voting

1156
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:18,770
machine like you know some guy like this

1157
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:20,720
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site and so somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

1158
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:23,180
well that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> this shitty wafer lock</font>

1159
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,649
I'll just make a key and the key worked

1160
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:31,790
on every voting machine in the United

1161
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:34,190
States yeah yeah a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is like</font>

1162
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:36,080
that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get lazy and just</font>

1163
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:37,850
like cryptography<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle and key</font>

1164
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,009
management is a bitch it's much easier

1165
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:42,049
just to mass produce the same key and

1166
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,490
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out to everybody but you don't</font>

1167
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:47,170
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your website for everybody to</font>

1168
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:49,669
look at there's also this idea of

1169
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:51,530
thermal decoding which is how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1170
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,940
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have used a keypad based combination</font>

1171
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:57,560
lock where you go you know 556 whatever

1172
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:59,990
pushing that leaves thermal heat residue

1173
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,450
on that and with correct viewing we

1174
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,609
could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that and figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out maybe</font>

1175
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,839
not the direct combination but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three</font>

1176
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:08,570
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are in it and that leaves</font>

1177
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:11,000
us very small number of possibilities

1178
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:13,850
for what the actual combination is and

1179
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,500
maybe maybe that's within the max tries

1180
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:17,750
limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could just automatically get in</font>

1181
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,190
that's another thing that surreptitious

1182
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,740
really hard to tell after the fact

1183
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:24,750
digital and optical it depends for the

1184
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:27,359
most part<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say they are</font>

1185
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,350
repetitious but it varies and one thing

1186
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">I should point out that I should have</font>

1187
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,620
pointed out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time ago is when we</font>

1188
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,660
speak of no forensic evidence we mean as

1189
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,460
it relates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> locks so you could very</font>

1190
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,990
well pick a lock and still have one of

1191
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,450
your hairs fall out your you know

1192
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:41,609
fingernails fingerprints all that kind

1193
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:43,259
of stuff can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen but as we</font>

1194
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of it it's only as it relates to</font>

1195
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">lock the rest is not the responsibility</font>

1196
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:49,890
of the forensic locksmith obviously

1197
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,570
there's also this idea of radiological

1198
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,279
attacks and we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this again</font>

1199
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the safecracking thing where we</font>

1200
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,510
basically you for lack of better terms

1201
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,490
we use an x-ray take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of the</font>

1202
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,740
inside of combination lock to find out

1203
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,500
where the visit what proper positions

1204
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:07,339
for each come up for each component told

1205
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:12,030
you to get used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the stuttering and</font>

1206
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:13,950
this is how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell maybe we can but</font>

1207
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,750
in a lot of cases the ability to detect

1208
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:17,609
something is more expensive than

1209
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever was stolen so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we won't bother</font>

1210
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:22,560
unless it's a very you know sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1211
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,790
high-profile thing we're generally not

1212
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,720
going to be able to detect stuff like

1213
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:29,880
that and also very few people are

1214
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going to have the skills and</font>

1215
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,470
equipment and money to actually do some

1216
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,120
of those attacks especially radiological

1217
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:38,970
I don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you like</font>

1218
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:42,589
bombard neutrons for fun but I'm

1219
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:46,709
guessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a very small number of you</font>

1220
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:49,230
there's also this idea of looking at the

1221
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,670
lock aside from the keys and decoding it

1222
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:53,430
visually how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1223
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:56,100
lock that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has colored pins do you know</font>

1224
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:59,580
what the colors are for I know you know

1225
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:02,850
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheating do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ma'am well what</font>

1226
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:05,250
are the colors for right exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> says</font>

1227
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:07,799
the depth of the each component so with

1228
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:10,560
that couldn't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a working key if</font>

1229
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,090
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a paola scope a borescope just</font>

1230
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,279
look in the lock real quick note down

1231
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:16,230
all the colors and then go home<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make</font>

1232
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,000
a key for it it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to do and</font>

1233
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:21,120
it's very hard to detect in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1234
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,400
cases so we consider this again

1235
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,200
surreptitious but in the when we're

1236
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,230
writing a forensic investigator

1237
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,509
locksmithing report will say we can't

1238
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:33,440
tell if this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually used but it's</font>

1239
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:36,090
a possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very possible that a</font>

1240
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,480
skilled you know well versed attacker

1241
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,090
would have done this

1242
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,220
because this is a problem may not be the

1243
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:44,890
problem that allowed method of entry<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

1244
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:48,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">be something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else we find would be that</font>

1245
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:50,710
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very is red flag another</font>

1246
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:52,330
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some locks specifically</font>

1247
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait for locks really crappy ones</font>

1248
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:56,859
actually sit at different heights when

1249
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,450
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a</font>

1250
00:49:56,859 --> 00:50:00,220
bad picture but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way for</font>

1251
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,750
like I have but you could actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1252
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,189
and I also cheated with a back light

1253
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,109
source but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll pretend there's a light</font>

1254
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,330
on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room wherever this is bear</font>

1255
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:09,279
with me here and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

1256
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,259
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit at different positions and</font>

1257
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,690
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the crappy microscope</font>

1258
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,900
not even a nice borescope or a nice

1259
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:18,970
ophthalmoscope and we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1260
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:22,770
where each sits and from that we could

1261
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:26,109
determine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct key bypass is</font>

1262
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:28,600
probably the fourth of our of our entry

1263
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:31,210
techniques and bypass a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1264
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,950
confuse in in my opinion confuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

1265
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">picking and impression and some other</font>

1266
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:38,319
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the bypass technique I consider</font>

1267
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:42,009
bypass to be any technique that doesn't

1268
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,320
touch the lock cylinder components so in

1269
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,760
bumping we<font color="#CCCCCC"> bumps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and components and pick</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not using a tool</font>

that's inserted into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keyway it could</font>

be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety of things how many of you</font>

1276
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:01,118
saw stupid lock shimming this year last

<font color="#E5E5E5">year where we open the shackle of the</font>

00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,500
padlock how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have seen silly</font>

1279
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:07,270
movies that that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this pretty</font>

1280
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,550
accurately but the credit card trick on

1281
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:12,070
doors it's a form of bypass because it

1282
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:18,730
out lock cylinders integrity is still

1283
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:21,880
maintained but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we we still getting</font>

1284
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:24,160
in so in these are also very ambiguous

1285
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,260
what a bypass means it's usually an

1286
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,710
attack against the cam the back of the

1287
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:31,660
lock the bolt the shackle something

1288
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:34,300
other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lock cylinder components</font>

1289
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:38,440
themselves most things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't those</font>

1290
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:40,510
fall under the auspices of a bypass so

1291
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,940
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best examples is a lock that</font>

1292
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:45,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't restrict</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that back cam tail</font>

1293
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">piece from rotating and actuating the</font>

1294
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,339
locking bolt oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought you had a</font>

1295
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,140
question

1296
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,390
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well go quick</font>

1297
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,180
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of this</font>

1298
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:59,460
American<font color="#E5E5E5"> 700 and basically what happens</font>

1299
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,080
is that the locks it's on the bottom

1300
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,900
half of that that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be</font>

1301
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,580
unopened 700 but we'll say it sits on

1302
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,370
one half and nothing restricts that

1303
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:10,049
piece from rotating at half circle so

1304
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,759
you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just there's a tool well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1305
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">insert and you just click that thing</font>

1306
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,290
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the shackle pops open of course</font>

1307
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,880
using that tool is going to leave leave

1308
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,560
marks where you're scratching it against

1309
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,150
whatever's in the back there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

1310
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">him pretty clearly in there on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">basically a little piece that fits over</font>

1317
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:42,060
that so you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so in this</font>

1318
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,950
picture we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the scratches where they</font>

1319
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,540
were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bypass it there's also a</font>

1320
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,520
tool that was developed to break this

1321
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,170
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they made a little wafer they</font>

1322
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,259
said haha now you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy press</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1323
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:54,480
locks so somebody made for all intensive

1324
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,160
purposes a small knife and you just

1325
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,750
hammered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that little piece away until</font>

1326
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,899
there was a hole and then you put your

1327
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:02,760
tool in and you open it again it's a

1328
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:06,000
cool story and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually ended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1329
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,220
completely redesigning the lock man it's

1330
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,690
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad we have a lot more to go so keys</font>

1331
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,160
we want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at materials key ways</font>

1332
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,640
cuts codes we don't know if it's an

1333
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:16,170
original duplicate hand cut machine

1334
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,850
recently cut recently copied the balls

1335
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:20,130
material transfer keys are a good source

1336
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:22,170
of material transfer because we handle

1337
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">them you know we we literally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> touch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1338
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:26,610
we put them in our pockets in our shirts

1339
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:29,010
they touch a lot of the things that can

1340
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:31,260
identify us plating is a good way to

1341
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,720
determine if the keys factory original

1342
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,730
or not factory regional plated keys will

1343
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,770
have the bidding plated as well most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1344
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:39,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a locksmith gets him his</font>

1345
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,730
blank keys are plated so when he cuts

1346
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:44,400
them the positions he cut are no longer

1347
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:46,170
plated we want to know if its original

1348
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,360
or copy that I'm gonna I would normally

1349
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to use your magic to</font>

1350
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,230
determine which is which but we don't

1351
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time so in this case this is the</font>

1352
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,040
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we know that because when</font>

1353
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,040
we look at the copy if you look on the

1354
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,600
left<font color="#CCCCCC"> that angle isn't quite flat the</font>

1355
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,970
angle the slopes are different the

1356
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,110
valleys aren't quite flat the spacing is

1357
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:07,350
a little different little Aang

1358
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:09,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">olaf when you copy a key usually what</font>

1359
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:11,069
happens at your local hardware store you

1360
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,570
look a locksmith is that you'll put two

1361
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,490
keys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's the blank ones your</font>

1362
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:17,340
riginal there's a little tracing wheel

1363
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:19,350
that rides your key and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's writing</font>

1364
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,790
the key a cutter is also cutting that

1365
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:23,130
blank key and that's how it worked and

1366
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:25,770
that could that rides on the side of the

1367
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:28,050
key where it didn't get where so you can

1368
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:29,400
see right here is that mark that it made

1369
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,480
it very<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear and it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1370
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,640
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go away for a while because</font>

1371
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,830
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is where the components are</font>

actually touching<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> week self</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keys</font>

1373
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:39,690
handmade usually because the the valley

1374
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:41,550
is very bad the spacing<font color="#CCCCCC"> between cuts the</font>

1375
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,530
depth of cuts is very bad very clear

1376
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:46,380
that that's not a professionally made

1377
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,550
key filing looks like that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1378
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,380
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip through these real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quick</font>

1379
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,450
these are all on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site at the end if</font>

1380
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,620
you want to go through and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at them</font>

1381
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,419
filing we could tell the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1382
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:57,990
file the grade of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file almost</font>

1383
00:54:54,420 --> 00:55:00,270
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it dremel same thing</font>

1384
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,770
they look different obviously but

1385
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're st. similar we can also</font>

1386
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,950
determine the speed of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cutting wheel</font>

1387
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,690
that cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1388
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:09,060
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you compare the two you see</font>

1389
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:10,740
that the staggering is much worse on

1390
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,509
this one these are much farther apart

1391
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,279
this is the lower speed key cutter being

1392
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,050
used as a higher speed key cutter being

1393
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,730
used if you remember our key from the

1394
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">brand new that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> factor original which</font>

1395
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:21,540
use very very high speed key cutters so

1396
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,310
they usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have this is real</font>

1397
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,660
jagged staggering that's more of a you

1398

<font color="#CCCCCC">know Bob's Bob's hardware kind of thing</font>

1399
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:31,620
we also determined for we're even here

1400
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,960
after this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keys been worn we could still</font>

1401
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:37,350
pretty much see that staggering between

1402
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,960
them bumping we could also tell if it's

1403
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:41,610
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used not only because it hits here</font>

00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that where those components are hitting</font>

00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:46,230
the key but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also impacting the</font>

1406
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:49,410
shoulder impressionen we're using a tool

1407
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:52,340
to grip the key usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> vice grips or</font>

1408
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:55,259
some proprietary locksmithing tool

00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:57,990
always and only tool marks so here we

1410
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,490
see that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not normal we look at it</font>

1411
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:02,490
closer we can see that's pretty clearly

1412
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:04,500
by Scripps some kind of pliers maybe we

1413
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,959
can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and we find that on</font>

1414
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:10,200
suspect we<font color="#CCCCCC"> compare a tool mark analysis</font>

1415
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:13,380
to a mark comparison we can you know do

1416
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:16,980
a very good job of identifying what

1417
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:17,999
tools and who was there residue used in

1418
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,679
a lot of copy base

1419
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:22,049
depression where we make a copy of a key

1420
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,509
by taking a mold of it I made a copy

1421
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:26,279
with my skin earlier that's still kind

1422
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:28,679
of there you probably won't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1423
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:30,119
forensics that but here's a little bit

1424
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:32,699
of clay residue on it and it's actually

1425
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty hard to clean a key when you when</font>

1426
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:37,259
you stick it in clay stick it in wax

1427
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,788
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> next it's actually pretty hard</font>

1428
00:56:37,259 --> 00:56:40,109
to get all of it off because you can

1429
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:41,849
only see so much and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

1430
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:47,159
magnifying glass probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to miss</font>

1431
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:51,149
something again more wax UV residue

1432
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:53,909
again we talked about UV anti forensics

1433
00:56:51,149 --> 00:56:56,519
tools are they possible maybe there's

1434
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:57,569
very limited research into this not a

1435
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:59,488
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people have published stuff</font>

1436
00:56:57,569 --> 00:57:01,949
they're difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use if they are</font>

1437
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:05,939
possible they're difficult to use I've

1438
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:08,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried brass fiberglass and carbon fiber</font>

1439
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:10,859
and none of them were anti forensics

1440
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:12,569
they all left some kind of mark and they

1441
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:15,538
were hard to use their pain in the ass

1442
00:57:12,569 --> 00:57:17,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">it may be expensive if they are possible</font>

1443
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:19,229
I assume they're expensive or somebody

1444
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:22,349
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have tried to make a normal</font>

1445
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:24,899
lockpick like that maybe maybe not I

1446
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:28,139
don't know save the vault forensics are

1447
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:32,459
kind of a talk on their own they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1448
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:33,419
cool thank you fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in safe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1449
00:57:32,459 --> 00:57:34,979
vault forensics we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

1450
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:37,288
the drill points we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1451
00:57:34,979 --> 00:57:39,928
any writings markings a lot of safe

1452
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:43,139
attacks or more often than not

1453
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:45,449
destructive just because in in this day

1454
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:47,339
and age it's a lot easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> as he is just</font>

1455
00:57:45,449 --> 00:57:49,679
to drill your way in it may be louder

1456
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:51,749
but it's much easier than sitting there

1457
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,729
manipulating it or any really anything

1458
00:57:51,749 --> 00:57:56,009
else especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the case of</font>

1459
00:57:53,729 --> 00:57:58,919
manipulation resistant<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocks or safe</font>

1460
00:57:56,009 --> 00:58:00,719
excuse me we might also<font color="#CCCCCC"> find magnetic or</font>

1461
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:02,788
adhesive residue where a drill rig was

1462
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,049
attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the front of the lock of</font>

1463
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:06,449
course we're going to find tool marks

1464
00:58:04,049 --> 00:58:08,549
again not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> safes are combination</font>

1465
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:10,709
saves a lot of safes use the exact same

1466
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:12,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of locks that we talked about lever</font>

1467
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:14,848
locks wait for locks pin tumbler locks

1468
00:58:12,709 --> 00:58:16,709
one thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that drill points some</font>

1469
00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:18,089
people just put holes in and they're

1470
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:21,689
safe and assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can get away</font>

1471
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:23,459
with with insurance fraud just because

1472
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:26,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">well there's clearly somebody drilled</font>

1473
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:28,408
into it but the exact position where the

1474
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,909
drill was used is very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1475
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:31,950
there's various ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a drill to</font>

1476
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:34,200
open it safe

1477
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:36,839
is it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an experienced safe technician</font>

1478
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,549
is very easy to tell if those those

00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:41,430
points could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been used to actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's only three books and one and a</font>

it's easier LP forensics calm they both

1504
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,828
go the same site<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't I always hate</font>

it when people put like a thousand lakes
