1
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,420
and some of you know him his video man

2
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,969
some of you know him is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous</font>

3
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,579
speaker here at layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> one he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

4
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,809
be talking about ganool radio which is I

5
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,370
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are gonna get a kick out</font>

6
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,140
of it I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what your new radio</font>

7
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,548
was till about I don't know six seven

8
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,580
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking into it</font>

9
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,759
and it's pretty pretty cool everything

10
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,990
from the ability to crack gsm and things

11
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,310
like that all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there just</font>

12
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,798
building your own transmitters it's

13
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,009
pretty neat so further out further ado

14
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:27,380
here's David great thank you welcome

15
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:31,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so let's set up the slides here</font>

16
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so how to have fun with</font>

17
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:38,240
wireless transmissions is essentially

18
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,800
what can you radio and in my opinion is

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,119
David Bryan I'm an information security

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:49,229
consultant I've been doing security for

21
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">nine plus years cissp ham ham radio</font>

22
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,060
license which don't tell the FCC that

23
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,539
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this stuff but because they</font>

24
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,600
might revoke my license anyway hacker I

25
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,750
also do the network at Def Con and I

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,970
work with annoyed and the crew so or at

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:11,940
least at Def Con all right I apologize

28
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">this this clicker is moving the slides</font>

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,530
to every once in a while I don't know

30
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:18,480
why but so one of the things I wanted to

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,829
say about layer one was that I think

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,390
it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing that we're</font>

33
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,549
doing this it's keeping the community

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,070
strong I think it's something that we

35
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,810
need to continue to engage in and you

36
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,730
know start to build these relationships

37
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,489
with other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are smart and</font>

38
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,929
figuring stuff out because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font>

39
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,680
will lead to a stronger community

40
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,359
overall in a stronger security stance

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,630
within our information security and

42
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:46,500
within security in general so I think

43
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great and i also want to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,130
thank people who are doing hackerspaces

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are really great tools for</font>

46
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,600
people to come out and start working

47
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">with hardware that they've never seen or</font>

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,500
start playing on things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

49
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,390
never made never played with in this

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,879
particular instance we've got Mitch

51
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,980
Altman has anybody heard of the TV be

52
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,849
gone so he's the creator

53
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,730
of the TV be gone he came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ccc Casey</font>

54
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:15,000
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> cow town computer Congress of</font>

55
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,518
Kansas City my wife and I drove down

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">there from Minneapolis to hang out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

57
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,250
jurist and Mitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> Altman for the weekend</font>

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,379
and he did a workshop with about 20

59
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,940
people who had never soldered before and

60
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,069
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just great I mean it was really</font>

61
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,109
fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the all these people working</font>

62
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,679
on stuff like oh this is this is how I

63
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,150
do it so kudos to them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if</font>

64
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,680
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and running</font>

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,900
I think it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a really good thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so before i start the the main</font>

67
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">component of the talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just had this i</font>

68
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,150
did a talk last week on lockpick bump

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,000
keys and hackers up in minneapolis for

70
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,040
our local security group up there and

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,180
one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i included in</font>

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,940
that the talk was essentially well

73
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,530
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and so I just thought</font>

74
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,120
it was kind of neat from the perspective

75
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:11,340
that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody know what this is yep</font>

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,410
a request<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exit sensor RTE is what</font>

77
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,180
they'll technically call it but so

78
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,918
essentially I've always heard or been

79
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,840
under the impression that oh you just

80
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,219
take a mylar balloon you slip it under

81
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,400
their fill it with helium and the door

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,970
trips and it opens I was like that can't

83
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,280
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually went and tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,910
I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to close out I was out at a</font>

85
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,388
distribution center for one of our

86
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,870
retail clients and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the local</font>

87
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:46,460
store picked up some tin foil a rubber

88
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:51,870
hose and balloons all sorts of fun stuff

89
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:54,659
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also picked up a hot pack and so</font>

90
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically I figured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's see</font>

91
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,770
oh it's jumping around on me<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

92
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,539
so I figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that throw the hot back</font>

93
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,830
and microwave for three minutes get a

94
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:10,110
really long ruler and a envelope stuff

95
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:13,950
it under the door and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some point the</font>

96
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,800
tour opens up so and it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

97
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,650
the sensor is looking for infrared so it

98
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,500
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty fun alright so now</font>

99
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:31,289
on to my real topic which is gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> radio</font>

100
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:33,979
come on there we know all right maybe

101
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">should stop using this anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

102
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,650
countermeasures for that particular

103
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,020
attack I'm getting ahead of myself is

104
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,159
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gap there's usually a gap under</font>

105
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,680
those doors that don't need to be there

106
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:45,900
because installers are lazy so you know

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,960
either put some sort of a component to

108
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,849
fill in that gap under the door or

109
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,729
disable the use of the request to exit

110
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:58,110
sensor to either unlock that that

111
00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:01,530
mechanism or trip the magnetic strike or

112
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">D engage the magnetic strike so in a lot</font>

113
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,859
of companies I've seen them put in and

114
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:07,919
push<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push the butt exit sensors or</font>

115
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,539
push to exit essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> and those work</font>

116
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,340
great sort of crash bars which

117
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,060
essentially is a physical mechanism

118
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,940
again so all right hacking with the new

119
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,940
radio how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here know what</font>

120
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,979
canoe radio is oh good we got quite a

121
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,450
few people here there's a few that may

122
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:29,310
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a had exposure to it so good</font>

123
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,289
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about what it is</font>

124
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,080
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need some of the requirements</font>

125
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:37,500
for going to radio and then some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

126
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:43,190
costs and then we'll also go into after

127
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:46,380
that a sort of a attack that I did so

128
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,419
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is gonna radio its software it's a</font>

129
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,229
software component with a hardware piece

130
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:55,590
linked together it's made out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> C code</font>

131
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:57,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python the python is where you know</font>

132
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,090
the users<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get into making the</font>

133
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,490
changes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code and then it's</font>

134
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,349
compiled into byte code which runs very

135
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,919
very quickly and very fast on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

136
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:10,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">different machines so and it's it's very</font>

137
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Universal from that perspective I don't</font>

138
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,400
know if anybody's worked with Python

139
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,430
here yes a few few head nods here yeah

140
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,510
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so python is fast it's you know it</font>

141
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,820
runs in memory it's not i mean it is an

142
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,000
interpreted language but it's changed

143
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,300
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytecode before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's I</font>

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,590
they run which is good<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now</font>

145
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,180
on to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. RP is the</font>

146
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,330
hardware component that's this thing

147
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,000
sitting right here that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

148
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,250
software there's a couple things that

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">are good to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you probably don't need</font>

150
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,300
to know once you start getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into it</font>

151
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:50,110
unless you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some advanced stuff</font>

152
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:53,380
but it's got an<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpga on it it's got a</font>

153
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,990
for digital analog converters and for

154
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,450
analog-to-digital converters there's

155
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,280
essentially what i would call for

156
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,130
channels on the board there's a transmit

157
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,969
side a and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tran and receive side a and</font>

158
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,500
a transmit side being a receive site B

159
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,620
and then there's daughter boards from

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:15,550
point 1 megahertz all the way up to 5

161
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,870
gigahertz there's sort of the picture of

162
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,640
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see a little bit better</font>

163
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:25,780
hopefully and then here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual the</font>

164
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:28,780
motherboard or the board component you

165
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,539
can see it's got receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit a</font>

166
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,010
transmit and receive and these are where

167
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:37,180
you'd put the daughter boards in the a

168
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:39,490
side or the B side and these are the

169
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:43,319
daughter boards so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a basic</font>

170
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:47,920
receive we've got I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this one's a</font>

171
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">transmit oh no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so anyway 800 800</font>

172
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,520
megahertz 2.4 gigahertz received and

173
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,750
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a receive and transmit</font>

174
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:59,199
I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that's the flex 900</font>

175
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:04,930
so that will do 900 megahertz if I can't

176
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:07,390
see from here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyway so how can I</font>

177
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:12,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">use it obviously we've we've got to get</font>

178
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:14,350
the hardware the<font color="#CCCCCC"> usrp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now I say install</font>

179
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">on boot to just from the perspective if</font>

180
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you actually want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it running with</font>

181
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:23,020
little pain the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

182
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,760
install it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually started installing</font>

183
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,710
it on my macbook I got everything

184
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">installed I got all the dependencies and</font>

185
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,460
you know two or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> days later I</font>

186
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,459
started going<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright let's attach to</font>

187
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,370
this sucker and then I surely realized

188
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:37,439
that my hard work didn't work

189
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,870
because it was the first generation of

190
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,380
macbook pro didn't have a USB 2.0 full

191
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,970
speed bus the u.s. RP requires that full

192
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,720
speed bus in order to be able to

193
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:51,029
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and forth so or other</font>

194
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,040
unix-like OS if if you do another

195
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,100
unix-like OS you're probably going to

196
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,150
dependency hell and it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

197
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,490
consuming to get all the dependencies

198
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,290
compiled together<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

199
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,140
playing with it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point you</font>

200
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,370
might give up and move on although if

201
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:10,170
you spent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money on the hardware you</font>

202
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:13,260
probably won't but anyway so the the

203
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,150
first one obviously requires USB 2.0<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

204
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,550
second version which it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> came out I</font>

205
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,550
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just posted to the website this</font>

206
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,620
week is<font color="#E5E5E5"> version 2 and it actually has a</font>

207
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gigabit Ethernet on it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have</font>

208
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,900
faster bus throughput essentially you

209
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,790
know runs a protocol on top of that

210
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:35,610
ethernet to talk back and forth directly

211
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:38,880
to the controller<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so why should</font>

212
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:42,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">I use it wireless signal generation and</font>

213
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:47,700
receiving it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily</font>

214
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:49,140
restricted to any one frequency when you

215
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,839
go through and actually put together a

216
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,850
circuit an oscillation circuit it can be

217
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,260
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a pain in the butt from the</font>

218
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,120
perspective that you know you got to

219
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">design the circuit you got to transfer</font>

220
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,860
it to a physical board you got to put it

221
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">together you're prototyping can take a</font>

222
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,800
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in order to get you know a</font>

223
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,360
wireless protocol put together and your

224
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,420
your oscillator also has to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

225
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,000
circuit and a bunch of other stuff

226
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:17,339
however with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. RP it's very quick</font>

227
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,800
to to prototype you know you write a

228
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,930
block of code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is your frequency</font>

229
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,150
modulation or demodulation or however

230
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,520
you're encoding your signals and boom

231
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:30,890
you got it wedged into data stream

232
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,890
between you and another another usrp

233
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so cost the version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one was</font>

234
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,469
seven hundred dollars it still is or it

235
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,380
is seven hundred dollars now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

236
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a little bit more but version 2 is</font>

237
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,720
fourteen hundred dollars so i don't know

238
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,270
why these are so expensive in my opinion

239
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,420
they should be

240
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:53,860
super<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see them get down</font>

241
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,469
into the five hundred dollar range so

242
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,600
that just about<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody can get them</font>

243
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,580
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> that said you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

244
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,620
doing the research I found that a lot of

245
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,950
people were saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if they</font>

246
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,170
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a gsm oscilloscope or some</font>

247
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,640
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gsm test equipment they were in</font>

248
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,209
the twenty to thirty thousand dollar

249
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,980
range so yeah if you can you can get the

250
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. RP if you can scrape the money</font>

251
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,950
together it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot cheaper</font>

252
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:24,490
it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be as powerful but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

253
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,790
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still pretty good so daughter</font>

254
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,040
boards screws case yeah that the biggest

255
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,949
thing here this last one is it's not

256
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,380
specifically FCC part licensed so that

257
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:38,200
means does it does anybody know what

258
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:41,410
part licensed means here I got a couple

259
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:44,050
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no yeah well so there's part</font>

260
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:48,040
15 but specifically in radio

261
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:51,130
transceivers anything that transmits the

262
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,319
story is that so my wife and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go to</font>

263
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,210
DEFCON and we have a su radios that

264
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,620
we've modified to transmit on other

265
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:01,720
frequencies although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will not admit</font>

266
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:04,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this room but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

267
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is not a not it's it's a</font>

268
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,689
non-compliant device now it's not part

269
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,580
of that FCC part license she actually

270
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,260
wanted to use our radios in<font color="#E5E5E5"> search and</font>

271
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">rescue she does search and rescue it's</font>

272
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,310
expensive radio this rich and rescue

273
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:21,910
radios<font color="#CCCCCC"> are expensive unfortunately he</font>

274
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,349
can't she couldn't specifically use it

275
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,569
because then it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of the</font>

276
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,160
part license and if the unit ever got

277
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,460
called into question Yatta Yatta Yatta

278
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,350
all right fine so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where that</font>

279
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,720
part licensing gets into play here if

280
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,980
it's not part licensed that means you

281
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,410
can't transmit on those other

282
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,000
frequencies or if it is part license

283
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,680
that means it can't do any other

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">frequencies besides what it's licensed</font>

285
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,280
to do it's kind of goofy they own the

286
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,400
airwaves they can do whatever they want

287
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,560
so it's really nice that you can

288
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,720
essentially have a low power transmitter

289
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,849
that is not part part license because

290
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,510
you can oftentimes put bigger

291
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,670
transmitters beyond that so you can do

292
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,819
fun things like owning your

293
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,160
neighborhoods data right priceless

294
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:14,070
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so what what can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

295
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:17,890
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can fight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what change anyway</font>

296
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:20,080
wireless attacks so in the past there's

297
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,840
been a couple of rfid attacks there's

298
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,320
been a gsm attacks recently there's a

299
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">bluetooth frequency hopping attack and</font>

300
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:35,250
then mas which is what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> i kind of i'm</font>

301
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:39,069
going to talk about so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID attacks</font>

302
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:41,410
reading the tags there was recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

303
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,170
year the boston subway hacks which are

304
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,380
actually just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fare based rfid card</font>

305
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,300
system so that came from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the london</font>

306
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,050
system essentially you know the london

307
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:55,120
hackers did that the Mifare system

308
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,949
previously and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

309
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that you could do long-range tag</font>

310
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,470
reading you know essentially you load up

311
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,360
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of energy on your your transmitted</font>

312
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,600
and ideally you're going to have a lot

313
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:12,640
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy coming back from that tag</font>

314
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:14,650
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> physics it so that I mean that</font>

315
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,150
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that people have</font>

316
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,590
always said<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well you can't read my</font>

317
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:21,130
tag because you have to be next to me

318
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:23,920
well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true you know you can be</font>

319
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:28,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">just about anywhere well within</font>

320
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:33,010
line-of-sight so gsm attacks wiki th sea

321
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:39,339
org<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a whole set of codes on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

322
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:43,420
gsm cracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> OH airport org all right</font>

323
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:47,530
there we go so the other thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font>

324
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:52,060
is there is gsm code in the in the canoe

325
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:53,560
radio source code create your own base

326
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,750
station you know essentially you could

327
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,300
have call routing I mean you know that's

328
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,950
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool thing or just have a call</font>

329
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,490
free zone where you Doss all your

330
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:06,480
friends you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with that</font>

331
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:09,980
just stop answering your phone anyway

332
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,149
bluetooth attacks so

333
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,870
everybody know what frequency-hopping

334
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:17,610
spread spectrum is there's a few all

335
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,250
right now get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so frequency</font>

336
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:23,460
hopping is essentially where it will hop

337
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:27,060
between a set number of channels to some

338
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:30,750
degree it's pseudo-random and it's based

339
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,430
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the devices themselves and it's been</font>

340
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">very hard to follow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't</font>

341
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">know where it's going to be until you've</font>

342
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,319
already seen it and then it's moved from

343
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:41,700
once you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's moved on</font>

344
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,730
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out</font>

345
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,830
what some people figured out is actually

346
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">this was presented at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shamu con and</font>

347
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:52,920
there was a DC 4420 meeting that

348
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,839
presented the blue sniffing attacks they

349
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,430
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out Oh we'll put a bunch of us</font>

350
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,709
are peas together and basically just

351
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:02,579
dump the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> spectrum and we'll follow</font>

352
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:04,770
one on one where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmit has</font>

353
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,600
happened essentially and come back and

354
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,790
decode the audio stream and inject into

355
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,899
it and do all sorts of nasty stuff with

356
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:14,579
the Bluetooth communications so I think

357
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's pretty cool and I would love to</font>

358
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">see more of this expanded on I don't</font>

359
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:24,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily but it'd be</font>

360
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:27,000
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so mas has anyone heard of</font>

361
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,640
this multiple access system all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

362
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">got one here do you work for a utility</font>

363
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:40,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">ah oil and gas company I won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell so</font>

364
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:45,389
it in this particular instance it I I

365
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:49,100
was hired by a company or a utility to

366
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:52,410
assess the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security of this mas system I</font>

367
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,750
had a set number of hours to work on the

368
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,750
project so I didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

369
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,640
decoding of the data but you'll see what

370
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,490
I kind of figured out I figured out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

371
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,550
i did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> search on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> frequencies that</font>

372
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:08,520
they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the major frequencies and</font>

373
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:11,940
found this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E article from 1992</font>

374
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:16,080
about all this is you know supervisory

375
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:18,260
controls<font color="#CCCCCC"> yada yada yada essentially it's</font>

376
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,230
a really simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeater type system</font>

377
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,960
where you'll have a head end

378
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:26,660
that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> your utility management</font>

379
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,470
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will talk to repeater and</font>

380
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:36,020
then that will repeat out to the other

381
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:38,210
sites and so like in this particular

382
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,700
case let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I wanted to check the</font>

383
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:44,929
status<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know the the watermark on</font>

384
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,850
a pump so i would i would take send my

385
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:48,620
input frequency into the the repeater

386
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,080
repeater would then<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit it out to</font>

387
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,520
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other stations all the stations</font>

388
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,879
would hear it and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them would go</font>

389
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,850
oh that's my ID I better respond it

390
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,320
would stop transmitting the remote

391
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,360
station that that's supposed to call

392
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">back in and say alright you know my</font>

393
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,280
water levels at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 500 feet or whatever it</font>

394
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:10,040
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> would then start transmitting on the</font>

395
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,200
repeater hit through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter transmitted</font>

396
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,620
back out to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stations and anybody</font>

397
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,980
who's listening within that area on its

398
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:23,899
water level status or admin status or

399
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:26,870
pump status or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is alright so</font>

400
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,730
I thought you know that's kind of

401
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,909
interesting what could I do with this as

402
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:36,049
an unauthenticated user could<font color="#CCCCCC"> I maybe</font>

403
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:38,150
take over the repeater I mean oh but I'd

404
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:43,490
have to have a part licensed system for

405
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:47,660
that right thus comes the new radio the

406
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:49,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">usrp so I thought all right I'll try</font>

407
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll try bringing it up I mean it's very</font>

408
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,960
simple this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really simple attack</font>

409
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,730
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just bringing up a carrier frequency</font>

410
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,540
with some audio on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto that</font>

411
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,309
repeaters input frequency so in typical

412
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,649
repeaters you have an input frequency

413
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,850
that's what you're transmitting to the

414
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,280
repeater and then there's a different

415
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,590
frequency in this case it was you know

416
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,860
928 megahertz something's on some and

417
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:15,470
952 something something something and so

418
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:19,969
the output frequency would then you know

419
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:23,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">transmit all the commands all right I'll</font>

420
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,950
do that so I I grabbed the little

421
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,010
antenna that comes with the kit you know

422
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:31,590
drove up near<font color="#CCCCCC"> the water tower</font>

423
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:34,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">transmitted hmm this doesn't work</font>

424
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,020
kind of weird call in to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the radio</font>

425
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:40,400
operators and nothing or that the tower

426
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:43,289
operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that's all nothing</font>

427
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,850
so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I did was all right</font>

428
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:46,620
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger antenna this is my</font>

429
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,139
ham radio antenna yes it should work

430
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,229
it's maybe not tuned to the 900

431
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,049
megahertz frequency but you know it's a

432
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,669
big antenna and I think it's a maybe a

433
00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:01,559
five decibel gaining or something along

434
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:04,380
those lines it's it should be good and

435
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:08,789
last no I still didn't get a get it to

436
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,789
trip so I'm like this is this is bull I

437
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:14,730
and so I've only got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hundred</font>

438
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">milliwatts output power on my menu srp</font>

439
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:20,720
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would have to get a linear amp or</font>

440
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:30,630
something or maybe an antenna that's

441
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:34,679
much much bigger so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did that I went</font>

442
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:38,730
and stood outside the tower and lo and

443
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:41,549
behold<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh calm fale com fale com fail</font>

444
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,470
come fale com fail so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

445
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:45,960
brought down the SCADA Network by just

446
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,390
bringing up on a carrier frequency I'm

447
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,669
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that this hack is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> elegant but</font>

448
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:55,320
I am saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is wrong</font>

449
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:57,390
these networks need to be a much higher

450
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:02,340
availability higher integrity in my

451
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:04,950
opinion so essentially i overpowered the

452
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,039
transmitter I think I probably was

453
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:10,640
transmitting about one watt overall

454
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:15,029
which is actually really low considering

455
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,690
what I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually hitting so but it</font>

456
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:20,789
worked got the comm fail and moved on

457
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,970
and said hey you know it probably should

458
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:25,980
do some some different network there we

459
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,870
go different network attack or different

460
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,470
networking for this you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide</font>

461
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">open system no authentication no</font>

462
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:38,210
encryption no integrity again it's that

463
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:41,490
single in multiple out type repeater

464
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,110
when you're using those you know

465
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously there's congestion or</font>

466
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:48,540
so for congestion in this this instance

467
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,250
I think it I don't I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just think it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

468
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,840
poor design it wasn't designed very well

469
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,660
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed you know back in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

470
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,340
early 90s<font color="#E5E5E5"> when hey the skate of stuff we</font>

471
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,340
gotta we gotta use our radios to

472
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,260
transmit this data back and forth

473
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:05,070
typically or prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this they would</font>

474
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:09,049
used dry pair lines or modem lines or

475
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:11,460
some sort of you know really expensive a

476
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:14,639
56k frame relay or something along that

477
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,860
lines and they went hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for ten</font>

478
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,929
thousand dollars or not maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

479
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,399
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred thousand or whatever you</font>

480
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:23,010
can put this up you'll never have to

481
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,500
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything in the next you know 50</font>

482
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,929
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll just pay FCC licensing</font>

483
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,000
fees you know every<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for those</font>

484
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:36,059
frequencies that you're using and nobody

485
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,460
else can transmit on those<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

486
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,530
some of the rate of fixes in my opinion

487
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,750
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know using encryption and</font>

488
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,250
having some sort of authentication or

489
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,919
authorization to transmit on those

490
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:50,100
frequencies that are built into the

491
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,679
software not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the actual</font>

492
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,480
frequency to have the security in the

493
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,070
environment the other thing that'd be

494
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,870
kind of cool would be use some of the

495
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,570
mesh networking technologies with 802 11

496
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean if you could have your utilities</font>

497
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,040
having multiple sites that are linked

498
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,659
together if one of those links goes down

499
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,490
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be self healing or at least</font>

500
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,809
that would that would be the concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

501
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:14,850
it would route around the outage another

502
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,918
one is out-of-band management you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

503
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's enough internet</font>

504
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,299
connectivity in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cities that you</font>

505
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,309
could drop in and out a band management

506
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:26,639
that wouldn't be this radio transmitter

507
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:29,639
of course there's also enough utilities

508
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,530
that are way the hell out in BFE where

509
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,750
you can't get to and that's where the

510
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,928
radio comes in well you know you use a

511
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:41,730
better technology to manage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font>

512
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:43,130
radio station<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right all right so</font>

513
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:49,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quick demo here</font>

514
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:56,820
hopefully this works I've tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

515
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:58,320
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you never know so</font>

516
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:03,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one we're going to do is an</font>

517
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:06,600
oscilloscope anyone seen or heard of an

518
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,770
oscilloscope before I'm sure most people

519
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,659
here hopefully if you've got an

520
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:12,350
electronics background you've you've

521
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,350
seen or heard of it

522
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:27,330
takes a moment better it's on another

523
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:30,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">window there we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so there's</font>

524
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:34,530
an oscilloscope it's going nuts there's

525
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:38,610
something transmitting here you wonder

526
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:41,090
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm what could this be and it's</font>

527
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:47,879
it's taken up so much CPU now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

528
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:52,770
crapped out it happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes yeah d</font>

529
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:55,890
das on my own box alright so now let's

530
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:59,300
see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one here this one here this</font>

531
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,300
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a really cool view</font>

532
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:12,418
pretty very pretty so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

533
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:14,370
essentially that's something that's

534
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:19,820
transmitting here and you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

535
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:23,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">see it what I would call it a histogram</font>

536
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,499
essentially where this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is essentially</font>

537
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,240
the spectrum back and forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font>

538
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:31,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is transmitting on the</font>

539
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:34,049
spectrum boy that's a lot of traffic

540
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:39,679
maybe we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> once we identify it will</font>

541
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:39,679
come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so exit out of this</font>

542
00:26:48,909 --> 00:27:07,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so it's out of sync but yeah</font>

543
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:12,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's try going to know if you can see</font>

544
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:16,449
this or not but can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of see that</font>

545
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:18,729
there's a picture there kinda I didn't

546
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,099
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to write the decoding software</font>

547
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:24,159
for this unfortunately but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

548
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:25,749
essentially we've got a camera here you

549
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:31,179
can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see that there's a picture</font>

550
00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:35,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">now and you kind of its it's not perfect</font>

551
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:36,789
that's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure but you obviously you</font>

552
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:38,139
can identify the fact that hey something

553
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:41,609
out there is transmitting so now let's

554
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:46,019
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let's go back to our spectrum</font>

555
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:51,820
this guy the waterfall spectrum right

556
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:53,379
going going going gone so it does a

557
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,549
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job of showing hey there's</font>

558
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">something on these frequencies right</font>

559
00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:01,929
here this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is supposed to be set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up for</font>

560
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:06,970
nine hundred and six megahertz here I

561
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:12,669
can show you like it back in lots of

562
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:14,259
lots of noise yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately there's</font>

563
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:17,320
no water utility around here that would

564
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:20,649
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to demonstrate today so anyway</font>

565
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:25,470
um and I don't want to get in trouble

566
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:28,649
with the feds contracts are good alright

567
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:31,869
any questions on that one anything

568
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:34,590
you're wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that I got one</font>

569
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:34,590
back here

570
00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:02,900
yep it's a 10 megahertz bandwidth so

571
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:05,090
yeah it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 megahertz below and five</font>

572
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,610
megahertz above when it transmits its

573
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,490
video so it's a color video camera and

574
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,479
it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have audio with it as well</font>

575
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,630
although I couldn't find the audio

576
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,440
channel which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of frustrating i</font>

577
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:19,970
bought it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i came into town yes sir</font>

578
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">thursday and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went to frys and friday</font>

579
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,360
morning and bought it so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like hey</font>

580
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,380
you know this might be kind of fun to

581
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,149
show at least some sort of idea what you

582
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:33,440
can do with the spectrum analysis and

583
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:42,670
those types of tools so there's another

584
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:46,550
question over here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

585
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:49,190
have I used RF shielding with multiple

586
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:52,850
daughter cards or is it required even

587
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:56,420
well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

588
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:58,969
required because it literally comes out

589
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,550
of it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the socket you know that</font>

590
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:05,300
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmitted wire comes out and then</font>

591
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets ported into the front here yeah I</font>

592
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't I only have one transmitter in</font>

593
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,149
this box so I can't say specifically as

594
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:15,920
anybody else worked with the US are

595
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:21,140
ESPYs here no all right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

596
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:22,790
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

597
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,110
how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I contribute this is one of the</font>

598
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,540
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see people</font>

599
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,399
contribute with this project<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I'm</font>

600
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,170
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of frustrated with the perspective</font>

601
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,630
that you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like hey i</font>

602
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:36,110
created this python script for this TV

603
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and three years later it still</font>

604
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,560
says in the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should come back and</font>

605
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,350
create the video de codes for this like

606
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,659
what why haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys done this so I</font>

607
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,240
want people to play with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that</font>

608
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it was noisebridge that's got</font>

609
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,690
stuff up on their wiki about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RP</font>

610
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,910
noisebridge is up in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco I'm i</font>

611
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,880
would assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they would probably be</font>

612
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,280
willing to let<font color="#CCCCCC"> people play with their us</font>

613
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,500
p maybe put up a box somewhere and have

614
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,629
the radio available for people to hack

615
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,800
at it you know test their code because

616
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,760
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an expensive box and I might even</font>

617
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a really good</font>

618
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,390
thing for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do I've got this thing</font>

619
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:17,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">why not stick it up so people can play</font>

620
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:20,080
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so I post about what you've done</font>

621
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:22,090
and what you plan to do and see you know

622
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,580
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that everybody sees your code</font>

623
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,870
that's the biggest thing is people write

624
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,879
the code and then they forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

625
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,500
move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next thing it'd be nice</font>

626
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,310
to have more people posting stuff about

627
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:37,450
this play with it obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have fun</font>

628
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:39,040
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had fun with this one the it was a</font>

629
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:43,210
little frustrating from the perspective

630
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,460
that you know i was on a set timeline I

631
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:48,760
don't know is anybody else here ever do

632
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:51,820
fixed bid type contracts yeah so you

633
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,620
know how it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like if you have 40</font>

634
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:58,360
hours to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> project and you go over</font>

635
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,889
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good yeah so it I went to</font>

636
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the least common denominator hey i know</font>

637
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:06,520
i can bring up that repeater and from

638
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:08,440
there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just knowing knowing that you</font>

639
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,770
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can now start to decode</font>

640
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,240
the packets and in this case so i talked

641
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,430
with the engineer after the engagement

642
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,710
and said all right you know this is

643
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">really kind of messed up he said yeah</font>

644
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:23,610
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fail-safes in place</font>

645
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:28,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">unless you can turn on maintenance mode</font>

646
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:31,179
so the thought is oh if I can figure out

647
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,920
the protocol and how to forge it I can

648
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:37,180
turn on maintenance mode which shuts off

649
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:40,240
the pumps mm-hmm because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

650
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:43,600
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should explain that essentially</font>

651
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,010
what will happen is it's a it's a

652
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,020
self-contained system if it loses

653
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,850
connectivity with its head end it'll

654
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,110
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know turn on the pump set three</font>

655
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:53,199
o'clock in the morning fill up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> water</font>

656
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,699
tower do its thing and then set it to a

657
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,100
certain water level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down pump</font>

658
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,950
if it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance mode it won't do</font>

659
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,270
that so if it's in maintenance mode I

660
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,429
can then turn the pump on and leave it

661
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:08,090
on because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's in maintenance mode</font>

662
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:13,399
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so thank you folks for</font>

663
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:15,350
coming I guess before I fully sign off i

664
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:18,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to take questions but I wanted to</font>

665
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:21,049
thank my wife Heather annoyed the layer

666
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:22,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">1 crew that they've done a fabulous job</font>

667
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:26,090
of putting this together over the last

668
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:29,470
couple of years and then my company for

669
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:41,269
flying me out here and layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 it's all</font>

670
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:49,690
questions so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is has has the</font>

671
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:49,690
radio the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. RP or have I seen I</font>

672
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:55,518
not yet so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is have they</font>

673
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,019
seen it to use or have has a new radio

674
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,749
been used to control commercial radio

675
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:00,860
stuff yet I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally haven't seen it I</font>

676
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:04,399
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if anybody else in the room</font>

677
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,110
is has or hasn't I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

678
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,210
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of that gray area where it's</font>

679
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a prototyping tool and they'll</font>

680
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:14,990
take that prototype and then put it into

681
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,940
a commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> product later on at least I</font>

682
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:19,069
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept behind it is</font>

683
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,020
you can you can do the prototyping very

684
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:25,549
rapidly however you can do the hacking

685
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:28,790
very easily too yeah yeah you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> bake</font>

686
00:34:25,549 --> 00:34:31,129
it into an<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGA later on yeah and you</font>

687
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:33,739
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the firmware is on the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

688
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:35,868
chip that you've made etc etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

689
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:40,790
tested that it works and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> had fun</font>

690
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and see are there 1,000,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font>

691
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,469
you do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the prototype some of the</font>

692
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:47,928
protocol analysis on the signal to

693
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jersey logic this model</font>

694
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:55,109
yeah so they haven't well they don't

695
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:59,310
think they have Modbus over TCP but they

696
00:34:55,109 --> 00:35:02,910
they do have signal flow what they call

697
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:04,650
our bc which is block creation tool so

698
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:08,790
you can create the signal blocks and

699
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:11,190
then write them to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> python script</font>

700
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:15,240
and then have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> python get run on the</font>

701
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">fpga to do the signal processing so you</font>

702
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:24,118
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of that within the radio</font>

703
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:29,070
itself as far as yeah that was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

704
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:30,390
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to say there there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

705
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,750
a couple projects that will take and

706
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,578
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the output of a wireless protocol</font>

707
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:43,070
and dump it into Wireshark so you could

708
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:44,910
look at it yeah yeah no doubt yeah

709
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:48,060
specifically this is just a physical

710
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:51,629
layer tool so that that higher-level

711
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,670
Modbus protocol ideally you know where

712
00:35:51,630 --> 00:36:00,630
sharks should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify it go</font>

713
00:35:53,670 --> 00:36:09,230
hey that's my bus all right any other

714

715
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:17,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">geez all right so what you guys want to</font>

716
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,089
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next 20 minutes</font>

717
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,000
does anybody else want to see anything

718
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:28,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. RP or have any questions</font>

719
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:32,520
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one what are you looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at to</font>

720
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually acquire cards for most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

721
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:39,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">center so most of the spectrum I think</font>

722
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,340
you can get a basic RX and then there's

723
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,530
a couple other the daughter cards that

724
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:47,070
are about 75 bucks a pop the four

725
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:50,090
hundred dollar card I think was the 2.9

726
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:52,410
or 4 gigahertz and up it was very

727
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:55,890
specialized like microwave stuff and I

728
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:59,940
think that's why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so expensive but</font>

729
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:03,299
the the cheaper cards like so the cards

730
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,610
I have in here I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a what was</font>

731
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,400
it a basic rx which will do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

732
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,170
the TV stations and it will do any sort

733
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,040
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> police bands those kind of things I</font>

734
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:17,070
have a 900 megahertz card and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 802 2.4</font>

735
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,600
gigahertz receive so the 800 2.4

736
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,240
gigahertz covers a pretty big spectrum

737
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,069
and then that basic RX covers another

738
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,609
pretty big spectrum and you will even<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

739
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:29,640
like TV stuff like that so so you can

740
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:33,270
get a usrp for about a thousand bucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

741
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,770
think i probably paid 1100 or 1200 for

742
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:40,530
this guy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of expensive hardware</font>

743
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:43,530
but very versatile yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

744
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:47,240
didn't pay it my company paid it thank

745
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,240
thank goodness but

746
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:52,239
the question is are there any chance is

747
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,799
there any chance that other

748
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,319
manufacturers will get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad went</font>

749
00:37:53,799 --> 00:38:00,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">bandwagon I highly doubt it because it's</font>

750
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:04,509
pretty risky for them because Matt<font color="#CCCCCC"> etis</font>

751
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:09,219
or edits research who is the guy who

752
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:13,410
makes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> usrp he makes him himself I</font>

753
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:17,380
mean he's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple person company</font>

754
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:20,709
yeah the specs are but yeah you could

755
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,699
build your own absolutely but I don't

756
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:24,459
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through that</font>

757
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:26,589
process it'd be pretty painstaking to

758
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:29,109
try and develop your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own board I mean</font>

759
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:34,299
you could do it absolutely I'm more

760
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:35,828
power to you I just anyway um no I think

761
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be really cool if other</font>

762
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:40,719
people would come along and build that

763
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,739
that equipment because then you could

764
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,299
have an alternative that would be

765
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:44,579
cheaper ideally you know maybe it

766
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:47,349
doesn't come with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the features that</font>

767
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the u.s. RP has maybe you only have one</font>

768
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:58,539
channel instead of or one side instead

769
00:38:49,779 --> 00:39:03,759
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two sides so should we bring up the</font>

770
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:09,089
spectrum analyzer again all right sweep

771
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:09,089
some space<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so weird that go</font>

772
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:21,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. RP so all the programs i wrote</font>

773
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:26,949
it's it's pretty lame<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't write</font>

774
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:30,538
anything yeah so there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

775
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:35,440
program that I used was the push-to-talk

776
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:38,430
FM narrow FM or yeah narrow FM<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmit</font>

777
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,430
I can show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font>

778
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:52,810
there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of code here so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

779
00:39:47,890 --> 00:40:02,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">your local share a new radio samples in</font>

780
00:39:52,810 --> 00:40:06,430
here usrp and it's this usrp narrowband

781
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:11,980
FM push to talk this is the code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

782
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:29,470
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit so I mean it's basic</font>

783
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:32,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Python</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's and there is man if I'm</font>

784
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:37,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">push-to-talk you know we're talking 497</font>

785
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:44,200
lines of code it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty small here we</font>

786
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:45,790
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> run this and anybody want to</font>

787
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:50,279
transmit on some frequency does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

788
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:52,690
know a good 900 megahertz frequency<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez</font>

789
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so we say nine hundred two</font>

790
00:40:52,690 --> 00:41:04,750
megahertz I don't know oh no I got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

791
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:07,330
rut so here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basic interface</font>

792
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:10,390
that I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just brought it up put it</font>

793
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:13,259
on the frequency<font color="#E5E5E5"> one OOP hit the space</font>

794
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:18,970
bar which then it essentially transmits

795
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:22,120
its that was as complex as I made it it

796
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:25,990
brought the system down what's up that's

797
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,460
what brought the SCADA system down I'm

798
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:32,620
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing up a carrier frequency</font>

799
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:35,080
with some audio on it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly it's</font>

800
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,819
it's simple it's so simple that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

801
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,650
like I just got to attack it this way

802
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,970
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I if I do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything more</font>

803
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,130
complex I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be spinning</font>

804
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,520
spinning my wheels probably not making a

805
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,520
lot of headway

806
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:56,119
so all the call outside on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

807
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:58,640
for every state environment I've been if

808
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:02,750
that means that companies that send out

809
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,299
tech<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5200 500 people to monitor those</font>

810
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">stations individually to keep the pumps</font>

811
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,250
from being shut down<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of ammo or</font>

812
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:13,490
faulty overflowing in oil and gas

813
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,290
environment you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> shut hungry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

814
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,700
can dispose of your water<font color="#CCCCCC"> and properly</font>

815
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,460
and get an environmental bottom to

816
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,509
running a few hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand dollars</font>

817
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:27,050
else there's no default say on how

818
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:30,440
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these manufacturers inside</font>

819
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:31,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">hows it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fails as every dem party does</font>

820
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,860
skated with that was probably the

821
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:40,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">statement every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company developed on</font>

822
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:44,600
their own took out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water network you</font>

823
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:49,910
can cost the company nearly bouncing per

824
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:52,130
per hour on<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah i mean if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can't</font>

825
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:54,589
get water their<font color="#CCCCCC"> residence or if they you</font>

826
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,180
know or if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in I've also</font>

827
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:58,310
worked in like nuclear facilities

828
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,868
nuclear power plants and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

829
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,520
scary because they have to take readings

830
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,780
of everything before they release it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

831
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,250
know if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> release it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they don't</font>

832
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a reading on it they get fined if</font>

833
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,940
they don't release it within a set

834
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,300
amount of time or if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take the</font>

835
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:14,570
reading properly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then report it they</font>

836
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:16,070
get fined I mean the NRC the Nuclear

837
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,619
Regulatory Commission is actually really

838
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:21,230
strict which is good because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

839
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:26,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">rather have that then Oh we'll just</font>

840
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:31,520
release this water thanks Homer don't

841
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:34,369
don't well here let's bring up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Freak</font>

842
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,619
the spectrum analyzer here the waterfall

843
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:41,270
which I think it's really pretty jairo

844
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:42,950
anybody know any other good frequencies

845
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:47,230
so yeah we got it we got a pretty good

846
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:47,230
red bar here somebody else transmitting

847
00:43:50,840 --> 00:44:13,220
it could be blah blah blah test no oh

848
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:25,560
and my being booed off stage already

849
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:26,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">jeez yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one doesn't have a slider</font>

850
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,940
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that so we could take the</font>

851
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:35,340
waterfall mode off and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us</font>

852
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,599
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> little graph lines and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

853
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">there we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see okay this is nine</font>

854
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:46,970
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and five megahertz 905 point 4</font>

855
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:46,970
etc etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can even go out it's the</font>

856
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:57,630
yeah we can make this bigger I don't

857
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,730
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think these</font>

858
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:03,000
these are probably operating the is em

859
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:08,310
in dustrial scientifical and medical

860
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,420
band the handheld radio devices yeah

861
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,799
that'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of fun to transmit on</font>

862
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:19,680
maybe we should try that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for later on in</font>

863
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:23,700
the day here<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoa Oh is I I may be able</font>

864
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tune to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that no I can't I think I can</font>

865
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,750
go down to 800 and that's that's as low

866
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,640
as I can go at least with the two water

867
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,070
daughter boards that I have but with the

868
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,319
other cards you can go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that you</font>

869
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:39,890
know again it's not FCC<font color="#CCCCCC"> Park typed which</font>

870
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,890
is really cool all right

871
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:50,299
yeah they well it's such a low transmit

872
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:52,309
power yeah exactly although yeah even

873
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:56,349
the soap sell stuff isn't blocked which

874
00:45:52,309 --> 00:46:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I thought was kind of surprising so</font>

875
00:45:56,349 --> 00:46:03,260
there's a hand back there one of the

876
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:06,439
first slide you could slide up seeing

877
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,930
you something yes ma five then you can

878
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,799
use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point sniff the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GSM traffic in</font>

879
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:17,049
the Dakota crack the GSM traffic yep yep

880
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:19,400
exactly um yeah that that's where tapi

881
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:22,069
you crossing the legal lines but yeah

882
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,589
that unless your wire tapping your own

883
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:27,079
call apparently at least that's what

884
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:31,940
people have said I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's</font>

885
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:35,210
true but right it's a shared medium but

886
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:38,630
yeah that so the a5 code has been

887
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:41,779
cracked for a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can use</font>

888
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:45,890
the code that's out there already to do

889
00:46:41,779 --> 00:46:51,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so it's pretty slick load it up and</font>

890
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:57,259
go yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPUs to do it even faster than</font>

891
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:58,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. RP so all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i'm</font>

892
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:00,109
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it unless other people</font>
