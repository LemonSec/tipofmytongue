replied your tiny blood message and

44
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,560
there were no whole long lists of blobs

45
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,540
of messages so somewhere along the line

46
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">people figured out hey if i take my file</font>

00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,320
and then break it up into a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,440
pieces and then take those pieces and

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">post them as messages then they would</font>

50
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,500
say there and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> people could read</font>

51
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,820
these messages and turn the back in the

52
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,630
files and we could file share and it was

53
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,310
a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal because she couldn't really</font>

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,660

googling around you know ways to do you

82
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:22,240
know ascii compression or some crap and

83
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,080
lo and behold like two days before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,090

blog that like two days before<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying so</font>

91
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,700
I had Twitter and I got rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

92
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,750
account that I had for a year but I had

93
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:46,979
this idea Twitter uses utf-8 so be cool

94
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,590
if someone could take you know data and

95
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,830
express it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as utf-8 using this encoding</font>

96
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,440
scheme which will come

97
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,820
later and you would get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he</font>

98
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">hypothesizes getting somewhere close to</font>

99
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:06,290
420<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASCII characters per Like Tweet</font>

100
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:08,840
instead of 140 based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their huh yeah</font>

101
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,630
exactly Oh based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on his math</font>

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,159
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like ow oh I found this this</font>

103
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,800
might work um let's let's try that okay

104
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,390
so then I had a engagement by now it's

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,100

106
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,560
weekend so I was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know away</font>

107
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a couple days and on Sunday he calls</font>

109
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,890
again this weekend and like it works I'm

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,900
like what works that thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you found</font>

111
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:37,940
online it works we like did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm like</font>

112
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:39,320
oh oh oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool cool and then by</font>

113
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,760
then it spiraled out of control<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

114
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,349
went over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of you know</font>

115
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,480
consume our lives for a few weeks and

116
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,400
yeah now we have this you know utf-8

117
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,200
expression method for data on Twitter

118
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:56,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's kind of funny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all about</font>

119
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:58,060
it so else happen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know after we</font>

120
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,790
left the drink up it took virus home and

121
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,080
started cracking on the project

122
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,930
initially obviously we can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> post</font>

123
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,789
binary data to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter we just doesn't</font>

124
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,310
was not compatible<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think about a</font>

125
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:13,790
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know encode the data and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bay</font>

126
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,250
64<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed like an obvious choice wasn't</font>

127
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,910
exactly a fish in to increase the the

128
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,650
data size by thirty three percent took a

129
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,360
lot of tweets a lot of chunks where

130
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,239
could we call them now a lot of chunks

131
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,760
to make a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> file even small files</font>

132
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:34,430
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> with bz2 and gzip it still needed a</font>

133
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:37,390
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work so we yeah and then as virus</font>

134
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,830
is saying we moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> into utf-8 smuggling</font>

135
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:43,340
which turned out to be really really

136
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting and that was a really short</font>

137
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,000
amount of time

138
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,620
alright so virus<font color="#E5E5E5"> close or tell CP about</font>

139
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,240
this utf-8 encoding and CP close me hey

140
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,060
we can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> get three or four times</font>

141
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,450
as much data in each tweet as we're

142
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing right now so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I utf-8</font>

143
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,260
that's that Asian characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

144
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,130
thing yeah if you said before sure I can

145
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:18,340
do that so I look it up and utf-8 is

146
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:21,550
just it's similar to a ski and it's

147
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:27,039
backwards compatible so but instead of

148
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting just a normal 127 different</font>

149
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,290
characters you're going to get up to

150
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,450
it's about 1.2 million different

151
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:38,040
combinations so you can fit a lot more

152
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:41,740
data into one character than with a ski

153
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:45,610
it's a variable number of bits bytes so

154
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:49,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you have a large character that's</font>

155
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,610
used in a kanji or something like that

156
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">it might be two bites if you get one of</font>

157
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,130
the more rare ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will be three and</font>

158
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,570
it can actually go up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> four and the</font>

159
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,120
way you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many bytes are in each</font>

160
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,700
character is by the bit pattern of the

161
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,040
first bite so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get to that in the</font>

162
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:11,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide but it can encode anywhere</font>

163
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:13,930
from unicode 0000 through<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 ffff which</font>

164
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,820
like I said is about 1.2 million and if

165
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:21,580
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the actual RFC it's 3629</font>

166
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:24,640
and here's the technical data of what

167
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:29,039
the encoding scheme looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like as you</font>

168
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,120
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the first level is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a 7-bit</font>

169
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,770
character that's any ascii character

170
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,270
will drop right in there if it's

171
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,549
something bigger than an ascii character

172
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,098
you just break it down based on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

173
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:42,490
bits it is if it's 11 bits that will fit

174
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,650
into two bytes 16 and be three bites and

175
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,050
anything larger than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be four</font>

176
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:52,150
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a star next to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 21 bit</font>

177
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:57,390
character because not all 21 bits can be

178
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:57,390
in any position for example

179
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:05,329
f<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> byte needs to be f1 f0</font>

180
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,660
through f4 and it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere in</font>

181
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:11,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">there if it's f5 f6 and up it's not</font>

182
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered a valid utf-8 character so I</font>

183
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,500
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all this and figure it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

184
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the bits we want to use</font>

185
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,940
we're going to go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make all of</font>

186
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,700
our UTF characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> four bytes long and</font>

187
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,130
that should take care of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

188
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,329
we had Frank to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and help us</font>

189
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,660
out with encoding and getting that

190
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:31,660
base64 data into these utf-8 characters

191
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:43,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so the reason base64 is called</font>

192
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,070
base64 is because there is a 64-bit key

193
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,790
space there are the way it's encoded is

194
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,680
that it basically you take an 8-bit

195
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,180
number and then u transpose these six

196
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,010
bits and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> these six bits and then</font>

197
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">these six bits and then you get a base64</font>

198
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,930
encoded character and the way they do

199
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,709
that is using the the printable<font color="#CCCCCC"> ascii</font>

200
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,380
space in order to put data in a method

201
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:10,180
in such a way that it's a ski encoded so

202
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,800
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we consider the last slide in which</font>

203
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,959
let's look at this if we consider the

204
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">last slide you'll notice in the four</font>

205
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,599
byte area there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are six bits we can use</font>

206
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,959
which is totally perfect for base64 so

207
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,279
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we decided to do was is</font>

208
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right slide that is right slide</font>

209
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,660
so what we basically decided to do is

210
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,699
say hey we've got this six bit character

211
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,589
why don't we put this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6-bit character</font>

212
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,300
into each of those values and just set

213
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,040
the first one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know a random</font>

214
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,099
number between f0 + f3 because that

215
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,140
should be a valid utf-8 character and

216
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,709
from here we determined that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

217
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,420
able to encode 18 bits yeah that's the

218
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,510
right math we were able to encode 18

219
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:55,279
bits into each unicode character and in

220
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:56,899
turn we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't do</font>

221
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,550
the math on the fly here but this is

222
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of data we were</font>

223
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,490
able to push up so if you have a

224
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,699
calculator on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone's you may want</font>

225
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:07,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that out but then we realized why</font>

226
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:10,670
are we even doing base64 in general

227
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,479
because it's it's taking off<font color="#CCCCCC"> two bits</font>

228
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,939
when it's in code

229
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,010
it's increasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size of whatever</font>

230
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,459
we're encoding it to so if we take some

231
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:21,380
bzip2 data or some gzip data or any

232
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,239
binary data for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter we're going</font>

233
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to increase the size by quite a bit</font>

234
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we're losing to bits with every</font>

235
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,360
encode so we decided hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> why don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

236
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:32,359
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> encode it directly to the binary</font>

237
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,010
and we started out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the method</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

238
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">was similar to the naive encoding method</font>

239
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,829
that what it did was it took the binary

240
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,260
data and it didn't just completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> skip</font>

241
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:44,839
the base64 method but as we did more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

242
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,370
more research we realized hey Twitter

243
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,079
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> characters</font>

244
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,139
were putting to it and it's corrupting a

245
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,180
lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data so we decided Adam came</font>

246
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:55,790
up with an idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put all 20</font>

247
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,189
bits into each utf-8 character and the

248
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,469
way this works<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we read 20 bits from</font>

249
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,889
either a data stream or a string stream

250
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,120
and we turn that into a number and after

251
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,850
we turn that into a number we realize

252
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay how big is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number if the</font>

253
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,560
number is less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 128 we just encoded</font>

254
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,690
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-bite utf-8 character and on</font>

255
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,709
decode weep at it with all the zeros

256
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,519
that weren't there in the original

257
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:21,079
encode if we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x character for</font>

258
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,529
example or if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a character bigger</font>

259
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:27,500
than 2048 it can code into second into a

260
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">2-byte unit utf-8 character three bytes</font>

261
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,899
and four bytes and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on so</font>

262
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the chart to give you an idea</font>

263
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:39,170
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same chart as earlier but this</font>

264
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:41,690
is the range on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left-hand column we</font>

265
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the range that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encodes into that</font>

266
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,519
certain bite so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a number</font>

267
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,040
between the values of 0 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 27 after</font>

268
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,720
reading our 20 bits we encode it into a

269
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-bite utf-8 character which is</font>

270
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,569
basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ascii range between 0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

271
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:59,000
1 27 anyway if the number is between 128

272
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:03,620
and 2047 then we encode it into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

273
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,610
character etc etc and Adam would you

274
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,610
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data compression</font>

275
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,610
comparison

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,050
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was really interested in how much</font>

277
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,030
gain we've made since our first version

278
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,459
so I went through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers and just</font>

279
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,860
pounded them out everything I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did is</font>

280
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,590
after compression because what your

281
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,600
input file compresses to depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

282
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,850
type of file it is but<font color="#CCCCCC"> after compression</font>

283
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be constant so</font>

284
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:39,250
with the base64 method 2k file after was

285
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:42,100
compressed would be 2700 characters of

286
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:45,400
base64 and since we were just putting

287
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the base64 into twitter as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ASCII it</font>

288
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,010
would take 231 characters and since we

289
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,280
only get 140 per tweet that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it was</font>

290
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,860
taken up so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many messages after we</font>

291
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,589
started putting that base64 data into

292
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the utf-8 it cut it down by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

293
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we store the same number base64</font>

294
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,920
encoded characters but we could fit

295
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,100
three of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> per utf-8 character so we</font>

296
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">only had 911 characters to let up</font>

297
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,330
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter once we got the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pure</font>

298
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,069
utf-8 encoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> working we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

299
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,970
an intermediate step where we were doing

300
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,730
19 bits because that top bit hurt yeah

301
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:28,600
the top bit was causing some issues so

302
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:30,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best case scenario it take 820 utf-8</font>

303
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,690
characters to get that 2k of data and

304
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,550
worst case scenario is 861 i'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

305
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,350
say that a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we finished</font>

306
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,910
that up and now it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

307
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,220
a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and twenty for every 2k of</font>

308
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,219
data so it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple calculation</font>

309
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,740
what about the restrictions CP

310
00:14:50,610 --> 00:15:00,510
oh I love this musical chairs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

311
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,390
during our<font color="#E5E5E5"> research into this</font>

312
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,089
application we kept bumping into the

313
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate-limiting and IP limiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

314
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter in forces which is about 100</font>

315
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:15,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">tweets an hour and some I think per hour</font>

316
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:18,689
per IP unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a wireless it</font>

317
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,920
accounts but long story short i emailed

318
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter and i explained a little bit</font>

319
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,089
about what we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and essentially</font>

320
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,750
said we're starting very very small

321
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:29,459
files in your cert on your service and

322
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,230
we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while I said account to</font>

323
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,719
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> our research six hours later</font>

324
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,570
they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and they said good luck</font>

325
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,790
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your research so if they ever say</font>

326
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:44,070
that we're abusing their system I i feel

327
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:46,380
i have consent um yeah 20,000 per hour

328
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,480
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> white listed account never really</font>

329
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,269
gonna bump into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that limit but it's nice</font>

330
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,930
to you know have a nice giant toy to

331
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:56,279
play with um as far as I piercers can go

332
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:01,640
it doesn't really matter if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

333
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:04,260
white listed username yeah that's good

334
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that you can do it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your the one</font>

335
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,010
accounts but I could have give them an

336
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:11,310
IP address as well but I didn't I just

337
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,050
see the one account you can email I

338
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,510
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email but you can find it on</font>

339
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,849
their website and contact them about

340
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,980
getting a white listed account for any

341
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:30,000
reason necessary Frankie you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to set</font>

342
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:31,440
up a demo<font color="#CCCCCC"> like no yes there we go yes so</font>

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,630
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> demonstration</font>

347
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:47,880
source code and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff on it we're doing</font>

348
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:50,760
what gee<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks so no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll come</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hahaha so what you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to</font>

351
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">do hang on Apple is failing well I'm</font>

352
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:05,290
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking through it basically on</font>

353
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:08,559
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk contains on this disk contains</font>

354
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:11,199
some basic Python files and download<font color="#E5E5E5"> pi</font>

355
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,879
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a restricted version a very</font>

356
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,679
limited version of the actual proof of

357
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,660
concept so what we're all going to do

358
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,390
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have internet which is not right</font>

359
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,530
now which we weren't depending on hoping

360
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a network up so we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

361
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">play with this together we can we're</font>

362
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,040
using that cool guys cell phone for

363
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:34,120
internet access can you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bridge</font>

364
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this life Oh hard no we yeah I know this</font>

365
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:42,969
guy I meant how you I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

366
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">um you're going to want to move the</font>

367
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,710
files off the city into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a writable</font>

368
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,290
directory and when you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

369
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:55,600
pie it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> download twat FS via</font>

370
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:56,860
twat FS yo dawg so you'll be the

371
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,740
download the source code via the proof

372
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,439
of concept application and in there is

373
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,270
going to have a twat FS top high which

374
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,520
you can modify to contain your

375
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:10,000
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> username and password and</font>

376
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:13,030
upload and download your own files<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frank</font>

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">too all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see here on</font>

378
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:19,570
my thumb drive here the files<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have are</font>

379
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:25,300
just some stripped down versions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

380
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:29,129
we have and if we look at the download

381
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:32,290
code here all we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have here is</font>

382
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,179
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stripped-down downloader of the</font>

383
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:38,080
original code and what we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

384
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:41,170
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the download script and it</font>

385
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,540
should download twat FS pie and actually

386
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:47,470
a few other things such as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture and</font>

387
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:49,960
perhaps a text file so if the live demo

388
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:54,660
gods don't hate me this should run just

389
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,660
fine here we go

390
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,710
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna get pelted aren't I yeah</font>

391
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:04,129
doesn't like it's working through number

392
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:14,360
patient yeah it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

393
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:15,920
phone where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mouse hang on let's</font>

394
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:21,520
test the internet to that would be a

395
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:30,950
good idea hey the internet works so whoa

396
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:33,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">now what I wanted to do no all right</font>

397
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,500
maybe if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over here oh of course</font>

398
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,450
it failed live demo has failed what I

399
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,610
think that might be because what is that

400
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,710
error oh yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the</font>

401
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,000
internet was slow apparently so now that

402
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:59,620
I know the internet is working again let

403
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:59,620
me try running it one more time yeah

404
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,580
apparently

405
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:16,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right I'm not sure if it's the</font>

406
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:19,359
download or so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the actual yeah</font>

407
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:35,079
all right let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try one more that's not</font>

408
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:36,339
even canceling I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we don't</font>

409
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:41,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original we only have the</font>

410
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:43,178
downloader no I just have the downloader

411
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,469
there I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on my thumb drive</font>

412
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:49,929
that's the issue fantastic well look at

413
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that internet problems yeah this is</font>

420
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:32,039

421
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,899
would you like to explain unstoppable

422
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,609
you know I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> expecting the demo to</font>

423
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:42,039
fail on some sort of level but that was

424
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:44,829
I'm sorry yeah um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what can</font>

425
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,479
twitter do to stop twat FS<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean even</font>

426
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:47,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">if they'd want to I mean I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

427
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:52,479
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly an abuse of their</font>

428
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:55,779
system I've consent by the way now right

429
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:57,579
now H file time line is wrapped in

430
00:21:55,779 --> 00:22:00,249
header chunks which contain meta

431
00:21:57,579 --> 00:22:03,609
information about the file the<font color="#CCCCCC"> file name</font>

432
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:05,919
the encoding type and a few other small

433
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:07,359
details I suppose they could block

434
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,849
tweets containing those headers but we

435
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,379
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just change those headers you're</font>

436
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:13,928
going to block the accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that use the</font>

437
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:17,529
the application we need to make new ones

438
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:19,329
are free and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one I mean I</font>

439
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:20,499
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know develop detection</font>

440
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:22,119
algorithms and analyze your incoming

441
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:23,210
tweets they can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep their</font>

442
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:26,059
servers up in the middle of

443
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:30,470
days I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they're going to be</font>

444
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:32,360
wasting cycles on on fixing this I mean

445
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,779
they can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said all</font>

446
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">properly so i really doubt that's going</font>

447
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:41,029
to happen they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't want to</font>

448
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,470
disable support for utf-8 because

449
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:45,710
they're they're really big in<font color="#E5E5E5"> japan</font>

450
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:52,070
they're moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> into new territories it's</font>

451
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:54,830
just not<font color="#CCCCCC"> an option then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm that would</font>

452
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,600
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep they went directly to the</font>

453
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:02,779
database for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweet before they</font>

454
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:04,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably will which is yeah but if it's</font>

455
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:07,039
propagated then it's the it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

456
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,720
out there right but then they can remove

457
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,710
it I mean it's once it's out its out but

458
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,850
then they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just remove it so it's</font>

459
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,520
out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of little bit time</font>

460
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,110
one way we thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they could</font>

461
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,820
develop an algorithm that could detect

462
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,580
if you have maybe five or six different

463
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,520
languages of characters in one file or

464
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,610
in one tweet rather because there's

465
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">really no reason anyone would ever tweet</font>

466
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,059
in every character being a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

467
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,710
language there's also no reason for you

468
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:36,740
to tweet mahjong tiles which are

469
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:39,080
apparently in utf-8 and as far as making

470
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,149
more restrictions people I mean non

471
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,070
developers are bumping into the 100

472
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:49,250
tweets per hour limit these people have

473
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:51,020
no lives but but it happens much less<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

474
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,860
us hackers but you know I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

475
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:56,450
know yeah so there's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean they</font>

476
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,590
can do some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when it comes</font>

477
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,000
right down to it they can't do it

478
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">without alienating a lot of their users</font>

479
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:12,919
yeah let me pull that<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vienna</font>

networks wait if the internet works cuz

481
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:21,159

been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to identify where's here</font>

you can if you actually view the source

504
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,559
code there's actually stuff here but

505
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:51,590
Twitter is just poked<font color="#E5E5E5"> by RSS feed okay</font>

earlier this week there was another

518
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,529
person working along the same sort of

519
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:51,460
vain Mona tweeted<font color="#E5E5E5"> too yeah yeah cool his</font>

520
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:55,929
um his<font color="#CCCCCC"> utf-8 library only allows him to</font>

521
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:58,750
smuggle was like 230 bits is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yummy like</font>

522
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:02,590
movie did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fun vice 140 tweets to</font>

523
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:04,419
200 or not 140 tweets 140 bytes to 280

524
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:07,928
bytes he only doubled it right we have

525
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:10,870
350 bite or something like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's yeah something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that also his</font>

527
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,789
method to getting to the final product

528
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,769
use an approximation algorithm so when

529
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:27,129
you get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> f which is a rough image of</font>

530
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:28,779
the file this is the exact file who else

531
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is susceptible so this is nifty but you</font>

532
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:31,590
know it works on every side there's no

533
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:36,070
reason it only has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on Twitter</font>

534
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:37,449
the only real major bonus to it being on

535
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,600
Twitter aside from the fact that a bunch

536
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it is Twitter pushes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

537
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,090
cell phones most social networking

538
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:47,740
systems don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so it's possible</font>

539
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,330
for you to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like right cell</font>

540
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,710
phone applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll just read off</font>

541
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,139
the GPRS stream without getting online

542
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,630
and download files<font color="#CCCCCC"> contesto for</font>

543
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:58,389
malicious activity who knows but yeah

544
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,980
from you know pick your number<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chan to</font>

545
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:02,229
myspace to facebook to anything with a

546
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:07,320
form this works any place that you know

547
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:10,110
will accept utf-8 is susceptible and

548
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,139
there are a bunch of potential uses

549
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:16,389
pretty much the week<font color="#CCCCCC"> after we finished</font>

550
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:19,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">the like horribly alpha version which is</font>

551
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:21,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently still horrible of the client</font>

552
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,019
I kind of called a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and was</font>

553
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,789
like hey I guess we did over the weekend

554
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:26,889
and the response was always oh yeah we

555
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:28,919
did some Twitter stuff too and people

556

<font color="#CCCCCC">have thrown all kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ideas from</font>

00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,580
posting pictures to you know posting

558
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:35,320
torrent files on different streams and

559
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,649
using each stream as a download queue

560
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,030
instead of using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a torrent</font>

561
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,190
and from using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a torrent tracker</font>

562
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,480
so that your request for which bites you

563
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,670
won't go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Twitter stream that way</font>

564
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,930
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raa and people won't be</font>

567
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,860
files it's a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get stuff around but</font>

568
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,120
social bookmarking you know taking

569
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,530
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> file snippets from different</font>

570
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,250
blogs and moving them around crypto

571
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,120
stuff you know subscribing as a

572
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,680
subscribing to a tweet and having that

573
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,840
be the second factor in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-factor</font>

574
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,000
authentication scheme you know RSA style

575
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff payload delivery for like</font>

576
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,750
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOTS or you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if you have a</font>

577
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,430
botnet that infects a bunch of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

578
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,020
so you cracked wheat deck right and your

579
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,460
bot goes everywhere and affects a bunch

580
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,840
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it decides it wants</font>

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to get that around well</font>

583
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,210
if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just read the data off of a</font>

584
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:23,390
Twitter stream we're gonna do block

585
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:25,210
Twitter from tweetdeck yeah there's a

586
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:29,800
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun to theorize but</font>

587
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:32,630
we shall see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what people come up with um</font>

588
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:37,669
we're done if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are questions we've</font>

592
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:55,010

593
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:57,200
twat FS hopefully yes I definitely

594
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,879
definitely plan on writing a fuse that

595
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,710
fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then playing the help of</font>

596
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,960
others in order to do it cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean come</font>

597
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,640
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your reading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and writing so slowly</font>

598
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,560
but you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over Twitter how</font>

599
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,850
funny is that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just perfect so</font>

600
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,070
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other kind of things if you guys</font>

601
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:16,969
found when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know doing research on</font>

602
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter the RSS feed let me let me</font>

603
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:27,230
explain this the RSS feed haha insider

604
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">trading with questions the RSS feed</font>

605
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:34,820
seems to kind of barf on single<font color="#CCCCCC"> bite</font>

606
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:37,220
utf-8 encoding one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways we encode</font>

607
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:40,730
the data is after doing all the utf-8

608
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">encoding we're going to run into the</font>

609
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:45,260
last byte which is probably not going to

610
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,390
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 bits set so we append a</font>

611
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,480
number that just represents how many

612
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:52,760
bits are there and when you view the

613
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,860
that stream on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter it shows up as</font>

614
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven which is absolutely what it's</font>

615
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,600
supposed to be when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you view it in the</font>

616
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:02,750
RSS feed it's an asterisk which is not

617
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,668
seven it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like 42 and that's</font>

618
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:08,390
way out there so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> various</font>

619
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:10,549
problems in decoding from the RSS feed

620
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:13,070
that don't show up on the Twitter page

621
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:15,290
itself so that is one problem that's

622
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:19,899
very interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

623
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:25,460
it does that but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> workarounds no</font>

624
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:32,660
I wish I knew no but that is a good next

625
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:37,130
step sounds like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 minus 0 words</font>

626
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:42,470
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> robust should not be used don't</font>

627
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:45,740
give it back this time we done any more

628
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,540
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well we had a lot of</font>

629
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,169
fun screw around with Twitter yeah the

630
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,168
body very much
