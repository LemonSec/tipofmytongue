00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,820
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not a conventional talk for a</font>

9
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,140
security con in many ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you hear</font>

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,820
a lot about code and you hear a lot

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,110
about you know all the real important

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,030
technical matters that you've been

13
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,979
seeing featured on all these talk tracks

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,690
and no it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't know maybe I</font>

15
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,060
mean I dig here and you talk about guns

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,530
but let's see where this goes I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,619
mention this not only because I like

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,690
injecting locks into our lives as much

19
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,770
as we ever can like where can you put

20
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,810
better locks<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't think you</font>

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,520
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also because I really think it</font>

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:28,530
applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of us who have to</font>

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">travel a lot and fly a lot and most of</font>

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,159
you probably are flying not for pleasure

25
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,110
but for work because you know you've got

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got gear you've got shit you want to</font>

27
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,740
take the more the regulations have

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,390
tightened how much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can bring easily</font>

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,490
onto the plane like you can't bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine</font>

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,940
pack it in your checked luggage we're

34
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,920
putting more and more expensive stuff in

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,619
our check bags so we can do our job and

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,429
our bags don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any real security</font>

37
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,560
outside of this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a solution so</font>

38
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,879
Who am I I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the lockpick</font>

00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,319
events<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of go to a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of cons now</font>

41
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,789
since I don't have a real job anymore

42
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,759
unless you want to hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for some</font>

43
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:10,050
audit and most of these cons I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

44
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,809
can't just get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my truck and roll I</font>

45
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,280
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly I've had baggage problems</font>

46
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,250
like the rest of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had baggage</font>

47
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,010
theft in the past my bags get you no

48
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,720
hassle all the time after a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad</font>

49
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,879
episode of theft where I had to fill out

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,260
forms and you know I lost all my pics

51
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,910
and my knives and I said this this

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,079
fucking<font color="#CCCCCC"> sucks i've got to do something</font>

53
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,690
besides this there's got to be a better

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">way and now there is a better way now i</font>

55
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,420
have hard sided psycho look and luggage

56
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,569
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy duty padlocks that I use all</font>

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,149
the time when I fly these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TSA</font>

58
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,760
compliant locks these are proper ass

59
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,040
crazy padlocks which no one can really

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,560
get through you might think that's not

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,269
allowed it in fact is allowed and the

62
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,290
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's allowed is because I fly</font>

63
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,230
with firearms

64
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,798
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I get on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a plane it's</font>

65
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,480
absolutely simple to do it's the easiest

66
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing in the world and it results in</font>

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,179
amazing security you can all do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,920
much more simply than you might realize

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,420
the end result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all this this is that</font>

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,708
someone asked me once halfway through my

71
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,390
talk he was like so does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean I</font>

72
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,489
could put like laptops in the bag too

73
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,779
I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that's yeah you see what I</font>

74
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,220
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you you're following along</font>

75
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this talk is</font>

76
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,959
about how the law works in your favor to

77
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">use better locks in your stuff when you</font>

78
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,879
fly and how it's simple some standards

79
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,680
you should be aware of first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

80
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,149
though airlines are private carriers

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,280
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make up their own rules there</font>

82
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,290
are federally mandated standards that

83
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,260
everyone up you know has to comply with

84
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,209
for flying with firearms they're

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,470
relatively you know uniform by every

86
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,659
airline every airline tweaks it a little

87
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,060
bit ultimately it just means your bag

88
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,980
has to be a heavy<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-sided case can't</font>

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,260
have any soft bag for the main thing

90
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,780
containing the firearm and you have to

91
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,090
have a lock<font color="#CCCCCC"> that only you have the key</font>

92
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,159
to no one else is allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have access</font>

93
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">no one else is allowed to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,470
bag it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really amazing when you tell</font>

95
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:03,510
people that that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TSA no one's</font>

96
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,099
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it's true no one is allowed</font>

97
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,599
in without you standing right there your

98
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,849
bags can still be screened will tell you

99
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,228
<font color="#CCCCCC">all about how but if you declare your</font>

100
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,108
weapon they'll give you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

101
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">know thing to fill out there you go from</font>

102
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:18,299
that point on your bags can be properly

103
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,940
heavily locked certain specifics as I

104
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,770
say it does have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a hard case your</font>

105
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,719
ammo if you are traveling with any ammo

106
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,430
it's a separate classification airlines

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,380
have their own regs on that the standard

108
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is 11 pounds you're limited to of ammo</font>

109
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,599
but not everyone applies to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no</font>

110
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,490
outside labels is something I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

111
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:38,580
remind<font color="#CCCCCC"> people of because airlines get</font>

112
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,400
this wrong and I've had you know

113
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,630
arguments right there on the terminal

114
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,310
saying no you're breaking the law<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

about that it shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a gas like</font>

139
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,870
it's the health of our society when

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,549
average citizens are just seen walking

253
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,370
weapons that little sticker I saw

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,839
applied to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual baggage tag</font>

putting something on my back there no

257
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:24,890
that's just the TSA has inspected this

258
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,720
bag if it was screened specially the

259
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,770
other day<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got this slapped on my bag I</font>

260
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,020
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if that's because I suddenly</font>

261
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,089
got elite status on my star alliance or

262
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,199
if that's the new airport trick thing to

263
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:35,870
like oh there's guns in here

264
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,580
should have asked somebody and I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

265
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,360
think these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> TSA things I was like</font>

266
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,560
well that's kind of neat you know

267
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,060

268
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,859
hologram<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan you know if you know what</font>

269
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is not now you can't like fake it</font>

270
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">but now they've started producing ones</font>

271
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,900
that aren't hologram they've just made

272
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,330
these little this has been cleared by

273
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,130
the TSA orange stickers so create your

274
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,460
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what that means</font>

275
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,439
for bag security some international

276
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,090
countries don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> our laws obviously</font>

277
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,440
you will sometimes see tags on the

278
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,480
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your bags for international</font>

279
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,220
travel it's totally possible to fly to

280
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
foreign domains with firearms as well

281
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,440
just call ahead find out what the policy

282
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,079
is where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going more international</font>

283
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,580
notes besides the tagging people ask me

284
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,320
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't it you know hectic</font>

285
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,770
clearing all those different custom hops

286
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,870
and everywhere else you're going no not

a really psycho padlock that weighs a

you know kind of a heavy like pistol

413
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,430
that weighs a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> pounds it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible I</font>

414
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,079
wouldn't recommend it to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your bag on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that but I had to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it once and it</font>

426
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,670
worked out pretty well can you put a

427
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:04,670
firearm in a hard case inside of another

428
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,740
case yes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some really</font>

429
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,010
nice cases this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a TSA approved case</font>

430
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,600
that CHS let me check out here there's a

431
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,660
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things I will say about that</font>

432
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">one it defeats this whole like I am</font>

433
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,370
extra locking all my other stuff idea

434
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,400
you know you could put this in like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

435
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,650
duffel<font color="#CCCCCC"> bag and it's allowed it's also</font>

436
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,329
however the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way that I am aware of</font>

437
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that firearms have been stolen from</font>

438
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,220
luggage in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past stealing a small</font>

439
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,250
case out of a larger case that was not

440
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,910
locked or not locked properly is

441
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,200
something that's been a problem at

442
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,870
o'hare airport in a few other places

443
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,580
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never ever known of a firearm</font>

444
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,470
that's been stolen out of a large

445
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,480
unopenable bag I mean the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way is to</font>

446
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,310
boost the whole piece of luggage which

447
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,260
really doesn't happen that often stuff

448
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,819
that gets stolen from<font color="#E5E5E5"> baggage areas is</font>

449
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,260
it be someone shoves it in a cargo pant

450
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,020
where they shove it in their little sack

451
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,420
that they have for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their lunch that day</font>

452
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,430
the real interesting trick what I say is

453
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just functional firearms if you're</font>

454
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a gun person you know get out but be</font>

455
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say or whatever maybe you</font>

456
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,770
live in some you know communist state

457
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,839
like I got to go hawaii for Chaka Khan

458
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,060
in June it's a real sob story I know I'm

459
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,950
really troubled by that know if you go

460
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,920
somewhere that's very gun unfriendly you

461
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,709
can use

462
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,529
firearms that aren't lethal firearms and

463
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,638
they still apply under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the law i'm going</font>

464
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you and talk about some things</font>

465
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are I should just let you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they</font>

466
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,100
are both non-lethal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any event</font>

467
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,560
they are unloaded and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

468
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,779

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,250
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're all clear that's just I</font>

470
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:35,189
feel it's appropriate to mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys see any gear all of</font>

the following things count in one way or

473

another as firearms under the law

476
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,310
lethal firearms completely count any

counts as a firearm you declare it flare

guns this is a you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> German gecko</font>

flare pistol beautifully made very cheap

to brandish or threaten someone it's a

491
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:26,159
firearm under federal law that works

492
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,870
wonderfully if you ever think you're

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">traveling somewhere that's not gonna end</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">prop now it looks unbelievably real</font>

497
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,600
that's because it does take a mo not

504
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,928
that if you say I'm checking this as a

505

fire I don't know if that's skirting the

law a bit but I mean I use it when I

were told by someone oh I need I need to

the firearm for purposes of FFL transfer

transporting one I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

526
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,800
declare it not because i'm expecting to

527
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,480
leverage the law in my favor I might get

528
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,159
someone looking at me funny but I would

529
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,880
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel more comfortable declaring it</font>

530
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,580
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the right thing</font>

531
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,930
to do I have if you want to listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

532
00:18:52,580 --> 00:19:03,649
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website or we could play it later</font>

533
00:18:53,930 --> 00:19:04,970
I'm sorry go ahead you said yeah in the

534
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,920
case of the receiver what I want to

535
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,170
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would not just to comply</font>

536
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,730
but I would want to check it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all</font>

537
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,590
those purposes but I would be surprised

538
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,940
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be surprised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if someone said</font>

539
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,230
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think we have to declare this</font>

540
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,730
sir yes Lloyd question what about sounds

541
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,380
I've never thought about that because a

542
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:24,290
sound suppressor under the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NFA is</font>

543
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,080
legally the weapon itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would expect</font>

544
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:29,480
that it's a good idea to declare it just

545
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,129
because you are under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law you are</font>

546
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,260
transporting a weapon through this air

547
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,550
carrier I would expect quizzical looks

548
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,550
and people who don't understand

549
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">treatment I don't know about other</font>

550
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,120
airlines well good<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know one airline I</font>

551
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,340
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember which one I know there is</font>

552
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">an airline that despite you despite the</font>

553
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,120
fact you could fly with firearms on them

554
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,940
they specifically say no sound

555
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,709
suppression devices interesting yeah a

556
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,080
lot of airlines have really strange

557
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,910
one-off policies that don't conform I

558
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,770
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how that's that's</font>

559
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,810
fair and proper visiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a common</font>

560
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrier they should not be able to</font>

561
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,990

interstate transportation of your own

565
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,830
weapons but that's a whole other spiel

566
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,020
speaking of other airlines I have whole

567
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,330

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,270
these determinations ultimately i said

587
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,159
here's the federal standard consider you

588
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,530
know hardcase 11 pounds of ammo blah

that what it what extra policies do they

591
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,980
have sometimes they will have what I'll

592
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,570
consider idiot packing policies where

593
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,280
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you put an infinite</font>

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed to make you use more bags and</font>

599
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,899
transparently retarded sometimes they

600
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,760
are fussy about ammo whether it can be

601
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,530
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same case or not the federal law</font>

602
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,510
has no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it some airlines do</font>

603
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,399
some don't like if your ammo is in

604
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,470
anything other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original box all</font>

605
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,990
of this is in great great detail where I

report the occasional boneheaded staffer

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,530
skip past people<font color="#E5E5E5"> when i'm checking</font>

638

876
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,740
they expel a projectile yeah mm-hmm so I

877
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,210
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard that</font>

00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,480
want to limit their sphere of liability

880
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,769
they want you to comply with this

881
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,049
declaration as much as that Kendall do

882

probably kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a pain in the ass</font>

887
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,879
logistically it is um I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

the 1700 series of rifle case for almost

899
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,240
the main reason besides the fact that

900

they're light and crush proof and all

901
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,230

everything out well that's awesome yeah

915
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:07,690

00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,240
15-dollar mortar case they they cost

917
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,400
more

918

921
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:22,360
two hundred dollars or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred fifty</font>

922
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:24,580

00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,469
awesome i'll check it out if you're

924
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,360
traveling with just ammunition do you

<font color="#E5E5E5">have to lock your bag I've gotten</font>

927
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,149
different answers when I've specifically

928
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,590
called about that question some people

929
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,180
say yes you absolutely should other

930
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,790
people have told me no I've never

931
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,800
personally tried it again I would say

932
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,690
it's one of those things where if you

933
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,550
are just I want to bring this ammo it's

934
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,680
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea to declare and see what they</font>

935
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:51,190
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to just want err on the side</font>

936
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,050
of caution<font color="#E5E5E5"> but don't count on it always</font>

937
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to work in your favor don't use</font>

938
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,600
this as you're trying to leverage the

939
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,880
law<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your favor because you might not</font>

940
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">get someone who's going to you know not</font>

941
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,200
give you a hard time about it the other

942
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,880
thing i will mention as I should have

943
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,880
slipped this in earlier any of these

944
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,210
small cases like this one the CHS his

945
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,120
case that is a lockable case any other

946
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,730
cases that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lockable like they have</font>

947
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,819
the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop you know for the padlock</font>

948
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:21,639
cut that off if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try it this</font>

949
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,470
way I worry and I have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> friend that</font>

950
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,659
they did this once they said oh well you

951
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:27,219
don't have to lock that whole big bag I

952
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,929
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your little gun</font>

953
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:30,219
case can you can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take your padlock</font>

954
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:32,319
and put it on that that would make life

955
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:33,759
easier and they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to insist</font>

956
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he didn't now thankfully the path</font>

957
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,990
the shackle wouldn't fit through the

958
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,910
loops but don't if you're really worried

959
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,080
about them trying to scam me because the

960
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,339
more people do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to try</font>

961
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,319
to cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their overhead of work</font>

962
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,240
consider that don't be like oh I'm going

963
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lock my little case and then I'm</font>

964
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,989
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lock my big case I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

965
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">people they say no we have to this lock</font>

966
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:54,669
has to come off I've seen locks cut off

967
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:56,290
the big case before so be mindful of

968
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll don't give them an out</font>

969
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,170
don't give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a direction they can</font>

970
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,810
send you and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh I'm sorry I</font>

971
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,960
can't I'd like to comply but I can't yes

972
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,960
sir

973
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:12,340
the types of locks you can and cannot

974
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,850
use the reason I bring it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

975
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,430
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly applies to what you're</font>

976
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,610
talking about with these the case that I

977
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">loaned you those are called a secure it</font>

978
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:26,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're they're manufactured for like</font>

979
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,000
the American firearms certification and

980
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,010
instructors Institute or something weird

981
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,310
like that but none they have a

982
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:36,220
combination lock model so if a

983
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:39,460
combination if a combination lock does

984
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,959
not qualify then you it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

985
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,460
for transport and they're inexpensive

986
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,020
and they're small but then you'd still

987
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,170
have to lock your bag combination locks

988
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:50,110
do qualify the law<font color="#CCCCCC"> states they must be</font>

989
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:52,240
locked with a a lock<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the law</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> states</font>

990
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:55,450
no one else gets the key or combination

991
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason the tsa locks</font>

992
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,299
are not approved<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's well known</font>

993
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,910
there's a master<font color="#E5E5E5"> key that everyone has</font>

994
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,710
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would also state that if</font>

995
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,049
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a generic mass produced like</font>

996
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,550
the firearm trainers kit and every one

997
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,500
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has the same key for like range</font>

998
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,030
safety purposes you could make the case

999
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,770
that wouldn't be approved for this

1000
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,140
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the key is universally so</font>

1001
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,160
well known but yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> port</font>

1002
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the part you can really get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1003
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,490
someone's face<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they say we need</font>

1004
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,290
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say no you don't you you don't</font>

1005
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,029
get the key the key never can leave my

1006
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:24,160
possession same thing with a combination

1007
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,170
you say no I know the combination I'm

1008
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,430
not going to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a neat idea but</font>

1009
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,170
that combination thing would be you

1010
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,819
could always claim i bought this on ebay

1011
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,140
i don't know the combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

1012
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,380
lock the inner case if someone really

1013
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:39,210
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you static so yeah there's that</font>

1015
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:51,880
mm-hmm you know once you're there how do

1016
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,830
you secure your firearm with your

1017
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,750
destination so getting to and going

1018
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,000
beyond the airport itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a few</font>

1019
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,230
things we should definitely cover tied

1020
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,330
to it and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna get to yours i</font>

weapons are legal where I am and I have

1028
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,570
these firearms and I'm transporting

1029
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,640

locked and unloaded I train I get to

1031
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the law treats a common</font>

1032
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,040
carrier airline is another interstate

1033
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,170
highway so the safe passage<font color="#E5E5E5"> provision</font>

1034
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,480
applies you can show up and you say here

1035

1037
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,549
People's Republic I could land here they

1038
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,020
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm staying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1039
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,880
California they it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> their business</font>

1040
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know and they want to limit their</font>

1041
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,030
liability so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> airlines won't know you</font>

1042
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,320
could make the case oh I'm getting in a

1043
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,660
car and driving a<font color="#E5E5E5"> defcon with these</font>

1046
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,790

1047
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:55,359
paddle somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of Hawaii if they</font>

1048
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:56,740
know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to Hawaii so but um yeah</font>

1049
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">so there's there's that to consider</font>

1050
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,879
specifically how do I keep things these

1051
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,930
usually I can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of live out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1052
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,390
these when I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a destination</font>

1053
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,859
the locks are heavy enough and I can put

1054
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,650
a Shane or something on them and chained

1055
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:10,990
him to a pipe if early want to yeah i

1056
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,550
mean at Def Con we have so much in the

1057
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,560
way of crazy crap in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our rooms</font>

1058
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:16,180
that it doesn't really matter but yeah

1059
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it safe like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't notify hotels</font>

1060
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,000
or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no no no if you guys</font>

1061
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,890
ever try to do that or don't do that I

1062
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,510
never tell them<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm transporting is</font>

1063
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,100
again the law is in your favor if you

1064
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,150
are rent you're the tenant of that room

1065
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,040
for the night that is your dwelling

1066
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,140
under the law and they I don't believe

1067
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,460
are supposed to be able to restrict what

1068
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,859
you can again have I'm not a lawyer I

1069
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,030
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for sure but yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1070
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:39,730
what I do I just keep the shit lock

1071
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:43,740
there anyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I guess that's it</font>

1072
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,740
we can go drink thank you

1073
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,040
