1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,799
for those of you that don't know paul

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,320
paul's been doing stuff with computers

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,519
for a long time

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,439
um like i hope i'm still doing stuff

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
whoa see where i could yeah yeah no

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
as that that just went harsh really

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,680
quick

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,599
uh paul paul has a lot of knowledge to

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,439
drop on us but i guess if anyone's ever

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
been told to shift left

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
um reading your intro when we got the

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
cfp was like yep we need that one right

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,399
in there so

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,600
paul's going to talk to us about

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,079
devsecops because that's easy right and

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,840
shifting left and and show us how to do

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,079
it

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,960
i imagine let's see yeah that's thank

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,280
you

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
make paul feel welcome thank you

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
that was that was that was a great intro

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,280
cheers right

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,360
cheers um i will be having to like deal

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,680
with two um turntables here so

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,120
the the transition between the slides

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,079
will be a little bit more complicated

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,879
than i wanted but

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,799
anyhow that having been said boom

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,400
i have been in the game a long time

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
right that was not a lie

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
so i put that in my uh i started uh

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,600
i started in the platform world back in

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,640
93.

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,479
so i started my first computer store in

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,040
1996 my first isp in 97

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,520
started contracting then and then 20

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,600
some years later i'm here

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,520
with a startup based out of the gold

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
coast queensland

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,079
as originally a detroit boy but having

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,960
been in the game

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,479
a long time i worked for a lot of great

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
companies right here's my

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,320
i'm doing my turntable thing here i've

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,159
worked some for some great big companies

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:40,799
and i've

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
also worked for some small companies um

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,200
and my start with devops right

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,960
before devops was the thing was way back

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
in the 90s a friend of mine had a

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,280
startup that was in the office next to

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,759
us and they were building

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,439
software there was a spin-off of

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,600
spillman systems in northern utah and

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,399
they did

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,439
software for jails prosecutors and

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,960
police organizations

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,439
so even in the 90s you can imagine that

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,399
 was strict

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
right there was a lot of requirements

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
there that they had to meet even back in

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,319
the 90s

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,480
so they brought me in and most of my

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,760
background up until that point had been

65
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,280
on large distributed unix

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,840
systems doing a lot of hardening i did a

67
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
lot of linux

68
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
firewall the original ip firewall before

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
ip chains

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
who who actually worked on ip chains

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
anybody i knew there was gonna be some

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,800
hands i knew there's gonna be some hands

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
um ippy firewall was great um

74
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
worked with them and that was really

75
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
kind of my intro to working with

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,400
development teams and i've been doing

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,920
that off and on for a long time since

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,800
then

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,160
um and here's my turntable

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
tapes and the microphone

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,280
all right what are we here to talk about

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,680
today we're not here to talk about me

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
we're here to talk about solarwinds and

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
also devops devsecops right

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,200
so the first thing i want to say is that

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,920
the a lot of what we heard about the

87
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,360
solarwinds attack

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
especially for infosec has concentrated

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,599
on the multi-stage

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,200
malware loader and some of these other

91
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,720
kind of technical components that we as

92
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,239
an infosec

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,440
kind of community can wrap our heads

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
around right and unfortunately

95
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,920
we've missed a lot of the opportunity to

96
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,200
talk about

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
development right because the reality is

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,640
when i started working with developers

99
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,319
back in the early 90s

100
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,040
we were effectively deploying insecure

101
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
applications back then

102
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
but guess what we did it in the data

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,239
center and we had the protection

104
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,480
of all this kit and all this gear around

105
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,360
it right

106
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,599
so if we messed up somebody else had our

107
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,400
back

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
today it's not really like that um

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,799
so and i think that part of the

110
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,200
part of the um part of that narrative

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,239
um has been because we don't want to

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:58,879
address

113
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,879
development right so first i want to

114
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
start out i like having an interactive

115
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,439
kind of talk

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,400
how many of you in an infosec role

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,879
interact

118
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
routinely with development teams how

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,400
many of you

120
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,040
all right i would say that's roughly

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,798
maybe 15ish percent

122
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,040
maybe close to 20 how many of you that

123
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,918
had your hands up

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,918
how many of you actually interact with

125
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,440
them in a way where you send them

126
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,479
something or you

127
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,040
you provide them data out of some set of

128
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,400
vulnerabilities or something how many of

129
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
you do that

130
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
all right now how many of you with your

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
hands up keep your hands up how many of

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
you actually have

133
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
have interacted with the tools they use

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
like git and their source code

135
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,479
management tools

136
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,240
and some of the other tools they use

137
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
okay cool we got some hands up the

138
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,160
problem is we don't do that

139
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
as an industry right we like to tell

140
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,680
developers that

141
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
you're writing insecure code but as just

142
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,280
pointed out today

143
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,638
we don't do a whole lot more than that

144
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,240
and with solarwinds there's a lot of

145
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,160
hype right now about supply chain

146
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,720
attacks

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
right this is a big thing and software

148
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
supply chain

149
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
is a real issue but a lot of companies

150
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,160
are using it as fud

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,919
based marketing fear uncertainty and

152
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
doubt a lot of people are doing that

153
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
and unfortunately because we see that as

154
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
like a hypey thing we're not really

155
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
taking the time

156
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
to spend and look at it and another term

157
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
that people use a lot is devsecops

158
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,479
right they talk about deficit cops

159
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,639
deficit cops it's like devops

160
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,759
with sec right

161
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,280
what what does that mean what the freak

162
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
does that mean like you're adding sect i

163
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,000
mean

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,039
to me dev suck ups like my background in

165
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,840
devops

166
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,840
right it changed my career right i was

167
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
an ops guy i came from a unix background

168
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,000
had been working with a lot of

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,960
developers

170
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,039
but what we did 10 years ago or 12 years

171
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,240
ago whenever that happened

172
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
whenever we crossed that line in the

173
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
devops territory is

174
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,639
developers in ops came towards the

175
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,680
center

176
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,639
we changed our behavior right now the

177
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,320
problem with devsecops is

178
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
security more or less hasn't really done

179
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,680
that right

180
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,639
honestly have we have we tried to enter

181
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,479
into the developers workspace

182
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,039
and help them i think typically the way

183
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,560
infosec interacts with them

184
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,360
is we send them a list of

185
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,680
vulnerabilities fix your and that's

186
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,400
not going to work

187
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,840
right um recently

188
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
we were talking to a large bank here in

189
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
australia and

190
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,479
they're like yeah we're doing depths of

191
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,160
cops right yeah

192
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,960
gotta go on it we're shifting left and

193
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
so we started talking to them

194
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
we asked them all right so what things

195
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,479
what things do you give responsibility

196
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:28,800
for

197
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
from a security perspective what things

198
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,319
do you give to developers

199
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,319
like oh yeah you know they can they can

200
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,319
do some sass they can use sneak

201
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
okay cool sweet right on so after that

202
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
what what else do they do oh well you

203
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,560
know

204
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
we asked them so i mean if you do das

205
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,759
and some of these other things sca where

206
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,880
do you do that oh no no they don't do

207
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,600
that

208
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,120
you know we do that once you deploy into

209
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,880
an environment right we do it there

210
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
okay i mean what controls does that

211
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
developer have access to the web server

212
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
can they change things in their

213
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,280
application in terms of

214
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,800
security headers and other functions no

215
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,919
no that's something that we do at the

216
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,400
edge

217
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
right and what they were saying was we

218
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,000
want to shift left

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,160
but we're giving the developers nothing

220
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
to shift left

221
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
right we're not giving them anything so

222
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
it's just a it's just a phrase that we

223
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,400
use

224
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
uh and like a lot of things in in the

225
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,520
security world

226
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
unfortunately the um the phrases

227
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,960
uh are what we hear about you go to rsa

228
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
and uh the

229
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
developer experience and yeah what does

230
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,240
that mean uh

231
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759
and those people that are actually are

232
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
doing a little bit of devsecops

233
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
they do something that i call the spit

234
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
roast the devsecops spit roast

235
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
a little bit of sass on the developer

236
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
workstation a little bit of sneak maybe

237
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,840
for example

238
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
we had some sneak people in the audience

239
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,639
earlier or somebody was wearing the

240
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,199
shirts

241
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,360
a little bit of sneak and a pen test

242
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,280
once a year and that's the spit roast

243
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
right that's all they do it just sits

244
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,560
there right

245
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,400
that is not devsecops that's a spit

246
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,719
roast

247
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,599
i'm good there you go we're warming up

248
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,199
we're warming up

249
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,400
let me make sure i didn't miss any of my

250
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
other jokes here um

251
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,319
all right so looking at solarwinds in

252
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,319
particular

253
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,840
we understand as a community that this

254
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,360
was a very sophisticated event

255
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
right we understand that

256
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
the russian svr and other organizations

257
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,840
are spending a lot of time

258
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
looking at the behaviors of say

259
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,440
developers

260
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,879
to get access to tools right but

261
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,520
how much are we doing as a group to

262
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,000
actually

263
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,039
address that the sbr knows that's a weak

264
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,759
spot

265
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,759
we kind of know that's a weak spot what

266
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,759
are we doing about it

267
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,919
some people use this hyperbole about a

268
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
cyber war right

269
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,320
well if it's a cyber war we're losing

270
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
right and we're not going to we're not

271
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
going to offensively work our way out of

272
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,839
this what are we going to

273
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,959
do kill every svr hacker there is right

274
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,279
we can't do that this is something that

275
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,000
has to happen

276
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,880
on the other side on the blue side and

277
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
really for a developer and for an

278
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,519
application that means actually

279
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,120
getting involved in the process so um

280
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
why do we have this problem and this is

281
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,560
the part that

282
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
infosec is not going to love right which

283
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
is

284
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,279
sorry my turntables here

285
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,480
so security

286
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,200
sorry because software is running the

287
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
world someone famous once said that

288
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
software is eating the world

289
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
um it's driving the economy right and

290
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
unfortunately for us as the infosec

291
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,920
community the developers building stuff

292
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,320
for

293
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,959
the business are making money for the

294
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,680
business

295
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
right infosec we don't really make money

296
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,440
for the business right

297
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
so it's no wonder the developer isn't in

298
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
that side of the business

299
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
gets all the budget right and we don't

300
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
and that's a problem

301
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,080
public cloud has made this that much

302
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,120
worse

303
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,600
because the accessibility of it is so

304
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,399
close

305
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
to the developer they don't have to go

306
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,839
through any of those checkpoints they

307
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,040
used to go through right

308
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
they don't have to go through an ops

309
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
team or an infosec team they can just go

310
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,880
spin up things

311
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,720
in aws in my experience the use of azure

312
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
microsoft azure in our applications

313
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,800
typically happens it comes in as a

314
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
second public cloud

315
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,839
because somebody just went and consumed

316
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
something there whether that was

317
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
adfs or something else they consumed

318
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
something and all of a sudden

319
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
you used to be an aws shop and now

320
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,000
you're multi-cloud because they just

321
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
went out and got it right

322
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,160
and that's not cool so software is

323
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,279
eating the world

324
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,079
and what are we gonna do about it here's

325
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,640
my here's my third meme for the day

326
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
this is a shout out to patrick but um

327
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,320
my purpose of my talk today is not to

328
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
find out how the solar winds attack

329
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
happened

330
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,560
i'm not going to worry about the

331
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
multi-stage malware i'm not going to

332
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
worry about the azure stuff

333
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
what i'm going to talk about today is

334
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
ways that we as an infosec group

335
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
as a security industry can help make

336
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,399
better applications how we can help

337
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,399
developers make better applications

338
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,800
um

339
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
that's good enough there all right let's

340
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,199
jump right in

341
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,160
all right so we're gonna go over a few

342
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
glossary things today i just wanted to

343
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
kind of get the nomenclature

344
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,800
right all right so the first thing is we

345
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,560
want to talk about today is a

346
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,920
repository or a repo whoa

347
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,320
do i really only have 10 minutes all

348
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,200
right man

349
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
um is a repository a repo what is a repo

350
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,240
right

351
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
it is the unit of storage for a software

352
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,279
developer that's where they write

353
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,000
something that's where they

354
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
save it scm source code management

355
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,519
this is the uh versioning and the

356
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,040
standard operating model that sits

357
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
around repositories in this

358
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,519
in the storage of that code sprint we've

359
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,320
all heard about these

360
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,560
magical sprints right what the hell is a

361
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,440
sprint

362
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
right a sprint is a short period of time

363
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,200
where developers build

364
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,760
a set of features usually features and

365
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
they usually do that within

366
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,920
an agile framework now i want to take an

367
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,680
opportunity to talk about agile

368
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,519
so agile really to the

369
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,959
like devops to the business really meant

370
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,040
we get what we want faster right

371
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,839
that's what it means right it means we

372
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,360
get what we want faster

373
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,880
we can go directly to them we can say

374
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
hey reprioritize

375
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
and do this now because the business

376
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
wants it and that was part of the the

377
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
real part of agile which was that

378
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,880
you want to be agile you want to be have

379
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,160
agility if somebody comes in and says

380
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
hey we're going to change focus a little

381
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
bit software teams need to be able to

382
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,200
to deal with that but i want to i want

383
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
to emphasize

384
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,920
the behavior and we'll talk about this

385
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,279
in a second the behavior of management

386
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,880
is to hear that and say

387
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,839
that means i get what i want faster

388
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,880
oh with two turntables

389
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,440
all right supply chain attack i think we

390
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,639
all kind of get this

391
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,560
basically it's it's not coming directly

392
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,079
at the target right instead you're going

393
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
to a dependency of that target

394
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
the way i like to talk about this is if

395
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,040
you wanted to attack australia

396
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,839
one way to do it let's say the vaccine

397
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,639
right

398
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,320
you put something bad in the vaccine and

399
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,079
then guess what our distribution of that

400
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,040
vaccine

401
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
does the rest the work for you this is

402
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
why this is what makes supply chain

403
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,399
attacks so powerful is that they don't

404
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,360
have to do that much

405
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
they get in that first part and then we

406
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,240
our processes do it for them

407
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
devops devops is really practices in

408
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,279
automation

409
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,959
that work to bring developers and

410
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
operations closer together

411
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,959
i feel like i'm doing like a t-rex arms

412
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,279
up here

413
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,680
and devsecops is supposed to be bringing

414
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,040
the security teams into that as i talked

415
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,240
about earlier that really hasn't

416
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,959
happened

417
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,079
and finally get get is is the

418
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,200
product that most developers use to to

419
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,959
interact with their code bases we all

420
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,399
good we got the glossary

421
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,720
all right

422
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,279
all right so what i've done is i've come

423
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,040
up with this this concept i'm not going

424
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
to call it a framework because we have

425
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,279
way too many frameworks

426
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,639
i call the supply chain vbp value

427
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,000
behaviors and patterns and

428
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
in the interest of time and won't spend

429
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,160
too much time

430
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,040
describing it but basically a value is

431
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,440
how

432
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,880
are companies targeted for

433
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,279
an attack right if the bad guys were to

434
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,120
target a software development team

435
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
how would they do that how do i decide

436
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,240
who to target

437
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,079
who's a high value target right so this

438
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,360
is basically you can think of this as

439
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
threat modeling

440
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,680
but different companies have different

441
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
values

442
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
who's the target customer of that

443
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,760
company where have they built their

444
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,959
infrastructure this is a lot more

445
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,000
important than people think it is

446
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,800
because

447
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,519
if you want to say get access to a

448
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,480
customer via

449
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
like their multi-tenant or single tenant

450
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,199
application they built in aws

451
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,320
that's something that you can target

452
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
specifically what does their application

453
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,880
do

454
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
does it deliver something is it trusted

455
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,959
a human

456
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,720
what role in the company is being

457
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
targeted and finally the

458
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,519
location physical industrial or

459
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,519
geopolitical

460
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,560
all right now this is where it starts to

461
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
get good

462
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,839
did it go too far well i went too far

463
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,519
all right so what are some of the

464
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
behaviors that we can look for

465
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,920
for developers it's things like

466
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,959
the fact that 70 of devs build resources

467
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,160
in the clouds

468
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,680
in the cloud themselves this is one

469
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,199
piece of data that's not actually out of

470
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,959
our secure stack data set

471
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,399
so this means they can just go and build

472
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,560
things themselves why developers like

473
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,040
saml

474
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,279
and sso so much because it it's just

475
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
simple for them they just give access to

476
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,199
it

477
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,880
and we see how well that's doing with

478
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,959
with azure apps right

479
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,360
um they use the business as an excuse to

480
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,880
do what they want

481
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,639
um they don't refresh credentials

482
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,399
because it breaks their automation

483
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,519
and this goes back to something that i

484
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,040
think just mentioned earlier today

485
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,639
there's a reason developers don't want

486
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,839
to refresh their credentials it's

487
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,279
because they've got a bunch of different

488
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,720
things built in different places all

489
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,600
doing stuff

490
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
and if they change their credentials and

491
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,199
i'm not making an excuse for that but

492
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,160
that's why they don't want to do it

493
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
right

494
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,199
service accounts and whatnot they use

495
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,440
one account for multiple stages right

496
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,800
they don't have i've seen it again and

497
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
again again they don't have separate

498
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,279
accounts for the different

499
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,880
environments they have one account well

500
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
guess what if you get access to one

501
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,519
get access to all them and they don't

502
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,320
return

503
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,079
to address technical debt and that's

504
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,599
mostly because of management

505
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,360
let me jump to management management

506
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,600
emphasizes starting and not finishing

507
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,959
management usually doesn't care about

508
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,800
agile as i pointed out

509
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,399
because it means give me what they want

510
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,920
fast right

511
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,160
the constant emphasis for management on

512
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,279
features

513
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,279
ends up under indexing security and

514
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,040
availability and other things

515
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,680
managers don't like don't expect the

516
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
developers to

517
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,920
interact with security tools so guess

518
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,000
what they don't

519
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,279
and they under represent management

520
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,880
under represents complexity to the

521
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
c-suite and this is huge this is why we

522
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,680
don't get budgets

523
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,959
right it's because management under the

524
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,039
middle management under represents the

525
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,359
value of these things

526
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,959
let's look at some behaviors of leads

527
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,160
and this will get important here in a

528
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
second

529
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,679
leads are the people that oversee a

530
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,079
small group of developers a pod

531
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
they often act as gateways for pull

532
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,079
requests and decision making

533
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,079
they enforce standards for methodologies

534
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,959
sorry i gotta go over here

535
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,080
they enforce standards and methodologies

536
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,039
but then they also

537
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,000
abuse their own privileges it's super

538
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
super common

539
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,360
so imagine in a world

540
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,400
in the i.t industry right we everybody

541
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
says that security is important but

542
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,720
really

543
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
we're only emphasizing the features and

544
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,559
the speed

545
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,400
that's our metric of success right

546
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
imagine

547
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,480
if we held bus drivers to the same

548
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,360
metric of success

549
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
we said hey the most important thing is

550
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,240
to get from point a to point b as

551
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,400
quickly as possible

552
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
it's not going to work but that's

553
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,840
exactly what we do with our development

554
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,799
teams

555
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,840
it's exactly what we do

556
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
all right some patterns and i'm gonna

557
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
start zipping through these patterns are

558
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,039
requests

559
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,880
are repeated traits by an organization

560
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,080
that makes the org less

561
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,960
secure right pretty straightforward it's

562
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
separate from behavior behavior as a

563
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
human being a pattern is evidenced by an

564
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,520
org so the

565
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,840
org

566
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,880
uh patterns some of these patterns will

567
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,200
they will always use the same names for

568
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
all of their environments

569
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
dev test staging uat prod makes it

570
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,000
really easy to guess right

571
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
you look at it and see what it does at

572
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
least 70 75

573
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,720
of lower environments are treated

574
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
differently in the prod they spend time

575
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,440
securing prod

576
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,039
but they don't spend time securing the

577
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,280
lower environments they use the name of

578
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,559
the application

579
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,240
in the dns public name jira vault

580
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
come on guys you're just like

581
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,880
advertising to bad guys what the hell it

582
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,600
does right

583
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,960
it's like back in the 90s when we named

584
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,880
things zeus and apollo

585
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,000
at least you couldn't figure out what it

586
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,799
was right and lastly they

587
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,760
they use cloudflare um they use it for

588
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
pride but they don't use it for anything

589
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,760
else

590
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,799
super super common

591
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,600
all right so here what we're looking at

592
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,440
here is we're basically looking at

593
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,280
a series of apis that are treated

594
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,960
differently um

595
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
and this is super common we emphasize

596
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,799
uh security and availability for prod

597
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,840
but we don't do it for the lower

598
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,120
environment so guess where the hackers

599
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
go they go and learn your application in

600
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,840
lower environments

601
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,919
they find out how it works how the apis

602
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,600
work and then they take that to pride

603
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,640
because you weren't

604
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,799
watching dev nobody was watching dev

605
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,240
there's no logs for it nobody's looking

606
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,480
at it

607
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
all right so here's some patterns in scm

608
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
source code management

609
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,799
um what we're looking at here is

610
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,000
the github is often used for your public

611
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,039
repos

612
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,480
and something else is used for your

613
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
private repos because bitbucket and some

614
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,039
other things are free

615
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,280
github isn't so that pattern happens a

616
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,159
lot and you can look

617
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,840
you can look for that

618
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,960
different scm tools are used uh and not

619
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,080
necessarily mapped

620
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,679
so if they're using those different scm

621
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,440
tools they're not necessarily mapped

622
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,039
to the underlying environments in a

623
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,039
one-for-one scenario so that means that

624
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,559
they might be using different scm tools

625
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,320
but then they fork into one and you can

626
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
see that

627
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,240
um all right so

628
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,480
try to wrap it up in what five minutes

629
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,760
all right cool five minutes

630
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,440
all right so we're gonna jump ahead so

631
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,720
there's several other patterns here i've

632
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,520
identified

633
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,720
but let's put this vbp uh framework

634
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,679
i use framework into action for

635
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,799
solarwinds

636
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,720
our friends of solarwinds here's their

637
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
famous customer page

638
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,840
it's now been taken down but it

639
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,280
basically advertised the 300

640
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,360
000 organizations that used solarwinds

641
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,960
right thanks guys

642
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,120
you just gave me everybody to attack um

643
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,200
and this is gonna be a reoccurring theme

644
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,679
here what we're looking at here now is

645
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,520
if i was a bad guy and i was using the

646
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
vbp system right

647
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
let's just imagine i'm a russian svr the

648
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,480
first thing i'm gonna do like every

649
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,360
ocean warrior

650
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
is go to linkedin right i'm gonna search

651
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,799
for solarwinds i'm gonna find all the

652
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,600
people that are

653
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,840
software developers and have orion in

654
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,720
their title

655
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,080
and then i'm gonna filter for senior

656
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,240
team lead things like that and that

657
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,840
gives me a list of i don't know a couple

658
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,960
hundred people

659
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,679
and that's when i find this guy we're

660
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,840
gonna call him

661
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,159
elvis right elvis is like a lot of

662
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,760
developers he's a team lead he's been at

663
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,600
solarwinds for a long long time

664
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,640
right over 20 years he has access to

665
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,320
public and private repos

666
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
and he's a net guy and because he's been

667
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
in the industry a long time he has

668
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,280
built-in behaviors that we can use

669
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,520
against him for example one of the

670
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
things he does

671
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,200
is he uses his

672
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,720
his solarwinds email address as his scm

673
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,280
login

674
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,520
guess what 95 of organizations do this

675
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
they use your work email so if i know

676
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,000
your work email

677
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,360
i know half of your credentials now for

678
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,960
your scm tool and more than that

679
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,520
the vast majority of developers don't

680
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,159
use

681
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,960
mfa or ssh to do their interactions with

682
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,240
that source code management

683
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,080
which really sucks so what we're looking

684
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,440
at here is we're looking at a bunch of

685
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,320
open

686
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,039
public repos right so this is cool

687
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,480
solarwinds has got a bunch of

688
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
of public repos and github their

689
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,840
microsoft shop

690
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,880
what we're looking for is we're looking

691
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,760
for elvis we want to see hey elvis

692
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,200
he's he's oops he was making

693
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,600
significant changes to the chocolaty

694
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,799
package manager

695
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,520
for solarwinds in a time frame during

696
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,000
the

697
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,360
the hack interesting he also made 151

698
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
contributions during this one period

699
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,520
to private repos private repos

700
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,360
what we're seeing here is we're looking

701
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,720
at the fact that

702
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,039
he is actually making comments sorry

703
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,720
commits to the source code

704
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,760
during the time period that we're

705
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,919
looking for and this is the best

706
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,360
now i know this is going to be there's a

707
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,120
lot of text what we're looking at here

708
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,919
is that

709
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,080
he merged one commit into master

710
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,480
he self-assigned and wrote that piece of

711
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,280
code

712
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,120
himself oops

713
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,240
and he merged that commit himself

714
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
so what he did is he wrote a piece of

715
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,679
code and i'm picking elvis but he's like

716
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,440
most of the developers that we look at

717
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,960
he wrote a piece of code he

718
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,799
self-assigned that to himself in the sem

719
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:33,200
tool

720
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,280
in jira and then he merged it in the

721
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,799
master itself and guess what then it

722
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,080
went into chocolaty

723
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
and then we all kind of know what

724
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
happened next right

725
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,320
if i dive a little bit more into elvis

726
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,799
oh

727
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,159
oh wait he's he's actually checking in

728
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,919
the the the production build server

729
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,600
into a git file in a public repo

730
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,640
right thanks guys i now know

731
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,760
your public build server sweet ass

732
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,000
and that my friends ends today's

733
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,559
presentation

734
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,070
round of applause

735
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,250
[Applause]

736
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,339
[Music]

737
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,520
yeah yeah we are a little bit over time

738
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,880
but if anyone wants to squeeze in a

739
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,919
question i feel like we should

740
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,360
yep where's these coming right there um

741
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,559
one of the like main sort of

742
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,080
scary areas seems to be more like

743
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,919
transit of dependencies so

744
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,000
you know there's a massive graph of

745
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,520
various things making their ways into

746
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,200
products so even if your security is

747
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,080
fantastic

748
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,440
you could be doing everything with nics

749
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,279
and it's all hermetic and beautiful

750
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,400
if you have upstream things no go

751
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,919
are there any good patterns for working

752
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,159
around that or ways to put in

753
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,159
like you know processes because it's a

754
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,200
human problem because

755
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,559
you have the crypto there to go great

756
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,679
that change but you need someone to

757
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:52,720
actually verify

758
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,400
what all of those upstream items are and

759
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,000
that's just not something which is

760
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,120
easily doable

761
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,360
no totally get it man and my developers

762
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,640
actually we have this issue ourselves

763
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:00,960
right

764
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
it's the npm show that's what it is

765
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,200
right you can anybody can check in

766
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
anybody can make a single change to that

767
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
code base and pull in some new stuff via

768
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,480
npm and we all

769
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
i think we all know the history of npm

770
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,840
right it's not a good one

771
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,679
yeah it's a huge issue but the reality

772
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,200
is that emphasizing sca

773
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,919
and dependency scanning tools both at

774
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,520
the at the developers laptop

775
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,600
right as well as part of the build

776
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,039
process right whether you're doing that

777
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:25,440
in

778
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,039
bitbucket pipelines or github actions

779
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,880
doing it in in more than one place right

780
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
because what i see is i see people do

781
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,279
one place

782
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,919
and then i get skipped so yes you're

783
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,960
right it's a huge issue

784
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,880
we're trying to address it though

785
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,960
anybody else

786
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,600
yeah so paul's hanging around did say

787
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,080
outside

788
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,600
somewhere around there i'm gonna go get

789
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
a tasty beverage yeah so so if you see

790
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,360
paul and you've got questions go go find

791
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,240
him and ask

792
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,440
one more round of applause for paul

793
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,840
please thanks

794
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,158
