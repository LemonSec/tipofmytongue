00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,959
on that and did a great job so

61
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,480
well done um i decided because

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
why not let's make things even harder i

63
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,959
ran a red versus blue ctf this year

64
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
where we had four teams of well

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
played players and stuff who just like

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,519
were attacking and defending each other

67
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
all day long and stuff

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,640

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,599
