1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,360
hello

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,400
everybody um my name is alice butler and

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,039
i am the manager of enterprise platform

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,960
services for the department of education

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,480
in queensland

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,400
um i have been

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,160
many hats over many years in the

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,760
department

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,039
and i've also worked in private

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,439
enterprise for large data centers

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,440
and service providers in queensland

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,680
i've done sys admin a.d security

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,040
a bit of everything so

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,879
when they kind of threw the cloud at me

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,079
it was you know the next big challenge

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
so i'm just going to walk through a

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,520
little bit of

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,320
um i've been on a basically a two-year

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,120
journey

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,480
of securing my enterprise cloud

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
and i've made a lot of mistakes and i've

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,320
learned a lot

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
and i thought maybe i could help some of

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,799
you from making the same mistakes that i

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,360
did

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,720
so take what you need

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,940
borrow it steal it i don't care

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,400
[Laughter]

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
and we'll get going so why are we still

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,880
talking about this in 2021

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,600
so really what happened to us i'll tell

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,040
you a little bit

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
we had a huge blowout in cloud costs

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
we had a lot of application teams

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
running and putting stuff in the cloud

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,000
without

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
needing infrastructure teams anymore

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,360
and we had a couple of security

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,280
incidents so we had uh

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
a crypto vm which was a lot of fun and

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,600
they're like uh

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,159
can't you just restore it from a backup

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,840
that doesn't exist

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
um so yeah we had that happen and then

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,000
we had a

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,399
pen test that went horribly wrong and

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,479
nobody knew how to get the logs out

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,680
so this really highlighted the maturity

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,439
of our cloud services within the

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
department and i was

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,038
assigned to go on this journey to

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,319
mature our cloud services and uh

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,720
yeah put some security and stuff in at

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,319
the same time

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,599
so cloud generally uh is not trusted by

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,080
large

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
enterprises still and that's because

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,239
it's fear-based right they don't

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,519
understand

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,440
that the cloud is really just setting up

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
a new data center from scratch

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,879
it's still seen as risky for this reason

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
and it changes constantly

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
people are really not good at keeping up

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,519
with the change

66
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,000
cadence that's happening in the cloud

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
and

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
keeping that in mind and then adjusting

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
their application and their security

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,160
for those changes cloud's also seen as a

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
way around traditional governance

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
so that thing i was talking about where

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
you don't need infrastructure teams

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,000
anymore

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,599
you can just bung any old thing in the

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,080
cloud it works

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
but it's not secure

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
so for example

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
uh you have your traditional sort of

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,480
infrastructure on the

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
right there and uh you've got you know

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
all the years worth of infrastructure

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
you've built up

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
for your security and depth your

85
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,840
firewalls your

86
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,239
ips ids your im your

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,120
ssl certificate pki infrastructure all

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,239
of that good stuff that you've built up

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,840
so you can put an app in there like a

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
domain controller or a similar

91
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
and no by default all that stuff's there

92
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
but if you have a look on the left if i

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
go and build that same domain controller

94
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
in the cloud

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,000
i get a server a nic

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
an ip address a network security group

97
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,680
and a virtual network so a subnet

98
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
yeah that's what you get so you can't

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
assume that all this stuff comes with it

100
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
and that's why it's kind of risky to

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,439
just go and jam any old stuff in the

102
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,959
cloud without actually going through and

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,799
building it like it's an entirely new

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,840
data center

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
so you've been given the job of uh

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,519
securing the cloud for your organization

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,759
uh where do you go where do you start i

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
mean it's such a huge beast where where

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
do you even begin

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,320
start number one get access to the cloud

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,080
if you don't already have access to your

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,759
organization's cloud

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,400
get access

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
and don't change anything yet

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,840
this is important you don't want to lose

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
the trust of all your customers

117
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,080
first up so get access don't change

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
anything

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
get an inventory of everything that's

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
already there

121
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
all the security that might be in there

122
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,639
or might not be in there in this case

123
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
um and have a look for any sort of

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,160
glaring issues in security monitoring if

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
it's enabled

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
most of these cloud platforms have like

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,039
a

128
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,840
secure score or a gamified score for

129
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
your security

130
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,199
stance in the platform have a look at

131
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,880
that and get a good baseline of what's

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,600
there and what's missing

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,840
then get your big boss on board and get

134
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,039
him to get them

135
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,039
to communicate what your goal is

136
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
what they've tasked you with to the

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,320
organization

138
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
this is really important because you

139
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
need to have that

140
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
endorsement so that your customers

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,240
really know

142
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
that you've been given this goal and

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,320
they need to support you in this goal

144
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
from there you need to engage your

145
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
customers now your customers in this

146
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,080
sense

147
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,639
even if it's internal are people that

148
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,960
consume cloud whether it's devops

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,120
devs sec ops whatever the flavor is

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,680
talk to these guys and girls and find

151
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,720
out

152
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,360
what their bug bears are and tell them

153
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,720
about what you're doing

154
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,720
and how it's going to affect them and

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
yeah get them used to you being around

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,080
and being the point of contact for all

157
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
this sort of stuff

158
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
then you want to engage your cloud

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
provider for support or guidance

160
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
so this is really just touching base

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
with them and finding out

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,280
um who their contact points are and

163
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,560
letting them know what you've been

164
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,600
charged with

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,120
from a gov from a organizational stance

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,720
and yeah say like i'm the new owner of

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
cloud for my organization so

168
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,919
anything cloud come to me they might be

169
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
able to offer some resources some

170
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,039
training all that sort of stuff so

171
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,280
that's always handy

172
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
then on to phase two is really the uh

173
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,120
cis

174
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,080
stuff so this is where your regulatory

175
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,639
and

176
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,560
legislative requirements stuff comes in

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,680
really handy

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
uh check for any of those sort of

179
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,919
requirements including stuff like

180
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,440
um your data sovereignty

181
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,560
laws that you might need to um be

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
engaged with uh be compliant with

183
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
and then um yeah keep those in mind when

184
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,560
you're planning

185
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
for all the work that you're doing in

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,639
the cloud

187
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
your next step is really to look at best

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
practice so

189
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
all these cloud providers really do have

190
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,720
a lot of

191
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,919
documentation available for best

192
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,680
practice in the cloud

193
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
this is really awesome because it means

194
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
you don't have to go and recreate the

195
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:35,680
wheel

196
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
just use best practice it's there

197
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,319
we've always done it this way on prem is

198
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,440
also

199
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,520
the good old theme of the day by the

200
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,440
sounds of it i've heard jess talk about

201
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,360
it earlier

202
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
it doesn't have to apply to cloud you

203
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
can

204
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,039
when you design cloud components design

205
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,720
them with the cloud in mind

206
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,479
you don't have to repeat old patterns

207
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,000
because we've always done it this way

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
for the last 25 years or whatever the

209
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,879
case may be

210
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,280
i fell for this one quite early on so

211
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
we put in a naming standard for the

212
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,879
cloud in

213
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,919
um a very early stages of our journey

214
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,319
and uh we went oh we've got to name it

215
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,160
like this and then this and this and

216
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,919
this and this and this because

217
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
that's how we do it on premise that's

218
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
how we identify a resource

219
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
but it didn't really make sense because

220
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,720
the cloud has things like tags and all

221
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,160
those sorts of good stuff

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
where you can actually organize your

223
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
resources in a really um

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
well thought out way and it makes it so

225
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,599
much easier to find stuff

226
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,839
so you don't have to name it like this

227
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,919
server with this function with this

228
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,399
number

229
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,519
in this data center so you don't have to

230
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,200
repeat those old patterns at all

231
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,399
um plan out your immediate priorities is

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,600
the next step so

233
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
go through and look at uh how you would

234
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
apply tagging

235
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
set up privileged accounts your cloud

236
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,519
sort of structure

237
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,040
so that's like accounts and

238
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
organizations in aws

239
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
or tenants and subscriptions and

240
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,279
resource groups if you're looking at

241
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
azure and then look at

242
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
how you're going to set up your id and

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
access management

244
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,519
components so that's really around are

245
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,839
you going to stretch your existing

246
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,160
identity platform from on-prem into the

247
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,720
cloud or you're creating something from

248
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
from scratch also consider your network

249
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,000
design so

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
same thing are you going to extend your

251
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
existing network into the cloud

252
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
or are you going to create a separate

253
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,519
network segment for the cloud and keep

254
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,480
it isolated

255
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,440
next is really getting your customers on

256
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,160
board

257
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,959
and communicating your plans so this is

258
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,600
constant

259
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
customer contact keep them informed

260
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,680
every step of the way

261
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,200
if you hold their hand through the

262
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
change journey it makes your life so

263
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
much easier

264
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,000
if you just change stuff on them

265
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
overnight they get really

266
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,040
upset and defensive and they'll probably

267
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,160
won't support you

268
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,760
so all change as they call it

269
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,600
so holding a customer's hand through the

270
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,120
whole journey is

271
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,040
probably the most important part of this

272
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,519
entire

273
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,160
exercise and then remember just enough

274
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,920
security

275
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,519
so you don't want to put so much

276
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,839
security in straight off the bat

277
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,839
that your customers now can't do their

278
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,000
job the way they've always done it

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
you need to consider that they might not

280
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,079
be ready for

281
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,200
you know five types of multi-factor and

282
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
all this sort of stuff right you need to

283
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,360
think

284
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
what is the band minimum bare minimum

285
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
security that we need

286
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,680
that will satisfy our requirements that

287
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
won't impact the way that they

288
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,399
currently do their job

289
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,320
from there we move on to phase three so

290
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
phase three is really the tactical get

291
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,680
stuff done phase

292
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
so phase three is about consolidating

293
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
all your accounts

294
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,279
so this is really important because you

295
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,560
want to

296
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,240
by consolidating your accounts you have

297
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,920
everything in one place

298
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,200
so that's one place to apply governance

299
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,320
one place to apply security controls one

300
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,560
place to manage and find resources if

301
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,518
something goes wrong

302
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,160
next step is around tagging now tagging

303
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,600
is not

304
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,720
typically a security control but

305
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,480
this is why it's super important for

306
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,160
security

307
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,640
consider you're in a security operations

308
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,440
center

309
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,279
and you get an alert that says resource

310
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,839
abcdefg12345 in the cloud has been

311
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,040
attacked how do you know what that is

312
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
how do you know if it's important you

313
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
don't have any idea unless you have some

314
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,000
sort of

315
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
clarifying information to let you know

316
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
so this is where tags can be used to

317
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
really help you

318
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,399
and your security ops teams in

319
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,279
identifying

320
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,079
um important resources to protect when

321
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,720
you're looking at cloud security

322
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
so you can have things like the type of

323
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
data that's stored in the application

324
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
the criticality of the application the

325
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,000
zone that's in if it's a

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,480
test or a dev zone or a prodzone all

327
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,839
that sort of information

328
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,680
put together can really give you an idea

329
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,279
of the risk profile that you're looking

330
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,160
at

331
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,959
when you do get a security alert

332
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,639
the next step is really around cleanup

333
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,920
so it's a bit boring but it's important

334
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,639
clean up all your old stuff get rid of

335
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,880
it it's probably costing you money

336
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,160
and it's probably uh maybe even an old

337
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,240
type of resource that might be uh

338
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,959
vulnerable or unsupported so get rid of

339
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,560
it or get your customers to get rid of

340
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
it give them a reasonable

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
reasonable time frame but yeah get rid

342
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,480
of it it's not worth it

343
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,360
identity as a security boundary so this

344
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,680
is

345
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,880
probably the big part of cloud so

346
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,519
identity is you know the new security

347
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,240
boundary

348
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,839
for cloud so you need to make sure that

349
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,959
your identity is

350
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,040
as strong as possible because everything

351
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,800
relies on your identity

352
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,680
implement privileged identity management

353
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
multi-factor authentication role-based

354
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,120
access controls

355
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,240
and identity conditions reduce your god

356
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
level admins

357
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
down as few as possible identity

358
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,320
conditions are things like using a

359
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,519
policy

360
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
or a conditional access policy to

361
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,959
prevent

362
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,000
impossible travel or enforce

363
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
mfa if someone's logging on from an

364
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
untrusted location

365
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,440
all those sorts of things lay it up will

366
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,240
really help you

367
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,399
next you want to integrate with your

368
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
seams or

369
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
um so by doing that you give your

370
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,839
security team

371
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
one place to look and they don't have to

372
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
go and train and yet another platform

373
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
that is a monitoring platform they just

374
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
have their known

375
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,639
good monitoring system that they've

376
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,720
always used that they can look at and

377
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,279
rely on

378
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,880
then you really need to go through and

379
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,720
enforce onboarding of security

380
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,079
monitoring agents

381
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
for behavior and vulnerability

382
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
you can enforce this by default so it's

383
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
kind of good because it means anything

384
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
new that comes on will automatically get

385
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,079
these monitoring agents

386
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,160
and then you can push it out to any

387
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
existing resources as well so you know

388
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,800
everything's covered

389
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,040
uh you can also use policies to enforce

390
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,639
encryption at rest

391
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
um which i don't think i need to say

392
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,560
much more about you just want to protect

393
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
your data that's at rest

394
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
so that if you do get breached at least

395
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,000
you know that that stuff is secured

396
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,760
and network security teams need to be

397
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,240
prepped and get them used to looking at

398
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,720
all the various functions

399
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
that network plays in the cloud there's

400
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,000
multiple ways

401
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,959
to configure network stuff so get them

402
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
used to having a look at that and get

403
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,120
them

404
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
familiarized and to get them to start

405
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,839
planning out all the components

406
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
create two offline break glass accounts

407
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,360
so

408
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,199
as jess was talking about earlier two is

409
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
a minimum so you can create more if you

410
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,600
want but

411
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,560
at least two i recommend keeping them in

412
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,680
a safe offline

413
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,639
don't use them ever unless you need to

414
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,399
so on to phase four phase four is really

415
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
kind of a retrospective so

416
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
you need to go back and look at

417
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,279
everything that you've done up till this

418
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,399
point

419
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,720
and configure monitoring and alerting

420
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,759
for your health and availability stuff

421
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,519
configure your backups and make sure

422
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,519
that you're only backing up

423
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,440
what you need to back up for a start and

424
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,959
make sure you're only keeping it for as

425
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,160
long as you need to

426
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,279
to feasibly recover from a disaster it's

427
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
not supposed to be a document management

428
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,680
system

429
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
it's supposed to be there to recover

430
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,199
from disasters so

431
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,199
i've seen you know backups being kept

432
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,480
for two years and

433
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,079
feasibly you're not going to really go

434
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,920
back two years in time

435
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,399
for an application and restore that data

436
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,240
so don't keep it longer than you need to

437
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,560
so go through and review and tune all

438
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,839
the work that you've done up to this

439
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,480
point

440
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,240
it's okay to be wrong uh go through and

441
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,199
see like i was talking about the naming

442
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,639
standard that i created and

443
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,320
it wasn't working for us it's okay to go

444
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,160
back and redo those things

445
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,680
we did a tagging policy pretty early on

446
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,959
in the piece and we

447
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,440
enforced it against every resource and

448
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,079
then we found

449
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,240
out that some resources don't actually

450
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
support tags

451
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,959
so we had a lot of problems with

452
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,600
deployments of certain

453
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,519
components of applications that didn't

454
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,720
support tags

455
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,800
and we had to rethink how we did it so

456
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
that's okay it's it's cloud

457
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,400
fail forward um go and redo it

458
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
and figure out a better way of doing it

459
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,760
but it's okay to be wrong

460
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,720
just move forward

461
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
then make a to-do list of all those

462
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,480
little bits that you've seen along the

463
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
way that you haven't had time to do

464
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,760
and get in there and prioritize that

465
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,599
list but don't action it yet

466
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,880
because that's phase five

467
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
phase five you get to fix all these

468
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,160
little bits so

469
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
it's really about focusing on

470
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
fine-tuning all these little bits

471
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,200
and identifying the big strategic

472
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,559
opportunities so

473
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,160
a strategic opportunity in normal person

474
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
speak not government

475
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,280
executive speak is a

476
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,919
piece of work that adds a lot of value

477
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,320
that

478
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,720
takes a bit longer to achieve so what

479
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,520
you want to do

480
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,720
is like think about if you hadn't

481
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,200
already

482
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,600
extended your identity stuff the value

483
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,320
would

484
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,799
it would add by extending identity from

485
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,480
on-premise into the cloud

486
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
or even your network into the cloud if

487
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,760
that's something you wanted to do

488
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
or even connecting your networks between

489
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,280
multiple clouds if that's something you

490
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,080
want to do

491
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,520
they're going to take a bit longer to

492
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,440
nut out and do properly

493
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,120
but it's worth doing if it's worth doing

494
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
then it's something that you want to

495
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,160
identify

496
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,840
in this stage

497
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,760
then you want to really look at

498
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
strengthening your security posture

499
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,160
so this is really around your all your

500
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,919
little bits like vm hardening

501
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,960
patch management hardware hardening

502
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
sorry network hardening so closing off

503
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
any of those open ports that people have

504
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,760
left

505
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,200
open to the internet or whatever

506
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
encryption in transit so that's talking

507
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
to all your customers at dev and devops

508
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,280
teams

509
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,039
making sure they start building

510
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,480
encryption in transit into their

511
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,720
applications

512
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,600
enforce just in time access to app to

513
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
vms and use bastion services where

514
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,480
possible

515
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
uh then you need to start looking at the

516
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
security alerts that you're getting

517
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,960
and really um have a look at the false

518
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
positives that you're getting and the

519
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,960
stuff that

520
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
is coming from apps teams and their poor

521
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,240
behavior

522
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
is an opportunity for you to teach them

523
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
better so

524
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,520
you know remoting in from outside of the

525
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,400
network

526
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
to do work outside of hours rather than

527
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,640
going from a trusted endpoint

528
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,039
and all that sort of stuff so use it to

529
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,760
teach them

530
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,840
a better way of doing it

531
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,240
then it's time for access audits

532
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,840
everybody's favorite time

533
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,040
yes

534
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,280
[Laughter]

535
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,720
so access audits are really important to

536
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,320
do regularly so

537
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,360
have a process to do them regularly

538
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,600
get everybody to define their role-based

539
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
access control requirements so

540
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
what do you need to do your job what

541
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,320
applications do you do it against

542
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,080
what's your business justification for

543
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,679
that um

544
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,720
and how long do you need it for so

545
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,360
those sort of requirements um are

546
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,200
important to gather regularly and

547
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
and check against those regularly so

548
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,159
maybe a six month process or sooner if

549
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,240
you have requirements for that

550
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
within your organization have a process

551
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,520
to go through and audit those

552
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
access controls then go back into your

553
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,760
security

554
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,880
center or your security management tool

555
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,400
sets in your cloud and look at your

556
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
secure score now

557
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
you should be able to measure your

558
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,600
success for all the various

559
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,959
controls that you've now put in

560
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,559
now phase six is all about continuous

561
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,360
improvement

562
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,640
hurry so the cloud is always changing

563
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,960
um this is really important you need to

564
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
constantly monitor the changes for the

565
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,559
cloud

566
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,240
don't assume that something you put in

567
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,720
now is going to be the same in two years

568
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,120
time

569
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,440
five years time you need to monitor it

570
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,480
constantly

571
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,400
and pay attention to those alerts that

572
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,960
come from your provider

573
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,600
so you'll find quite often they'll email

574
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,720
out saying hey

575
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
we're going to change this particular

576
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,640
component to now run

577
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,280
a newer version of this software and you

578
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
need to change

579
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,440
to be in line with that by this date so

580
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,120
make sure that your customers get that

581
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,840
information

582
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,679
because you don't want to end up on a

583
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,880
newspaper article

584
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,120
or you know reddit or something

585
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,039
because your application's gone offline

586
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,880
because you didn't upgrade when you were

587
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,360
supposed to

588
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,240
uh and then really talk to your cloud

589
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,760
providers so if you're an enterprise

590
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,480
customer

591
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
chances are that you probably have an

592
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,679
account manager

593
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,080
or technical account manager that can

594
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
really help you

595
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,840
um organize a training plan

596
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
you're all good um they can help you

597
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,919
organize a training plan

598
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,440
and um from there they can

599
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
possibly even give you a discount or a

600
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
free sort of training program that you

601
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,400
can use to get

602
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
all of your staff at least the most

603
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,320
basic foundational training

604
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,000
and from there you want to make sure

605
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,760
that your security teams and your cloud

606
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,799
teams at least have specialized training

607
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
once you have at least that done you can

608
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
organize a training program to roll out

609
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,520
across everyone that has a hand in cloud

610
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,760
but try and focus on those to start with

611
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,559
this is where you also can start

612
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,320
planning out those bigger strategic

613
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,120
pieces

614
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
they might take a bit longer for you to

615
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
do um

616
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,720
probably years but that's why they're

617
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,400
strategic pieces right

618
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,120
so get a plan in for those and start

619
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,880
getting those rolling as soon as you can

620
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,840
and from there you just start building

621
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,799
those patterns

622
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,320
of regular used components as code

623
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,200
or even how-to guides so this is really

624
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
to

625
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,120
build security in by default at the

626
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,080
beginning

627
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,559
um and it also saves the devs a lot of

628
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,200
pain

629
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,960
so they're more likely to use your code

630
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,559
because let's face it developers are

631
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,840
pretty lazy

632
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
sometimes when it comes to coding where

633
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
they'll just grab something off the

634
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,000
internet

635
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,720
so if you've already got that code built

636
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,799
for them and you know it's trusted

637
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,799
they can build that in by default as

638
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,080
part of a patent and

639
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,919
infrastructure as code they call it

640
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,480
sometimes

641
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,320
[Laughter]

642
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,039
but it makes your life a lot easier and

643
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,240
it means you have a

644
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
good trusted platform to go from

645
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
i have a reference slide here if you

646
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,400
need to take a picture so i'll leave

647
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
that up for a little bit

648
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,039
cloud pooping

649
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,080
all righty just to recap so the goal of

650
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,520
cloud security is

651
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,159
just enough security you need to keep

652
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,320
your customers informed every step of

653
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,880
the way

654
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,679
because that's how you affect good or

655
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,679
change

656
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,840
identity is the most important security

657
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,480
boundary for cloud

658
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
build up your security layers over time

659
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
you don't have to big bang

660
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,559
approach it then use best practice where

661
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,120
possible

662
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,799
there's no need to reinvent the wheel

663
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,279
configure monitoring alerting for health

664
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,919
and availability

665
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,799
make sure you do access audits regularly

666
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,000
and make it part of your standard

667
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
process

668
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,320
then template the common components used

669
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,159
and build code

670
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,840
for those so that you have security by

671
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,200
default

672
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,279
thank you for coming everyone and happy

673
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,510
cloud security

674
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:58,799
[Applause]

675
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,840
anyone got any questions

676
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,360
yep one down the back here hi

677
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
um i'm one of those lazy developers that

678
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,559
you talked about um so

679
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,480
i'm really really interested in like

680
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,720
your view as a security engineer more if

681
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,600
you're

682
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,919
say shifting like what had been legacy

683
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,720
applications

684
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,520
to cloud infrastructure and the options

685
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
that you face between going great

686
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,000
there's

687
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,919
like services here which are provided by

688
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,360
the cloud vendor so if you you know

689
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
whether it's database or like a reddit

690
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
service or anything

691
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,559
versus like self-hosting that within

692
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,840
that same infrastructure

693
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,520
is there strong preferences either way

694
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,200
strong arguments for either of those

695
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,840
options

696
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
right sorry it was just repeating your

697
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
question so that's really about

698
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,679
would you go with software that you

699
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,080
already have in your suite versus

700
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,400
vendor provided software is that correct

701
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,279
yeah correct so

702
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,640
application components where there might

703
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,919
be that service provided as an

704
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:50,720
off-the-shelf thing

705
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,200
but you no longer have visibility of

706
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,880
what like how that might be operating

707
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
absolutely yeah um we struggled with

708
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
this one ourselves uh

709
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,159
because obviously you know many years

710
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,679
worth of infrastructure

711
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,840
investments over time so it's like do we

712
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,720
do you

713
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,159
use your investments that you already

714
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,919
have and build upon that

715
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,360
um or do you uh use

716
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,080
off-the-shelf easy to configure stuff

717
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,720
and i

718
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,279
guess the real answer is whatever works

719
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,159
for you

720
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,520
um at the moment we prefer just off the

721
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,880
shelf just because it's easy to

722
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
configure and do is

723
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,640
provide as code already configured but

724
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,480
some organizations may be able to do

725
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,080
that already within

726
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,640
uh within their cloud environment so

727
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,279
that's just

728
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,240
my personal experience but whatever

729
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,840
works for you is the answer i guess

730
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,919
anyone else so you mentioned

731
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,120
about um monitoring you know the cloud

732
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
provider updating

733
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,400
you know their their controls and having

734
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,159
to be in line with that

735
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,080
how do you manage that and monitor it

736
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,159
and then also look for misconfigurations

737
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,200
with those

738
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,440
multi-cloud environments is that sort of

739
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,480
a cspm

740
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,919
type direction you'd head in or is that

741
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,679
something you'd recommend and automate

742
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,559
that

743
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,679
yeah so um that's a good question so

744
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,480
part of that is uh a lot of cloud

745
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,159
providers provide bulletins around the

746
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,600
changes that are upcoming in their

747
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,640
environment um

748
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,039
regularly that's what i've noticed

749
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:19,679
anyway as

750
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,720
a cloud owner um but

751
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
there's also i guess you know blogs and

752
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,159
all that sort of stuff that come out

753
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,559
and various uh feeds that you can

754
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,399
incorporate but then on top of that you

755
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,080
also have i guess your vulnerability and

756
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,480
your

757
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
your security monitoring that you can

758
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,480
constantly refer to

759
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
if you do need to see you know what's

760
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,000
the state of my environment what's

761
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,799
changed

762
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,360
what's going on that might not have been

763
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,080
picked up by my secops teams or my cloud

764
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,720
teams

765
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,919
that i need to really be aware of um

766
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,159
i think there's also an alert section it

767
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,960
might be wrong yes

768
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,760
that you can view any sort of recent

769
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,720
changes

770
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,240
to your um to your cloud investments as

771
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,640
well

772
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
so so is that a centralized thing or is

773
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
that a no no

774
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,720
this is specific to in my experience uh

775
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,679
using azure

776
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,320
specifically uh we do use a very small

777
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,760
amount of aws but

778
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,399
we're still on this journey for aws at

779
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,760
the moment so

780
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,480
i can't speak for that but yeah for

781
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,919
actually

782
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:31,840
one more round of applause let's do it

783
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,479
you
