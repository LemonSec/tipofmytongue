1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,360
so for those that haven't been before

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,280
or even those that have you realize that

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,359
the talks we try and get for the day

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,279
are not all just deep dive tech talks

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,760
you saw in casey's talk there you know

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,359
awesome story but also some pretty

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,960
thought-provoking stuff there especially

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,160
towards the end

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,880
um we try and get a real mix red blue

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,320
tech non-tech um

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
and i'm actually quite interested in

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,520
this next one um

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,840
jordan's jordan's an ex-lawyer or are

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
you ever an ex-lawyer i don't know it's

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,399
kind of yeah

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,760
i have my license so don't hold that

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,120
against him

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,559
but this talk is all about active

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,160
defense or hacking back you know

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,600
and the legalities around that from

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
someone that is actually a lawyer so it

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
can talk to the law so please make

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,070
jordan feel welcome

24
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,719
[Music]

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,039
um yeah thank you for that uh

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,119
introduction out of um

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,640
all the introductions i've received

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
that's by far the most

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,000
recent one um

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
i did want to come out today and teach

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,360
you guys how to

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
uh hack but maybe we can catch up

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,000
um in the break and do that

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
um i am an australian lawyer

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,240
but i'm also a senior

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,280
cyber security advisor so i've tried to

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,119
blend both of those elements in

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,159
today's presentation

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
um so today um i'm going to tell you

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,360
a story um and it starts with

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,240
once upon a time and it ends with cool

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,399
story isn't it

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
so once upon a time there was a

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,040
guy named uh swim oh

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,680
and um by the way uh there's bonus

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,320
points

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,479
for all of you if you can determine the

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,399
real identity of swim

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
by the end of this presentation so

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,040
once upon a time there was a

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
guy named swim swim stands for

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,200
someone who isn't me

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,120
um so swim was uh laying back in his

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
hammock relaxing in the backyard of his

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
house

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
when he received an alert that someone

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
had accessed a file called passwords

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,319
from his personal dropbox swimmer

59
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,160
completely forgotten about it it must

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,879
have been about

61
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,160
three years ago where he set up those

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
canary tokens because someone had

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
interacted with the file on his dropbox

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,160
it automatically beaconed back an alert

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,319
to swim of the ip address that was

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,519
responsible

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
for these shenanigans so this was real

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,959
threat intelligence in real time

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,480
but swim's heart started to feel a

70
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
little bit heavy

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,879
as he vaguely recalled that he may have

72
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,480
put some malicious files in that

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
location as well

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,840
did he put malware in there even

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,080
temporarily

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
man and what about that spyware that he

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
had too

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,360
for swim they were strictly for research

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
purposes only

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
but what if the attacker who compromised

81
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,799
his dropbox

82
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,640
also found those kind of files and

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
uploaded them to the attacker's drop

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,840
server

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
which the attacker would have then

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,599
downloaded onto his own machine

87
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,440
i think most of you would agree it

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
serves the attacker right after all

89
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,319
the attacker would have stolen it from

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,760
swim

91
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,400
but what about swim was he up for any

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
liability here

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,840
swim had to get to the bottom of this

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,840
so swim went inside his house uh he

95
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,439
turned on his computer and he picked up

96
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,799
his phone

97
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,599
and he hit the forums and he laid out

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,720
his problem

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,439
and requested support for a solution he

100
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
also gave his mates a call

101
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,478
and asked for their opinion but he

102
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,918
quickly realized

103
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,479
that there was no consensus among those

104
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,919
that he asked

105
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,759
some people were saying that it was

106
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,040
highly illegal

107
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
and he'd be stitched up for hacking back

108
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,040
others were saying it's completely fine

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,639
and it will be considered a form of

110
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,759
active defense

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
which supposedly they said was legal

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
and others were saying it's all covered

113
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,360
in this shade of grey

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,639
but not to worry because no prosecutor

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,320
was ever going to prosecute him

116
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,600
for a crime given that swim was the

117
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,759
victim

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,160
so swim put on his uh problem-solving

119
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
hat

120
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,199
and tried to form some kind of structure

121
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
out of all this feedback that he was

122
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
getting

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
so first of all there was a difference

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,320
in what people were labeling it

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
and what was actually going on at a

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,759
deeper level

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,000
so swim started with the broader labels

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,880
first

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
and it seemed logical to swim that the

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
best he could make of it

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,160
was that hacking back

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,800
was like sending a missile into someone

133
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,520
else's space

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,240
monitoring for missiles coming at you

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,880
was like

136
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,759
passive defense and shooting missiles

137
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,160
down

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,240
when they crossed into your airspace or

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
launching limited

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
counter attacks in response to an attack

141
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,720
in your area

142
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
that's active defense

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,840
so perhaps the canary token was active

144
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,240
defense

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,039
but was the stolen malware and and

146
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,880
spyware really considered

147
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,520
hacking back

148
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,160
so swim was starting to get somewhere

149
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,479
to understand this problem but he needed

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,639
to drill down into what was going on at

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,960
a little bit of a deeper level

152
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
so later that afternoon whilst he was

153
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,319
celebrating his daughter's first

154
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,440
birthday

155
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,759
he picked up a napkin and he went and

156
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,880
sat down in the back

157
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,039
corner and he wrote out a spectrum of

158
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,440
five elements which were at play

159
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
and which were of increasing intensities

160
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,039
so first you had attribution

161
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,280
this was about identifying whose swim

162
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
attacker was

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
so this is something which happened with

164
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
the beaconing

165
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,319
which allowed swim to follow the file

166
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,759
back to where it

167
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,800
is and obtain the attacker's ip address

168
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
it did require the leaving of swim zone

169
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,199
systems and it did run the risk of

170
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
implicating innocent third parties but

171
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
there was definitely no immediate harm

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,199
to anyone else

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,360
next was infiltration

174
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,840
so this was about assessing the

175
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
attacker's computer

176
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,479
introducing code to their environment

177
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,560
collecting their files their keystrokes

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,039
their screenshots etc

179
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,880
or otherwise just gathering intel about

180
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,000
them and how they operate

181
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,520
so this was about following the

182
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,280
attackers back

183
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,520
and having a look around but not causing

184
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,240
any destruction

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,479
so this was probably the stage the

186
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,240
malware and the spyware were at at the

187
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,520
moment because he hadn't further

188
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,960
interacted with them

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
but they could provide opportunities if

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,319
he chose

191
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,840
at the next few stages so the next one

192
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
was deletion so this is about

193
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
infiltrating into the attacker's

194
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,240
environment

195
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,639
searching for the files that were stolen

196
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
and taking action to prevent those files

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,039
being used by the attacker

198
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,599
so perhaps by deleting them or

199
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,280
encrypting them

200
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,199
but it's about trying to recover what's

201
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,039
stolen

202
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,639
and prevent the attacker from

203
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,199
any type of use so it swims data

204
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,840
but it's in the attacker's environment

205
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
and there's a fine line

206
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,680
at this point between interfering with

207
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,080
swim's property versus the attacker's

208
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,840
computer so the next phase was

209
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
exploitation so that's about gaining

210
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
access to an attacker's computer

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
or network and asserting control to

212
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,000
prevent or

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,039
contain any further attacks so this

214
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,560
might include

215
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
interfering controlling assets

216
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
installing code creating confusion

217
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
deception misdirection

218
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,000
or even creating a sinkhole

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,120
it's at this stage where for swim

220
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
it feels like we would be taking things

221
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
a little bit too far

222
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,839
like we're crossing the lines um because

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,320
it

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,839
starts to feel like you're being the

225
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,040
attacker yourself

226
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,760
so the last phase was the destruction

227
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,320
phase

228
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,959
so this is about taking the attacker

229
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,040
it's assets it's infrastructure it's

230
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,839
information

231
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,080
out so

232
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
at this point we'd be well over the line

233
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,920
and we would be

234
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,160
a full-fledged vigilante

235
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,760
so thinking about this swim briefed a

236
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
sigh of relief

237
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
as he formed the hypothesis that surely

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,360
surely

239
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
exploitation and destruction were what's

240
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,880
illegal

241
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,760
and surely attribution is totally fine

242
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,440
and perhaps there's some gray around

243
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
infiltration or deletion but

244
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,720
surely that's going to be fine too

245
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,680
so given that his situation hadn't

246
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,360
escalated above level 2

247
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,279
at this stage he thought he had nothing

248
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,880
to worry about and he went back to

249
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,760
enjoying

250
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,880
his daughter's birthday party

251
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,920
but over the next few weeks swim did

252
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,120
some research

253
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
uh in the evenings after work he was

254
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,200
collecting information

255
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,079
to prove or disprove his hypothesis

256
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,399
so first of all he looked at the legal

257
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
position in australia

258
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
having a look at the basic laws in place

259
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
swim had some immediate concerns about

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
his situation

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,399
state and commonwealth laws all seem to

262
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:20,959
be written

263
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,240
fairly similar and they basically

264
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,279
prohibited

265
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,519
accessing a computer information without

266
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,320
authorization or without a right

267
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
that would mean his canary token his

268
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
malware his spyware

269
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,279
were in fact illegal actions even though

270
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,640
they had only reached

271
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,279
attribution and infiltration stages and

272
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,640
were caused by the attackers themselves

273
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
so prima facie the legislation in place

274
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,320
in australia

275
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,200
would preclude you from doing just about

276
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,880
anything with a computer without being

277
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,399
authorized to do it

278
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,640
or having a relevant right to do it like

279
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,120
a warrant

280
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
but what's immediately obvious is that

281
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,480
the laws are quite dated

282
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,120
and the intent behind them is to apply

283
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,079
to the attackers

284
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
so it's a little bit tricky to apply

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,120
those laws

286
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,959
into a posture where you're engaged in

287
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,360
active defense or hacking back

288
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,399
even though when doing so you do not

289
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,519
have authorized access

290
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
and you know the laws that are in place

291
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,160
that allow you to act in self-defense

292
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
when physically attacked

293
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
while they haven't yet been developed in

294
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
equivalent form

295
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
in the cyber realm but they should and

296
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
that's the expectation

297
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,480
so swim was starting to see why there

298
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
was a gray area is obvious now

299
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,640
any prosecutor would be focused on the

300
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,519
cyber criminals the attackers

301
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,600
and they're likely to know that if they

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,360
did try to prosecute a victim

303
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
it's only going to lead to changes in

304
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,399
the law or

305
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,040
favorability around the victim so it's

306
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,000
not a case

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,040
that they're inclined to win

308
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
so perhaps some activities like

309
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
attribution and infiltration might be

310
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
overlooked by law enforcement when

311
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,079
you're the

312
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,079
victim engaged in active defense

313
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,320
swim was quite curious about reading

314
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
into this issue further

315
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
so he sought out some contacts in the

316
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
industry

317
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,200
and met up with them for coffee he

318
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
explained his situation

319
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
and his framework for uh that he

320
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
developed for his thinking

321
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,160
uh and also the state of play uh with

322
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
australian laws

323
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,680
and what he found was that generally

324
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,320
people in industry were split when it

325
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
came to a positive view

326
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560
that active use of active defense

327
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,639
techniques

328
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
with only about 10 percent in favor of

329
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,079
moving towards legalizing hacking back

330
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
swim also met up for coffee with some

331
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
contacts uh

332
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,399
in the government to find out what was

333
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,000
the government's approach and that was

334
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
quite different

335
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,839
so the australian government were trying

336
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,720
to meet the increasing threat landscape

337
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,040
by giving its agents more training more

338
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,959
tools more funding

339
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,160
and particularly to the deep state a lot

340
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
more power

341
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
but there still did seem to be some

342
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,639
reluctance from the government

343
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,360
to overtly step in to help

344
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,560
so swim started to research this more

345
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,200
and more

346
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,399
around now what was taking place around

347
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,199
the globe

348
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
compared to what was taking place

349
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,839
domestically

350
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,240
and it seemed that the us had been

351
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
discussing the

352
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,399
active cyber defense certainty bill

353
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,279
since about 2017

354
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
and this bill would have lifted

355
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
restrictions on hacking back

356
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,760
by providing a legislative defense

357
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,320
to prosecution when defending against

358
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
unauthorized intrusions

359
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,839
an additional driver for this u s bill

360
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,920
was that the very nature of cybercrime

361
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
was making it very difficult for law

362
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,600
enforcement to respond to

363
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,639
and prosecute in a timely manner

364
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,199
so the bill would have allowed for

365
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,639
attribution

366
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,480
infiltration even deletion

367
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,320
and even so far as exploitation but just

368
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,680
falling short

369
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,560
of destruction now that's a lot of power

370
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,199
although it seemed that law enforcement

371
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,279
and government agencies in the u.s

372
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,040
preferred to have the sole remit and

373
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,959
responsibility for responding to cyber

374
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,240
crime

375
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,720
the logistical enormity that of that

376
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,440
task

377
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
coupled with the vital importance of

378
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,839
cyber security in the modern world

379
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,920
really did justify an exception to the

380
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,839
general principle against justice being

381
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,360
meted by out by victims

382
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,519
unsurprisingly this issue is occupying

383
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,360
the attention of policy makers in europe

384
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,680
with germany in particular sharing the

385
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,959
exact same view

386
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,480
as the us if you have a look at

387
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,000
china and russia they've been proactive

388
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,079
in both internet governance and cyber

389
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
security regulation

390
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
of which active defense strategy is an

391
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,839
essential component

392
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,360
as with china and russia singapore

393
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,600
has been a leader in proactive cyber

394
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,880
security in

395
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,560
the asia pacific four years

396
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,040
singapore has allowed private entities

397
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,600
to take

398
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,560
active defense measures by amending its

399
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
cyber security acts

400
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,839
and specifically it began

401
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,920
permitting the singapore government to

402
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
issue certificates

403
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,880
direct directing specified persons to

404
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,839
prevent

405
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,240
detect or counter specific threats

406
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,079
particularly when it comes to critical

407
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,560
infrastructure and the financial

408
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
services industry

409
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,320
that's when it really did hit swim

410
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,759
this was no longer about him making sure

411
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,040
he didn't get in trouble for the

412
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,759
beaconing the malware and the spyware

413
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,680
this was about getting australia to

414
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,079
solve a problem a big problem

415
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,839
and one which was confronting the world

416
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,759
swim noticed that verizon keeps

417
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,040
producing reports

418
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
which keep indicating the threat

419
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,120
landscape is evolving

420
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
organized criminals are turning to cyber

421
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,519
crime with increasing sophistication

422
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,320
and prevalence ransomware attacks are

423
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,720
plaguing australia supply chain attacks

424
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
are causing australia's regulators to

425
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,959
tighten their regulatory screws

426
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,040
and also to focus on the broader

427
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,839
ecosystems

428
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
the hacking laws haven't changed for

429
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
years

430
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,559
the government is trying to meet these

431
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,919
threats

432
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,359
but they don't have the sufficient

433
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,640
resourcing capabilities or capacities to

434
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,039
respond in a timely manner

435
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
and what's happening to australian

436
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,599
companies as a result of this

437
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,160
are we merely focusing on passive

438
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,959
defense

439
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,839
basic security controls firewalls

440
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,280
antivirus

441
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,199
patch management scanning and monitoring

442
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,640
swim was annoyed and he was certain that

443
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,600
something

444
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,399
needed to be done

445
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
so swim knuckle down over the uh

446
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,480
ensuring next few months

447
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,600
it became winter it became cold but the

448
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
fire within swim continued to burn

449
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,679
strongly

450
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,400
swim formulated some key priorities

451
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,080
which he thought would move things in a

452
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,760
better direction

453
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,440
the first was to facilitate better

454
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,000
communications

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,520
and information sharing between

456
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,200
australian businesses

457
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,120
broader industries and the broader

458
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,039
ecosystem

459
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,000
the second was of course to develop

460
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,480
greater

461
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
cyber deception capabilities and

462
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,120
increase the deployment of deception

463
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,360
technologies

464
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,240
now it's worth noting that both

465
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
information sharing and cyber deception

466
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
are forms of active defense

467
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,559
the third was to ensure governance was

468
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,240
accounted for with an appropriate

469
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,120
addendum to the

470
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,400
csf and last was to ensure

471
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,480
australia was making a step change when

472
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
it came to authorizing

473
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,760
active defense powers

474
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,160
so for swim it was no surprise that

475
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,480
cooperating with law enforcement

476
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,640
and the network of companies and

477
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,760
organizations that are combating hacking

478
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,440
was an important part of an active

479
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
defense strategy

480
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,960
the uk financial services industry

481
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,240
is a really good example very publicly

482
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,080
and annually and for some time they have

483
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,200
conducted industry-wide war games to

484
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
work

485
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,720
on this coordination aspect

486
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,039
we do know that it is happening in

487
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,720
australia at the enterprise level from

488
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
time to time

489
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,640
but behind closed doors and certainly

490
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,799
not so much in the public domain

491
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,039
but swim's intent was encouraging

492
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,280
australian small and medium businesses

493
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,039
to start to join in

494
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,240
that war game activity

495
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,039
swim was also passionate about cyber

496
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,400
deception

497
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
and he enrolled himself into a sans

498
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,679
active defense course

499
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,880
in that course uh swim learnt a little

500
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
bit more about increasing the overall

501
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,679
work

502
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,400
effort an attacker would have to expend

503
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,360
to break into your environment

504
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,559
specifically swim was tooled up

505
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,600
to waste the attacker's time

506
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
trap and contain attacks alert security

507
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,880
teams

508
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,440
to attack activity so that it could be

509
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
monitored

510
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,120
and also help with attribution and

511
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,760
discovery

512
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,559
swim filled with this tooling and

513
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,520
knowledge

514
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
began to litter the environments he

515
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,760
traversed with uh honey docks and

516
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,159
executables

517
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,559
swim u's well chosen file names to

518
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,039
attract attackers attention like

519
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,159
fake keypass databases and

520
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,039
fake network diagrams but a word of

521
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,640
advice from swim

522
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,360
just let others know in the organization

523
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,039
when you deploy

524
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,760
to avoid a whole heap of frustrations

525
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,400
down the track

526
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,000
if you're looking for some free tools

527
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,320
to consider when you are looking to get

528
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,679
familiar and just play around with

529
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,919
active defense strategies

530
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,679
one of the better starting points is the

531
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,960
honeypot

532
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,520
a relatively versatile one to tinker

533
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,400
with

534
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,799
and one that's well documented from a

535
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,080
usage standpoint

536
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,760
is open canary so open canary makes a

537
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,799
good starting point

538
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,000
because conceptually it's fairly simple

539
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
it runs services and triggers when

540
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,320
someone connects to them

541
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,679
and the services in question are

542
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,600
designed to emulate a particular device

543
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
configuration like windows

544
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,480
or linux server

545
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,080
so industry standards and best practice

546
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,440
to bring it all together

547
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,720
and as a bit of a tongue-in-cheek swim

548
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,679
built upon

549
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,400
existing frameworks and ideas and what

550
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,240
fell out of that was an addendum to the

551
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
nist csf domains

552
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,760
being a domain called revenge

553
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,000
so that category or that control

554
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,600
domain included you know stimulate

555
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,120
remorse

556
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,240
burn their tools hack back deploy and

557
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,159
deception tech

558
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,440
and collaborate with your peers um and

559
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,760
there were so many controls

560
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,880
uh within that domain venom poison have

561
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,080
what have you not

562
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,720
they've been uh tailored back to be

563
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,840
something that's professional and

564
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,360
appropriate

565
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,000
um swim recognized that there needed to

566
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,159
be some change in cyber security laws

567
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,919
particularly for prosecuting cyber

568
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,280
crimes

569
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,679
and that was something that was well uh

570
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,960
overdue

571
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,280
but swim was painfully aware that there

572
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,400
was still that canary token that malware

573
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,559
and spyware hack and he wasn't quite out

574
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,080
of the clear yet

575
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,039
so he did his best to lobby raise

576
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,400
awareness for this issue

577
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,880
but unfortunately the wills of the law

578
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,799
move slowly

579
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,240
and take time and

580
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,799
he might not be able to achieve this for

581
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,440
some time yet

582
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,880
but to be clear swim wasn't advocating

583
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,280
for

584
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,360
a wild west and he pulled the napkin out

585
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
of his pocket the one which he wrote on

586
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,240
his spectrum of five elements and he

587
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,919
looked at it and he concluded that at

588
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,320
least

589
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,720
attribution infiltration and probably

590
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
deletion would serve best

591
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
um as these are some of the lower risk

592
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
lower impact activities

593
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,280
that generally do make up uh what's

594
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,080
called active defense

595
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,039
so the outcome swim was looking for was

596
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,960
for the australian government to

597
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,760
change its outdated laws to put some new

598
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,640
rules in place

599
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,400
that tell you what you can do and what

600
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,159
you can't do

601
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,400
or at the very least to provide some

602
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,039
authorization um or deputy to australian

603
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,120
companies in certain circumstances to

604
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
give them space where they could work on

605
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,080
active defense

606
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,639
on their own

607
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,320
now with swim going through all of these

608
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,520
processes

609
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,679
uh he became pretty familiar with the

610
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,600
arguments for each side

611
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,960
and it was fairly contentious those

612
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,240
four hacking back tend to argue

613
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,400
that if cybercrime can be accurately

614
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,760
attributed

615
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
and that any kind of response is

616
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
reasonable and proportionate

617
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,799
in the absence of greater government

618
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,760
involvement

619
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,600
hacking back is really the only

620
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
realistic solution

621
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
to the increase in sophistication and

622
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,039
frequency in the threat landscape

623
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,400
those that are against hacking back

624
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
know that there's so many risks

625
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
associated with it

626
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,840
and it can have unintended questions

627
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,960
first there is considerable difficulty

628
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,600
associated with identifying the attacker

629
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,559
and

630
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,440
even if the hack works a victim may

631
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,159
simply have

632
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,200
invited further retaliation

633
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,799
now let's think about if australian

634
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,240
companies uh

635
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,240
pissed off china for example

636
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,840
what's going to happen there in terms of

637
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,080
retaliation

638
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,600
and how friendly do you think the

639
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,960
australian government will then be to

640
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,880
you

641
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,799
um second counter attacks can also

642
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,440
damage

643
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,520
any hijacked computers belonging to

644
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
innocent third parties

645
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,080
and that is a real kind of grave concern

646
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,039
and third most companies don't have the

647
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,760
skill set

648
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,919
internally to effectively take

649
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,440
affirmative counter measures against

650
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,679
cyber criminals

651
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,279
they're finding it hard enough at the

652
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,520
moment to implement defense mechanisms

653
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,240
to prevent

654
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,960
attacks in the first place let alone

655
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
having to focus on arming staff

656
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
with the skill set to effectively hack

657
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,880
back

658
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
as this takes this to an unprecedented

659
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,640
unprecedent precedented level

660
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,799
so i might just pause a swim story there

661
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,240
because we have

662
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,960
many bright minds in the room and i

663
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,799
think it's important

664
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
to find out what everyone here thinks

665
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,480
about

666
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,320
australian private companies hacking

667
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
back or engaging

668
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,520
in active defense so we'll start with

669
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,559
the uh hell yes so i'll count to three

670
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,000
and if you're a hell yes put up your

671
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,080
hand and say hell yes

672
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,000
one two three

673
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,720
okay if you're a hell no

674
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,640
on three say hell no and put up your

675
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,840
hands one

676
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,639
two three

677
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,760
oh man i think that's gonna have to be

678
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,720
50 50 unfortunately

679
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,840
a heated battle and a tie even in here

680
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,200
so the moral of the story is

681
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,799
first please please please don't go out

682
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,320
and do what i did i i

683
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,320
i mean i mean i mean please don't go out

684
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,279
and do what swim did

685
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,720
wait did i just give away the true

686
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,440
identity of swim

687
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,960
maybe not well anyway um i'm not

688
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,080
advocating

689
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,200
that we should all go out and head

690
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
gung-ho to a wild west with full blown

691
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,919
uh hacking back but what i am proposing

692
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,679
is that the time has come

693
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,600
to permit hacking back in particular

694
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,120
circumstances

695
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,039
and perhaps we should all allow for a

696
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,200
step change

697
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
a little bit further down the higher

698
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
risk and higher impact

699
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,039
pathway of active defense

700
00:27:47,039 --> 00:28:03,840
so cool story isn't it

701
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,678
you
