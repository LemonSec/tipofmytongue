1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,200
[Applause]

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,839
i am

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,359
here not to make you feel better about

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,080
it because it does not get better

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,039
um yeah so before i dive into kind of

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,640
the really interesting stuff and the

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,840
things that you're actually here to

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,720
listen to

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
before i get off the stage so you can

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,519
actually hear the things you want to

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,640
hear

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
my name is georgia and basically you've

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,559
wound up listening to this

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,480
kind of scrawny little kid talk here

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,079
today because of a new mantra that i

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,680
adopted in my life

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
and that's kind of to just say yes and

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,520
do something that scares you every

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,640
single day

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,879
so i don't public speak so this is a bit

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,000
of a thing

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,559
so i got my palm cards and i plugged my

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,120
usb

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
in so hopefully that kind of breaks the

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,480
tension

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
yeah yeah it was a um a brave move

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,160
plugging a usb in at a cyber security

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,600
conference

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
but um i've been in cyber for about

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,760
three years now

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
um part full time i came straight in

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,560
from a bachelor's

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,880
in security studies into the cyber realm

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
so i've always felt

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
a little out of my element and i thought

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
you know what's a better way than

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,479
to fix that then get in front of a big

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,240
group of people who seem to be speaking

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
every single day

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
who are also in the industry and then

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,200
give

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
a public speech about something in the

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,479
industry uh

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,479
yeah so that's that's what i decided to

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
do and that's why you guys are

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,679
sitting here listening to me talk

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,360
i became interested in intelligence

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,320
consumption

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,560
and social media manipulation during my

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,520
studies

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,479
and it's an area of keen interest that

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,680
led me into

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,040
kind of what i'm here to talk about

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
today which is cognitive hacking so

55
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,399
the the problem like let's break it down

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,000
we've got the problem

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,880
i mean 2020 was a problem in itself it

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,159
was a hell of a year

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,560
and i'm not just referring to the

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
pandemic

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
the u.s election the wildfires

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,160
or even the murder hornets in the u.s

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,840
but i'm also talking about the rapid

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,160
growth of social media platforms like

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
tick tock

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
the rise of zoom or if you're on the

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,080
other party the dreaded teens um

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
and their role and the role that they

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
played in facilitating our everyday

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
interactions in our workforces

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,319
and they would just the unprecedented

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,120
number of

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,879
years of digital transformation that we

74
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,879
went through in just a few months

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,800
what last year also brought home to me

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,519
at least was the strength reach and

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,120
influence that a lot of these medians

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
have in the way that we

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
think feel and behave i mean how many

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,720
people now

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
are dancing on the side of the street

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
with a camera

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,959
but the manipulation of social media has

84
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,840
now become

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,640
common practice and it's given rise to

86
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,239
the dangerous normalization

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
of cognitive hacking cognitive hacking

88
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,560
in short is the manipulation of

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,760
information media

90
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
in order to subconsciously influence a

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,120
demographic

92
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
which means to influence others to think

93
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,640
or act in a

94
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
certain way to achieve an end goal

95
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,599
this vulnerability is being increasingly

96
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,799
exploited by

97
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,040
nation states but not just in nation

98
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,159
states also being

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,879
increasingly exploited by opportunistic

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
individuals alike

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
the rise of social media cyber

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,720
innovation and communications technology

103
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,239
has given nefarious actors unprecedented

104
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,200
access

105
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,000
and ability to cause fundamental shifts

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
in the way that targeted demographics

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
think and behave

108
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
often these ways are actually quite

109
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,119
subtle and imperceivable

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
what we've found is that perpetrators

111
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,400
are able to manipulate information

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,760
to the point where it's become

113
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,319
weaponized and it's now a tool by which

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,360
subtle warfare

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
is able to be waged

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,120
recently the cadence of concerted

117
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
disinformation

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
campaigns has proliferated immensely

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
with inflammatory false or extremist

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,079
narratives

121
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,040
being used to conduct war destabilize

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
populations

123
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,520
and even cause reputational damage

124
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
but to say that cognitive hacking is new

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,320
would be a lie

126
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360
in fact it's far older than the internet

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,320
yourself or even your sony walkman

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,720
it's an outdated joke for a millennial

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,199
but we'll go with it

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,600
the um the use of information in the

131
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
media to wage war

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
is far removed from the traditional

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,759
concepts that we know of warfare

134
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
but is surged in popularity amongst

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,280
actors today

136
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,919
and that's because it's cheap it's

137
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,600
largely risk-free

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
it's readily accessible and arguably

139
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,840
it's easy to do

140
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
arguably i'm in grc

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
effective cognitive hacking affords

142
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,639
those who wage it

143
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
the same parody of power as though they

144
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,479
were fighting a knife fight with an

145
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
assault rifle

146
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,199
and the consequences of targeted attacks

147
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,759
include not just massive long-term

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,919
economic and reputational harm

149
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,199
but it can actually bring about

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,240
widespread damage civil unrest

151
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
and the loss of human lives

152
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
so the cost of cognitive hacking is just

153
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
a mere pittance

154
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
in comparison to buying a single

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
conventional weapon

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
forgive me for this being in the us

157
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,800
dollars but

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
you get the same idea reports from trend

159
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,680
micro

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
found that it cost just two thousand

161
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,479
six hundred dollars to buy a social

162
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
media account that had

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,840
three hundred thousand plus followers

164
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,479
it also would cost 55 000 us dollars

165
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,120
to successfully fund a discrediting

166
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
twitter attack on someone

167
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,039
and it costs only four hundred thousand

168
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,919
dollars

169
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,560
to influence policy trade agreements

170
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,400
impact elections

171
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
or even change the course of a

172
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
referendum

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,720
now i'm not sure about you guys but the

174
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,639
prospect of spending just

175
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,160
four hundred thousand dollars and

176
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
to influence say an election outcome

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,919
whilst maintaining

178
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,720
a degree of plausible deniability

179
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
instead of spending what forbes

180
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
estimated was

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,680
approxim approximately 178 billion

182
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
dollars by the pentagon

183
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,840
in one financial year alone for military

184
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,880
technology

185
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
that's not only attributable but then it

186
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,840
also requires additional maintenance

187
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,280
training and operational costs

188
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,639
well the difference between that just

189
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,960
sells itself

190
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,240
so i'll admit whilst the 178 billion

191
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,720
dollars

192
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,520
wouldn't be spent on every single

193
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,319
operation

194
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,880
and it would be part of a weapons

195
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,680
development and

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,479
acquisitions program the sheer

197
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,160
difference in cost

198
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
but also the opportunity to leave

199
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
subtle impacts in group think and in

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
other direct consequences at such

201
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,039
scale proves that spending on cognitive

202
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,479
hacking campaigns

203
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,880
is far more beneficial than conventional

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
military spending

205
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,039
and what is becoming increasingly common

206
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,440
is that it's notoriously difficult to

207
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,919
pinpoint where these campaigns originate

208
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,759
and whether they're state-sponsored or

209
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
rogue individuals

210
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,960
in fact in many cases it's likely that

211
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
even the actors carrying out the

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
profiles and activities themselves

213
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
don't exactly know by who

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
or to what ends their actions are

215
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,120
directed

216
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,599
so then we go into the evidence and the

217
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,240
details

218
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
efforts of cognitive hacking like i

219
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,360
mentioned before are by no means new

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,520
so there have been examples of concerted

221
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,120
efforts to create tools that could

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,599
influence the population behavior

223
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,560
extending all the way back to the 1960s

224
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,639
and it seems that in the us

225
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,479
democrats have had their fingers on the

226
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
trigger long before concerted campaigns

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,080
like you and i would know

228
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
have been waged in u.s politics recently

229
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,399
the similmatics corporation the name

230
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,479
being a combination of simulation

231
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,559
and automatic well they opened for

232
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
business in 1959

233
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
simulmatics have actually been credited

234
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
with pioneering data manipulation

235
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,640
and using data and technology to develop

236
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,360
a tool

237
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
that was able to predict and influence

238
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,760
people to change their mind and think a

239
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
certain way

240
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
especially on topics as broad as

241
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,440
purchasing preferences

242
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,640
to their voting behavior so they did

243
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
this through the use of a program known

244
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,880
as the people machine

245
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
which was in part attributed to the

246
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,800
election of jfk

247
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,480
as president in 1960

248
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,440
the people machine used data mining

249
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,800
techniques like you and i would know

250
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
today

251
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
to create a model of the voting

252
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,600
population that would then tell you how

253
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,880
voters would respond to certain messages

254
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,959
it was these responses that then

255
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,040
influenced the methods of how

256
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,760
in this case the jfk campaign would then

257
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,680
mobilize and speak to the populace

258
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,720
now if that isn't enough to elicit at

259
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
least some concern for you

260
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,880
then here's some more recent and salient

261
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
examples

262
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
such as the sheer power of cognitive

263
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
hacking can be seen

264
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
in cambridge analytica now

265
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,399
the cambridge analytica go brexit that's

266
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
kind of been done to death

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
but cambridge analytica a data analytics

268
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,320
firm in the us

269
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,399
did influence arguably one of the

270
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,240
biggest events seen in the last five

271
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,519
years and that wasn't the 2021 election

272
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,360
but the u.s 2016 election

273
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,560
in 2016 donald trump's campaign team

274
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
bought the data harvested by cambridge

275
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,839
analytica

276
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,360
and this was data regarding the

277
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,680
personalities of u.s citizens

278
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,920
and they used this to target voters on

279
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,000
social media

280
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
so where you had a swing voter that

281
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,040
person would be

282
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
inundated with advertisements that

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,160
highlighted

284
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,079
negative images and ideas of hillary

285
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,680
clinton

286
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,519
while those who displayed pro-trump

287
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
qualities would be shown victorious

288
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,519
images of trump

289
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,760
probably holding one of the amendments

290
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
upside down in his hand

291
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,680
and information on where they'd be able

292
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,079
to go and vote for him

293
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,200
so while the use of these ads can't we

294
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
we can't claim them to be the sole

295
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,480
reason that he won

296
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,160
um advertising does have impact value

297
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
and the inundation of promotional

298
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,160
material that played on individuals

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,680
innermost fears

300
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,200
undoubtedly played a role in the

301
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,640
mobilization of that vote

302
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,560
another prime example that i'm sure a

303
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,720
lot of you are already aware of

304
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
is a group that's been conducting and

305
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
waging conservative

306
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
cognitive hacking is the internet

307
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
research agency

308
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,120
so the internet research agency are a

309
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,200
kremlin-led troll factory

310
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,399
and they're thought to have been the

311
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
instigator of discord and disunity in

312
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,839
the united states

313
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,959
a number of times in recent years they

314
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,040
do this by stoking both sides of

315
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,639
emotional and political

316
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,320
and ideological debates an influence

317
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,040
operation

318
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
also known as project lacta actually

319
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,639
generated divisive social media posts

320
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,360
for both sides of one argument

321
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
significant social causes they targeted

322
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:05,839
like

323
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,360
lgbt rights and gun control

324
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,320
with an operational budget of 10 million

325
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,200
us dollars

326
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
for only the first half of 2018

327
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
the group were able to use things like

328
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
sock puppet accounts to promote and

329
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,760
inflame viewpoints

330
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
and then encourage a real world protest

331
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,839
and then in response to that a

332
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,200
counter-protest

333
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
which would actually elicit violence in

334
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,079
some cases

335
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,040
similar to the internet research agency

336
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
the chinese government has also been

337
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,000
embroiled in

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,320
manipulating social media to influence

339
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,079
opinion and create

340
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,560
in some cases overwhelming amount of

341
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,279
popular

342
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,079
pro-regime messages supporting xi

343
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,120
jinping's communist party

344
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
according to a study conducted by

345
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
harvard university a group also known as

346
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,360
the 50 cent party

347
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,279
aptly named for the amount of money they

348
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,240
received for each post they create

349
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,959
was hired by the chinese government to

350
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,279
create content that framed the political

351
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,760
party in power in a positive light

352
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
and they use this particularly in times

353
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
of political instability

354
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,920
political instability for example in the

355
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,880
wake and

356
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,399
outbreak of deadly 2013 ethnic riots in

357
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,040
the xinjiang province

358
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
during this time there were hundreds of

359
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,200
pro-beijing messages posted online

360
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,519
to counter a lot of negative news that

361
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,279
was coming out

362
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,320
but not only that it's thought that

363
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,240
around

364
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,600
240 million of 488 total

365
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,920
million propaganda messages were

366
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
actually posted on a slew of

367
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,519
social media networks during that time

368
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,160
by this group

369
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,360
interestingly enough though the aims and

370
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,040
objectives of this group

371
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,199
wasn't to spread disinformation in this

372
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,320
example

373
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,440
but it was actually to pay staff to

374
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,519
manipulate social media

375
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,279
in an effort to provide a counter

376
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,560
narrative

377
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
to the negative news and opposing

378
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,760
messages

379
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
but instead with the intention of

380
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
distracting the population from the

381
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
criticism

382
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,320
so a lot of the examples that i've

383
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
spoken about today have

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,720
been relation to political ends that

385
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,079
cognitive hacking might take

386
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,519
place but cognitive hacking is also used

387
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,240
to bring about

388
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
financial gain and could also be

389
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,079
directed towards creating financial

390
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,399
windfall

391
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,399
for example i'm not sure how many of you

392
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,240
remember this i was too busy tweeting

393
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,079
justin bieber this time

394
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,440
but in 2014 during a time of heightened

395
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,600
sensitivity around terrorism

396
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
this was coming at a time just after the

397
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
boston marathon bombing

398
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,199
actors actually compromised the

399
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,519
associated press twitter page

400
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,839
and they tweeted out that there had been

401
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,839
two explosions in the white house

402
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,959
and at the time president obama

403
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,040
had been injured as a result of this

404
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,079
tweet

405
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,440
the dow jones plunged over 140 points

406
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
and the dollar and the yen also

407
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
temporarily plunged

408
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
reuters estimated that the event

409
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,320
resulted in a temporary loss of market

410
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
capitalization in the s p

411
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,079
500 alone to be about 136 and a half

412
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,720
billion dollars

413
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,399
i don't really understand the financial

414
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,360
stuff i'm still young

415
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,680
straight over whether this financial

416
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,880
consequence was an intended objective

417
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,560
it does highlight the potential

418
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
financial consequences

419
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,639
in this case that preying on current

420
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,720
socio-political fears

421
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,240
cognitive hacking can actually bring

422
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,560
about

423
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,560
so the use of cognitive hacking

424
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,079
information manipulation

425
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,959
and influence operations as a mode of

426
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,240
warfare

427
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,600
well in modern conflict that's expanded

428
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,639
the scope of the battlefield

429
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,880
and that's expanded the ability for us

430
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,399
to conduct war

431
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,399
out of the purview of the state and

432
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,920
state actors

433
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,000
and into the hands of the girl next door

434
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,759
and that's uh that's me at christmas

435
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,519
so i go hard at christmas

436
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,639
cognitive hacking has been used by

437
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,000
nation state actors to conduct war and

438
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,079
as a result this has contributed to the

439
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,399
blurring of previously well-defined

440
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,920
battlefield borders this is because

441
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,959
state actors have moved to sponsor

442
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,079
or outsource the conduct of battle to

443
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,920
actors in the cyber landscape

444
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
and we notice this by the cyber threat

445
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,600
landscape always increasing

446
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,399
for example while russia hasn't

447
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,639
necessarily sent their military in

448
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,799
guns blazing to pillage the land with

449
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,559
their opposition

450
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,199
they do and have supported the efforts

451
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,480
of hacking groups

452
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
such as apt-29 more commonly referred to

453
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,079
as cozy bear and they've done that for

454
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,640
the same effect

455
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,760
cody bear are employed

456
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,640
we'll say sponsored by the russian

457
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
government and the kremlin

458
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,400
to conduct sophisticated campaigns and

459
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,600
these campaigns are aimed at covertly

460
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,880
subverting

461
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,360
interfering and destabilizing their

462
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,919
opponents to the same extent

463
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,160
if not more so than what would be caused

464
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,840
by conventional warfare itself

465
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,280
while we can't attribute the attacks

466
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
with a hundred percent certainty to them

467
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,559
it's it's never a certain thing uh many

468
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,160
security practitioners

469
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
have attributed a lot of events to these

470
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,760
groups or this group

471
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,600
in particular cozy bear

472
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,880
are just one tool in the kremlin's

473
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,000
arsenal via which they can wage war

474
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,480
however because this group is

475
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
supported by the kremlin we'll say they

476
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,520
say

477
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,200
supported uh by the kremlin and russian

478
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,000
intelligence

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,160
and not actually waged by them

480
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,960
because it's outsourced the russian

481
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
government is afforded a degree of

482
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,760
separation

483
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
and plausible deniability that they

484
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
wouldn't otherwise have had

485
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,840
were they to engage in a conventional

486
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
battle

487
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,600
so another key tool that's taking uh

488
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,160
the art of information manipulation to

489
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,679
dizzying heights

490
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,039
is this the deep fake

491
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,880
we're entering an era in which our

492
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
enemies can make it look like anyone is

493
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,280
saying anything at any point in time

494
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,640
even if they would never say those

495
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,440
things so

496
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,360
for instance they could have me say

497
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
things like

498
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,559
i don't know killmonger was right

499
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,600
or ben carson is in the sunken place

500
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,039
or how about this simply president trump

501
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,000
is a total and complete

502
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,360
all right so this is a deep fake video

503
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,679
and as a cyber security practitioner i

504
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,799
can tell you now

505
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,480
that we're seeing this develop as an

506
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
emerging threat

507
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,320
a deep fake video for those of you that

508
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,520
might not know

509
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,919
is a video of a person in which their

510
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,840
face or their body has been digitally

511
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
altered so that they appear to be either

512
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,039
someone else

513
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,360
and this is typically used maliciously

514
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
or to spread false

515
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,760
misinformation

516
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,039
terrifyingly just by doing a simple

517
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,080
google search

518
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
uh you're able to find free online deep

519
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,440
fake generators

520
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
that offer services and software that

521
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,679
allow you to create your own legitimate

522
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,240
deep fake video

523
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,280
so these pose a particular challenge not

524
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
just because they play homage to the

525
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,799
scene as believing

526
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,640
but because for those that are well

527
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,480
designed they can actually be

528
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
extremely difficult to detect and they

529
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
require significant

530
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,120
and time-consuming video analysis to

531
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
break down

532
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,360
what we're also seeing is the use of

533
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,320
deep fakes by opposing political parties

534
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,679
to discredit the other side and donald

535
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,480
trump

536
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,000
was a prime example of this uh

537
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,559
last year when he tweeted a manipulated

538
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,520
video of

539
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,799
nancy pelosi we want to give this

540
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,080
president the opportunity

541
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,280
to something historic for

542
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,840
our country we want to give this

543
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,640
president

544
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,400
the opportunity to do something historic

545
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,880
for our country what you can see in this

546
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
video is that it's actually been slowed

547
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,360
down

548
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,640
and nancy pelosi so this was um called

549
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
out by a group called politics watchdog

550
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,400
and in this um in this video nancy

551
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,280
pelosi has

552
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
actually been slowed down and her voice

553
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,480
slurred a little bit

554
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,120
so that she appears quite inebriated and

555
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,159
incoherent

556
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,400
and for poor nancy this is just one

557
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,919
video but it's happened about two or

558
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,679
three times now

559
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,720
um so what's been done to actually solve

560
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,679
this problem

561
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,679
or more importantly what can we do

562
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,960
well this isn't going to make 2021 any

563
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,000
better

564
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,240
as i mentioned before and what's quite

565
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,679
troubling for me

566
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,559
is that as a cyber security practitioner

567
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
i actually don't think there's

568
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,559
at least any one solution to this

569
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,760
problem

570
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,200
um in 2009 so troubled by the

571
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,720
development and the use

572
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,840
of cyber operations and cyber warfare a

573
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,320
group of international legal and

574
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,120
uh prac scholars and practitioners

575
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
convened and drafted what

576
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
became known as the talon manual and

577
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,080
then later on in 2017 the thailand

578
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,159
manual 2.0

579
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,799
so originally this actually focused on

580
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,080
cyber operations

581
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,640
such as cognitive hacking this was

582
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,280
focused

583
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,760
by and large on the most disruptive and

584
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,720
destructive

585
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
destructive cyber operations and these

586
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,880
were those that took place between

587
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,760
states

588
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
and those that might actually elicit a

589
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,200
kinetic response between

590
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,240
states although in 2.0

591
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,520
the scope expanded it's conflict it's

592
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,159
focused

593
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,960
on conflict between nation states and

594
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,480
the reality of

595
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,320
cognitive hacking if i haven't

596
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
introduced that by my christmas videos

597
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,760
is that information warfare is

598
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,480
irregular and asymmetric in nature and

599
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
is going to be waged by state and

600
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
non-state actors together

601
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,240
other efforts at combating the problem

602
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
of cognitive hacking

603
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,559
have actually been seen in china but

604
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,640
china moved to more isolationist

605
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
protective measures to prevent

606
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
the impact of this threat on their

607
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,240
population and they did this by

608
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,120
regulating

609
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,200
their own internet through the great

610
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,080
firewall of china

611
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,440
this great firewall was proposed as a

612
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
method of preventing foreign

613
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
interference by other countries in the

614
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,360
internal affairs of china

615
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,919
it's made up of active filtering to

616
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,039
prevent content

617
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,080
from being accessed internally it's

618
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,360
made up of probing which probes networks

619
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
services such as vpn or tor that could

620
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,200
potentially circumvent

621
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,760
the firewall and it's also made up of

622
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,600
proxy distribution technologies

623
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,880
one problem that i see with this is that

624
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,080
the communist party

625
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,159
and similarly any other government who

626
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,080
imposes these means

627
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,559
still has the ability to influence the

628
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,279
messages

629
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,919
that do reach the population and by

630
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,440
doing this they're actually able to

631
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,240
significantly censor the population and

632
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,279
if they want to

633
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,120
punish those who disagree with certain

634
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,918
ideologies

635
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,120
not only that but things like the great

636
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,919
internet firewall of china a lot of

637
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,360
those measures are quite

638
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,480
increment incongruous with a lot of our

639
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,919
democratic social norms

640
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,799
another potential but also high risk and

641
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,000
controversial

642
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,120
solution would be to block certain

643
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
communications to a population or group

644
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
of people

645
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,600
while however this might limit the

646
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,159
exposure of influential content and some

647
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,480
cognitive hacking campaigns

648
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,520
reaching a demographic

649
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,080
the blocking of a lot of communication

650
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,120
and information

651
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,720
might be perceived as threatening to

652
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320
human rights uh

653
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,080
it might be used to cover up other

654
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,360
abuses of power

655
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,840
and cover up other content from other

656
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,520
countries

657
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,120
another possibility would be to continue

658
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,360
pressing on educating people regarding

659
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
awareness and cyber hygiene

660
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,400
but as a security consultant who spends

661
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,520
a lot of time

662
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,159
and effort pursuing these ends i must

663
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,320
confess that i really do have serious

664
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,080
doubts about the efficacy of these

665
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
endeavors

666
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
then you have the other regularly

667
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,039
commonly suggested silver bullet which

668
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,360
is to simply regulate big social media

669
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,559
companies

670
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,120
but i think that we can all agree that

671
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,640
in actuality

672
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
the viability of this in such a complex

673
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,799
and dynamic landscape is really moot

674
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,279
i mean a prime example of this would be

675
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,039
a recent attempt

676
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,240
by the digital industry group or digi uh

677
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,080
who released a code of practice for

678
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,000
social media platforms that had

679
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,080
seven objectives and one of these

680
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,760
objectives was

681
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,159
the goal of tackling disinformation in

682
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,600
advertisements

683
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
prioritizing news content that have been

684
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,720
fact checked

685
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,360
we all know how that went for australia

686
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
and improving political advertising that

687
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,320
takes place

688
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,640
however this is all very nice in theory

689
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,200
but while big names like tik tok

690
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
facebook and google have signed up to

691
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
this code

692
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,159
bringing it back to what i previously

693
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,480
said the viability of this

694
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
is moot and attempts are really

695
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,400
half-hearted at best

696
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,240
this code is actually completely

697
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
voluntary to ratify

698
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,400
and for signatories that do sign up to

699
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,120
it

700
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
they're able to pick and choose the

701
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,039
parts of it that they want to codify

702
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,840
and those that they don't so where for

703
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,640
example

704
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,039
facebook's bottom line is going to be

705
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,799
negatively impacted through

706
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,520
advertising revenue i don't think that

707
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
you would sign up to that

708
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
i might be a bit pessimistic but that's

709
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,400
that's just me

710
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,000
to further this uh any attempts by

711
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,240
states and international institutions

712
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,679
to codify the laws of war for the cyber

713
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,200
and ict realm

714
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
they're going to be fraught with the

715
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,640
same difficulties of conventional

716
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
protocols and doctrines

717
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,880
and that's that states can choose to

718
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,720
abide and ratify them at their

719
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,559
discretion

720
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,080
so i was recently asked to speak at a un

721
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,919
working group about the issue of

722
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,360
cognitive hacking

723
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
it was all on zoom though this is my

724
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,000
first irl

725
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,520
and you know how cognitive hacking was a

726
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
major threat to international peace and

727
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,480
security

728
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,279
and then how can we help combat this

729
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,720
issue

730
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,760
but i found myself with the same problem

731
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,640
and this was an audience and people that

732
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,600
have

733
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,240
significant influence and significant

734
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
tools at their disposal

735
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,799
and you know they could get whatever

736
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,559
they wanted at their beck and call

737
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,760
but i still had that same problem

738
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,440
so to be honest

739
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,279
i'm still of the opinion that there's

740
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,240
going to be very little that can be done

741
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,960
so what does that really mean for us

742
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
well sorry i told you it wasn't going to

743
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,320
be a great hopeful

744
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,720
inspiring we can we can solve this but

745
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,640
it's not

746
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,399
um i think that we've got a fair trot to

747
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:24,799
go

748
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,480
and we've got a fair bit of work in

749
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
front of us and that might actually be

750
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,640
good news to a lot of us

751
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,320
it is possible that by increasing

752
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,399
the increasing use of cognitive hacking

753
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,840
by countries is going to become

754
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,640
a new normal similar to how there was an

755
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
erosion of privacy with

756
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,200
the advent of the digital age as we

757
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,159
continue to

758
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,559
become more connected to global

759
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,799
communications and social media

760
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,000
the landscape that cognitive hacking can

761
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,240
but the landscape that it will take

762
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,799
place is only going to grow

763
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,600
and i believe it's going to be something

764
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,200
that we need to embrace

765
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
if not embrace then accept

766
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,880
understanding and embracing the fact

767
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,240
that these campaigns are going to

768
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,559
continue to exist and take place

769
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,799
is going to allow us to focus our

770
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,720
attention on being able to combat them

771
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,159
by raising awareness

772
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,120
but also by raising our capabilities to

773
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,760
critically

774
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
analyze the information that we receive

775
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,760
every day on these platforms

776
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,399
personally though back to my pessimistic

777
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,679
attitude i've kind of

778
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,440
ceded acceptance to the fact that

779
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,679
cognitive hacking is taking place

780
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,440
and that it's going to continue to be

781
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,200
conducted at great lengths in the future

782
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,080
i believe that this will influence the

783
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,520
work we do as cyber security

784
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,640
practitioners

785
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,120
and that a large part of our future is

786
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,000
actually going to be

787
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,559
spent re-establishing the erosion of

788
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,799
trust that efforts of cognitive hacking

789
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,240
spend mere minutes destroying

790
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,399
when it comes to my own approach to

791
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,559
information media

792
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,600
i take each article each advertisement

793
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,480
and each message with a grain of salt i

794
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,080
think about why i might be on the

795
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,240
receiving end of it and how it actually

796
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,320
makes me feel

797
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,480
i feel that displaying this type of

798
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,399
critical analysis when you get these

799
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,120
messages

800
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,440
and these feelings or these influences

801
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,559
are being exerted

802
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,799
is probably going to be a way of the

803
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,919
future and i

804
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,360
encourage you guys all to do the same

805
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,639
and that's my first irl talk round of

806
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
applause

807
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,720
i'm just watching v's gonna run back in

808
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,159
uh has anyone got a question

809
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,760
stick your hand up and i will bring the

810
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,480
mic out to you someone's gotta

811
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,840
feel as depressed as i do yeah i mean

812
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,480
11 30 a.m it's time to drink something

813
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,000
my kids are still little so i'm just

814
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
hoping by the time they're old enough to

815
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,279
to use social media we will have

816
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,960
realized it was a mistake

817
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,720
and and maybe have started again but i

818
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,080
think there is very little chance of

819
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,799
that happening

820
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,240
so nice yeah

821
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,600
hello hey uh yeah hey joshua um

822
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,039
really enjoyed the talk well done um

823
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,760
just wondering at least the cognitive

824
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,399
hacking

825
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,600
that is done by nation state actors

826
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,480
is it related to or even synonymous with

827
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,200
um

828
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,320
psychological operations oh yeah exactly

829
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,559
so like a lot of it is psychological

830
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,000
operations to actually get

831
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,840
someone to behave in a way that they

832
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,440
want um

833
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,720
a lot of the time even with uh nation

834
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,320
states it could just be

835
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,640
to let other nation states know that

836
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,440
you're there

837
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,279
and then there's that fear in the back

838
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,640
of your mind that's you know

839
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
someone's actually out there and someone

840
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,480
has the same capabilities as me

841
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,919
so even if it isn't always to be

842
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,399
done uh directly on an individual or

843
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,080
play on an individual fear

844
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,760
a lot of nation states will actually

845
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
engage in psychological warfare

846
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,000
through cognitive hacking just to let

847
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,080
other nation states know they're there

848
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
okay that's disturbing yeah it is

849
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,039
disturbing isn't it

850
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,159
there was one down the back there

851
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,960
somewhere just looking towards the

852
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,000
future do you think

853
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
people are going to start developing the

854
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,399
same cynicism we have to advertising for

855
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,760
cognitive hacking

856
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,919
i think that will come with each

857
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,000
individual

858
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,080
and i think it's probably a bit of an

859
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,600
awareness thing as well

860
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,519
i don't think if you're not aware of the

861
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,279
threat you're not really likely to

862
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,360
display those critically

863
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,159
all that critical analysis that maybe

864
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,320
myself or you would actually display

865
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,919
but i think it would be a good idea

866
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,600
for it to be displayed more in the

867
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,440
future

868
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,559
because like i can't really log on to

869
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,799
nine now and think that you know

870
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,320
the bachelor is is all that

871
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,720
um yeah there's a there's a lot of stuff

872
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,600
that i think it's

873
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,399
critical analysis is going to be the way

874
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:10,880
of

875
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,760
the future marco up the back and then

876
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,640
there was one on this side

877
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,120
um thank you for your talk it's really

878
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,080
good

879
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,200
i know this is a bit of a leap in when

880
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
you're running an application if you're

881
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
trying to run it in a trusted

882
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,120
environment you're supposed to follow a

883
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,399
trust chain

884
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,240
from the very beginning so that at least

885
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,320
when the application runs you can verify

886
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,080
if it's definitely application you're

887
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,960
expecting and where it came from

888
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,159
when um at least entities like

889
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,600
governments or those who have an

890
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,559
enormous amount of influence and power

891
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,480
would it be possible to consider that

892
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:48,799
they

893
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,640
themselves need to follow a trust chain

894
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,880
before they actually publicly announce

895
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,799
things that have a huge impact on a

896
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,919
large number of people and then

897
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,440
eventually be great if that actually

898
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,519
went into the mainstream media as well

899
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,960
so they actually are held accountable

900
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,799
for what they actually say and that they

901
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,440
have to prove that what they've said is

902
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,560
real would some form of trust chain at

903
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:08,960
least

904
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,040
not for the majority of communications

905
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
but for the absolute

906
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,000
core ones start setting um a path

907
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,079
of objectiveness about a claim

908
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,839
yeah but do you really trust your

909
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,760
government no but

910
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,239
that so take for example the rule of law

911
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,760
right if there's actual

912
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,440
if there's an actual um penalty

913
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,079
a a literal legal penalty for being in

914
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,159
breach of that trust chain

915
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,320
you know generally human behavior is

916
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,000
affected by carrot and stick right but

917
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,480
if

918
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,679
a government comes out and makes a

919
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,599
statement any government if you have

920
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,159
that

921
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,800
trust chain that's required of them that

922
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,440
sort of

923
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,560
starts limiting the amount of

924
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
willy-nilly nonsense that they can get

925
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,359
up to right

926
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,800
and then that starts setting the tone

927
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,719
for everyone else

928
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,000
i see where you're coming from um

929
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,480
but just like things like the

930
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,280
international like for example

931
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,200
you know a lot of states take each other

932
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,880
to court and they do this through the

933
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,760
international

934
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,280
criminal court um but

935
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,640
they don't have to turn up to the

936
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,280
hearings if they don't want to go

937
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,200
i think this it's the same thing like

938
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,800
you can you can say someone's done

939
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,920
something

940
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
or you can say that you have done

941
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,119
something

942
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,400
um but you know it comes down to

943
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,640
how much you really trust the word of

944
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,359
mouth really i don't know that you could

945
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,079
actually do

946
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,440
a an application trust chain for

947
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,960
governments and then i don't actually

948
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,640
know how you would keep it accountable

949
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,760
um with the proliferation of um

950
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
these sorts of techniques do you think

951
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,800
that they offer

952
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,400
opportunities for um the reduction of

953
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,839
physical violence in terms of

954
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,560
um these sorts of techniques they

955
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,800
sort of offend our sense of democratic

956
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,920
norms and sort of

957
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,760
our sense of ethics but do you think

958
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,520
that with the increasing efficacy and

959
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,000
how

960
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,200
widely these are being used that they

961
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,359
maybe offer opportunities

962
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,359
for states which do seek to exert a high

963
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,720
degree of control either on their

964
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,640
populations or on others to reduce the

965
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,079
amount of physical violence that they

966
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,440
need to use do you think that there are

967
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,040
any positives in that sense

968
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,160
um i mean one example that springs to

969
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,119
mind

970
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,760
would be china and they've actually set

971
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,359
up like a biometric

972
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,560
you know reward system um to influence

973
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,320
the way that their population behaves

974
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,160
you know you get good points you get bad

975
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
points and then you get told if you're

976
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,839
on the phone with a good person or a bad

977
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,280
person um

978
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,520
and that's actually shaped a lot of

979
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,119
people to

980
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,240
conform to the communist party's

981
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,839
uh ways but i i personally don't see

982
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,160
that

983
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,359
as being positive because it's

984
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,720
it's kind of stifling uh you know

985
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,400
individual wisdom uh it's stifling a bit

986
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,760
of an approach but

987
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,000
i'm sure that with proliferation you can

988
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,640
see positive effects in people

989
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,920
and real world actions but like i

990
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,839
mentioned before as well

991
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,240
you see a lot of it being used to create

992
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,320
one protest and then a lot of it

993
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,079
to create a counter protest at the same

994
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,760
time so the two people

995
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,480
actually and two groups actually erupt

996
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,960
into

997
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,839
civil unrest i hope that answered the

998
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,160
question

999
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,160
oh i loved your

1000
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,880
christmas outfit yeah thanks my dog was

1001
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,000
dressed up the same

1002
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,920
you definitely go hard on christmas

1003
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,720
you know what valid critically

1004
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,079
validating

1005
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,119
information is exhausting i think

1006
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,240
um i think you know at some point you

1007
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,359
end up

1008
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,760
falling prey of you know the um

1009
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,040
media fakes or etc

1010
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,440
cognitive hacking because there is a

1011
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,160
limit to

1012
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,040
what you can you know critically uh

1013
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,760
embrace

1014
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,240
and understand and process and churn etc

1015
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,200
right yeah

1016
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,880
uh but that was not my question so my

1017
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,960
question is because that was gonna be an

1018
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,720
easy one

1019
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,480
now um do you reckon because yeah

1020
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
there i i agree with you in the

1021
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,160
depressing um

1022
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,560
you know uh forecast that there's not

1023
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,800
going to be a lot that we can do

1024
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,920
so far maybe when quantum

1025
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,079
you know computing becomes i don't know

1026
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,040
some

1027
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,599
mega ai algorithm that's going to start

1028
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,359
whatever so anyways

1029
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,119
would it be possible or do you do you

1030
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,359
reckon it is

1031
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,839
we should start thinking like companies

1032
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:46,880
private companies

1033
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,720
and you know well national states

1034
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,640
already do it but in terms of warfare

1035
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,680
um and stand up some so

1036
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,079
like taking seriously taking social

1037
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,839
social media seriously

1038
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,520
in a way that you can counteract

1039
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,640
fake news for example

1040
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
some companies don't believe that having

1041
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,079
a social profile

1042
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,000
it's that relevant maybe they do it just

1043
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,240
because everybody else does it

1044
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,440
but they don't really understand

1045
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,920
the impact that they can have if you

1046
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
have a proper

1047
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,040
if you actually invest in that like your

1048
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,200
marketing department is your war

1049
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,839
department right uh your social media

1050
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,359
communications department

1051
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,320
is like you're waging war out there if

1052
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,800
there is

1053
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,920
fake news uh from a very you know

1054
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,839
high-profile tweeter saying you know

1055
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,000
your company did this and it's terrible

1056
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,200
and blah blah

1057
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,680
and you also have to counteract that you

1058
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,240
have

1059
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,800
a high social media profile that you can

1060
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,680
say

1061
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,040
that is fake news um do you reckon

1062
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,800
companies just start to think in those

1063
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,320
terms to get ready

1064
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,359
you know to create higher social media

1065
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,160
profiles that

1066
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,680
they can unleash out there to

1067
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,200
counteract potential fake news

1068
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,280
so i think if i got that right is it i

1069
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,960
was gonna say based on that question you

1070
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,280
should

1071
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,119
submit a talk next year just the length

1072
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,640
of the question yeah

1073
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,280
it's a it's a huge question though like

1074
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,839
whatever you know

1075
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,440
i don't think it would be i i think

1076
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
you know you can a lot of companies can

1077
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,800
actually piggyback

1078
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,319
off social media platforms too

1079
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,760
and bigger companies if they're being

1080
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,560
victimized um a lot of the time

1081
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,720
you know it'll still be a bot so you'll

1082
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,839
kind of be able to notice it

1083
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,079
um but i mean it's a good point it's a

1084
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:40,800
good point

1085
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,640
uh i i would worry about getting caught

1086
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,839
in

1087
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,560
a creating followers and maybe even

1088
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,400
buying like the company might even start

1089
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,160
buying followers just for the sake

1090
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,280
of arming up an arsenal in case it does

1091
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,400
happen

1092
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,839
because it's basically one piece of

1093
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,920
news media versus another piece of news

1094
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,680
media then and then it's just

1095
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,440
a war of words and people can believe

1096
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,040
who they want um

1097
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,880
so i'm not sure how useful it would be

1098
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,079
for a company to invest in that

1099
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,000
but i'd be interested to listen to your

1100
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,319
talk on it

1101
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,170
