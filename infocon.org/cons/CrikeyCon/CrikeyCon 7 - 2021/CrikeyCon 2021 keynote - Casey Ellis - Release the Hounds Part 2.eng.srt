some of the work that went into putting

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
this together like doing a conference

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
irl like it's safe and we're able to do

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,560
this but it's still a challenge to put

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
it on during a pandemic with all the

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,360
stuff that's going on so

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,000
props to you all um a lot of work went

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,640
in and and

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,840
you know we all get to benefit from it

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,760
so thank you um

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,120
yeah i don't know about you guys but

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,120
i've forgotten how to fly when i was

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,879
when i was back in my bag to come up

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,320
here i'm like hang on does that go on

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,520
the checked or the

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
carry-on i got on the plane and felt

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
like i was doing a good job

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,280
but then all of a sudden i realized i

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
was in the wrong seat

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,280
so clearly i'm not flight fit anymore

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
no no i was i was actually up the back

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
but it was like sir you're in my

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,280
okay fine all good so anyway yeah

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
release the hounds um

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
eight years is a long-ass time that's

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,560
that's the talk uh and as i said it

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,680
feels like a billion years ago and

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,119
yesterday when all this stuff went down

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,479
in terms of the origin story of bug

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,280
crowd

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
but really uh you know what um i want to

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,119
go through today not to preempt

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,280
the setup too much but just to kind of

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,400
talk through

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,360
what it's like building a startup uh in

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,799
this space some of the things that we've

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,920
seen around

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,520
around cyber security and around

46
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,640
particularly crowdsourcing and

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
multi-sourcing the kind of things

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
that we do and we'll go from there so

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
where's this title come from it's an

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,880
early tradition of

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
ours every time we launch a new program

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
we tweet release

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,920
the hounds you see the date there may 15

54
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
2013. and again it feels like yesterday

55
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:44,960
because

56
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
there's been so much that's gone on in

57
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,119
this space um but in reality

58
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,720
like it's a lot of time that's passed

59
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,399
including you know the pandemic which

60
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
felt like about a billion years

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,560
let's keep moving so who am i uh who's

62
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
this dude struggling with laptops and

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
is now selling a mac laptop if anyone's

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,520
interested so my name's casey ellis i'm

65
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
the founder chairman and cto of bug

66
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:07,759
crowd

67
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
also the founder of the disclose io

68
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
project and you know i'm going to be

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,720
hanging out

70
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
outside uh or in the talks for the rest

71
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,319
of the conference so if

72
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,599
anyone wants to come up and talk about

73
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
either of those two things i'm super

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
keen to as are the rest of the team

75
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,000
i've got to ask that question who works

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
for bug crowd here

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,520
all right there's a few more hens this

78
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
time that's cool

79
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,200
so i've been basically in infosec since

80
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
high school i grew up you know tearing

81
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,000
apart technology and messing with it

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
as a kid i think you know that was the

83
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,120
product of

84
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
of an environment where i had a lot of

85
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
tech to play with my old band was a

86
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
science teacher

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
um but the other thing was that um yeah

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
i always and

89
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,720
many of you i think will relate to this

90
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,160
i always really enjoyed thinking like a

91
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,280
criminal that had

92
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
absolutely no desire to be one so there

93
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
was this kind of spark going on it's

94
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,239
like i don't want to like hurt people

95
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,680
and stuff but that that's really cool

96
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
and i really like thinking

97
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
you know outside the box um and really

98
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
to get into the security industry as a

99
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
job discovering that this was possible

100
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,640
in the first place that was like

101
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,440
christmas

102
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
for me and i'm sure that experience was

103
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,400
similar for a lot of you all it's like i

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,720
can do this and be legit this is awesome

105
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,440
uh so yeah we pioneered effectively the

106
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,760
crowd source security as a service model

107
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
um we didn't invent vulnerability

108
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,120
disclosure we didn't invent bug bounty

109
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,519
that's a

110
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,800
that's a whole other long kind of

111
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
history conversation uh but when it came

112
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,080
to actually

113
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,720
you know basically doing this as a as a

114
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,360
platform

115
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,200
uh we were the first ones to do it and

116
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
you know things have kind of escalated

117
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,239
since then so this talk is

118
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,159
is partly about that i'm a proud aussie

119
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,760
husband my wife is kicking around

120
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,720
somewhere

121
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,080
um father of two and uh lives in

122
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,480
i don't know where somewhere um we've

123
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
been living in san francisco for the

124
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,080
past eight years we actually bugged out

125
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,319
almost a year to the day flew out on the

126
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,000
13th of march

127
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,680
basically seeing covert coming over the

128
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
hill in america and that combined with

129
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
um having worked on elections and seeing

130
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,120
how

131
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,799
volatile that whole situation was it's

132
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,400
like it's going to be a rough year so

133
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
let's get to where we're close to family

134
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,599
and get the kids into a better

135
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,480
environment

136
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
hopefully we'll get back there but

137
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
that's basically a work in progress

138
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,680
at this point as is true i think for a

139
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
lot of people it's a first world problem

140
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
but it's still been a pretty interesting

141
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
12 months that's for sure

142
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,279
so what are we talking about um been

143
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
through this what have we talked what

144
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,040
have we

145
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
been through or what have we been up to

146
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,639
as an organization

147
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,800
what have we seen the industry do where

148
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
is crowdsourcing and multi-sourcing up

149
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,360
to now

150
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
what comes next this is really a

151
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,960
two-pronged talk i think

152
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
what i want to do is to inform security

153
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
folks but then also try to appeal

154
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,880
to the entrepreneurs in the room right

155
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,840
um

156
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,120
you know tell my story help you guys

157
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
understand by crowd in our space but

158
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,360
then

159
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
you know hopefully inspire some folks

160
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,639
that are here to step out

161
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,560
the reason for doing that i've been like

162
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
literally walking sand hill road for the

163
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,960
past eight years

164
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
alongside building the company and

165
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
australians are really really good at

166
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,280
this

167
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
um but we're really terrible at

168
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,720
realizing that

169
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,199
right like as a as a culture and as a

170
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
nation i actually think that we're

171
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,199
almost uniquely talented when it comes

172
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,400
to troubleshooting and coming up with

173
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,600
cool solutions

174
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
but we also kind of suck at sales

175
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
because we don't like to self-promote

176
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,639
you know we don't like to necessarily

177
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,320
overestimate ourselves

178
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
um and kind of do ourselves out of out

179
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
of the process i think

180
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
uh as a result so hopefully some of the

181
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,039
story i'm not that smart

182
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
um honestly i just had to go and saw a

183
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,880
thing saw an opportunity went for it got

184
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
a bunch of smart people around

185
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
me to help build it and and it's kind of

186
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,039
worked out so

187
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,639
you can do that too it's really the

188
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,360
point that i'm trying to drive out there

189
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,759
all right so back to this talk in in in

190
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,720
uh the 1st of march 2013

191
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
um some of the slides it's actually a

192
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
fun one to go through and it was sort of

193
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,919
when i started talking to the crikey

194
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
guys about um

195
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
speaking here i went back and had a look

196
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,560
at it because there's a lot of things

197
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
that are different

198
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,840
and a lot of things that are still the

199
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,560
same

200
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
for example the moment you launch a

201
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
bounty program you get a billion people

202
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,479
telling you about dmarc and click

203
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,440
checking

204
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,319
that is still a thing um and it's not

205
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,600
because

206
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
there is a lack of skill in the space i

207
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,639
think it's because the number of

208
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,919
participants

209
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,600
who are on that kind of learning process

210
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,039
and the ease of being able to identify

211
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,240
that type of vulnerability they just

212
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,440
think it's the right thing to do so

213
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,160
they'll do that

214
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
part of what bugred does is filters that

215
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
out and actually trains them on how to

216
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
be better but that's very much still a

217
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,000
thing

218
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
and you can see here 10 bounties we

219
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,039
actually ran some charity bounties early

220
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:23,440
on

221
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
um there was some some not-for-profits

222
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,039
that came to us and said hey

223
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,800
uh we we need security i'm like well

224
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,639
what can you pay the community

225
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,960
nothing we're a charity like okay let's

226
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,160
see if that works

227
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
um and the coolest story out of that was

228
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,160
a uh

229
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,000
basically an organization that raised

230
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
money to combat sex trafficking in

231
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
southeast asia we kind of teased out

232
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
what the mission was and got people set

233
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
up for it then launched it and we

234
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
literally knocked them off the internet

235
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,720
for for like a day and a half because of

236
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,319
the response

237
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,680
we then learned how not to do that

238
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
because obviously that's not something

239
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,319
that you want to do if you're a security

240
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,120
company but

241
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,680
to me what that did early on was to

242
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,120
speak to

243
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,520
i think a lot of the misconceptions that

244
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,400
the market had

245
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,919
and just the general public had around

246
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
hackers like we're not

247
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,440
bad people necessarily some of us are um

248
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,919
but to have an intrigue to have a skill

249
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,280
to have a career in the space doesn't

250
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,680
mean

251
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,120
you're someone to actually be afraid of

252
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
we're here to help right so that was

253
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,240
pretty cool

254
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,160
um you know general observations from

255
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,599
that deck this is again

256
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,479
uh what this is eight years ago now

257
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,360
actually just passed

258
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,440
it's working that turned out to be

259
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
pretty accurate

260
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
um running an accelerated startup is

261
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
wicked hard work this is before we'd

262
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,520
gone to silicon valley for the first

263
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,199
time so we'd raised a fifty thousand

264
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,919
dollar

265
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,520
what i refer to as the raman noodle

266
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,599
round out of out of start mate

267
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,319
um and and that basically paid for

268
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
flights and accommodation in sf

269
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
and about three beers because it's kind

270
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
of expensive over there

271
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
um but that was kind of the yeah the

272
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
jump start for us and we were just about

273
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
to fly over

274
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,759
um here's where you know the

275
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,039
actually my office where i started

276
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,800
working on it myself and then

277
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
the first place that we landed on in sf

278
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,319
um this is the platform in what is this

279
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,039
2012 december 2012 so this is actually a

280
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,000
a

281
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
kickoff labs form that was meant for for

282
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,080
people to sign up on

283
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,639
um the early proof that this was going

284
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,440
to work

285
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,039
was was really when i sent out a couple

286
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,080
of tweets and said hey we're going to

287
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,440
try this thing if you want to

288
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,599
hack on some cool stuff go sign up and

289
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,479
it just

290
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,759
it blew up um you know in in

291
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,919
the terms of of that particular period

292
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,200
of time we had about 4

293
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
000 people sign up over the next you

294
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
know two weeks or so

295
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,279
so to me that proved that you know the

296
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,159
supply side

297
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,279
and the people that are actually going

298
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
to do this are there and they're willing

299
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,399
it's just a matter of plugging them in

300
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
right

301
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
and this is the first program uh this

302
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
was actually a shitty rails app that i

303
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,399
built

304
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,760
and i'm like all right i want to wonder

305
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
if this works so i basically got 500

306
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
bucks put it out there

307
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,120
divvied up the reward so i wouldn't go

308
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
over the 500

309
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,640
amount and that's that was actually the

310
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,600
origin of our crowdsource pen test

311
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
pricing model because if you've got a

312
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,959
capped cost you can't necessarily what

313
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,080
if you get a million bucks you've got to

314
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
be able to answer that question so

315
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
this is where that got started and uh it

316
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
worked it was incredible i think

317
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,839
you know the the bitter proof problem

318
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,440
solution fit proof that came out of that

319
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
was seeing

320
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,600
um someone basically inject

321
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,800
a payload through the twitter shortener

322
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
into the back end that then rendered on

323
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
a unlisted page

324
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
together on mouseover xss i think it was

325
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,680
something like that

326
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,519
so it's like not you know the end of the

327
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,959
world but that's some pretty creative

328
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,320
stuff going on right there and to be

329
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
able to see that full out because that

330
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,279
particular person was good at that

331
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,560
particular thing

332
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
it's like okay this is this works this

333
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
is cool

334
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,200
um i think the other thing is that

335
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
you know 2012 which is when this is all

336
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,399
going down

337
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,680
uh it was a it was a simpler time wasn't

338
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,240
it

339
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
i think it's before people i'm actually

340
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
going to talk about the journey to

341
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
hackers becoming relevant cyber security

342
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,399
becoming dinner table conversation

343
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,560
this to me feels like it was before that

344
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,839
so we're all just kind of spawning

345
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,360
around doing our thing

346
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
um you know trying to figure out how to

347
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
make money and pay the bills and do all

348
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,920
that kind of stuff but

349
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,519
i think there was a lot less

350
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
of a business imperative on what we do

351
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,480
then compared to now and you know

352
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
frankly that was those nice things about

353
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,440
that there's obviously opportunity

354
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
that's come

355
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,320
since which is pretty awesome as well um

356
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,399
so you know rip good times but

357
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,200
um i remember them fondly and really

358
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,399
this is the idea

359
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
behind i think vulnerability disclosure

360
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,240
and it's not actually just us so when

361
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
i'm talking about this stuff there's

362
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
part of it's what bug crowd does and how

363
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
we do our thing part of it's just the

364
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,959
space at this point in time there's i

365
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,480
think 45

366
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,720
different platforms doing you know

367
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,160
baking a cake was roughly the same

368
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,480
ingredients as how i frame it um

369
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
around the world and that's because this

370
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
just makes sense

371
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,480
uh as an organization if you've got you

372
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,120
know

373
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,200
an attack surface to defend and

374
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,560
ultimately you're tasked with being

375
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,079
smarter with all the adversaries that

376
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:00,720
might come

377
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
come and bother you and you're relying

378
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,720
on single individuals it doesn't

379
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
necessarily matter how good or bad

380
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
those individuals are they're

381
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
fundamentally disadvantaged because of

382
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
the math

383
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
so okay in the meantime you've got the

384
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
white hat community sitting there

385
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,320
wanting to help

386
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
and there's this latent potential

387
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
disconnected with this unmet demand

388
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,399
like really that was kind of the origin

389
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,079
of the idea the other thing was to try

390
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:22,480
to get

391
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
you know stop people from going to jail

392
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,839
basically

393
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,200
it's like looking at a lot of the work

394
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,760
we did with disclosures around

395
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,720
just you know policy advocacy um we're a

396
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,240
part of writing the policies that we

397
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,880
used

398
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,079
uh to secure aspects of the

399
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,320
2020 general election in the u.s which

400
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
kind of worked i guess um

401
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,160
that was a joke um

402
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,519
but you know seeing that ahead and like

403
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,040
packers want to help out with this stuff

404
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,000
it's going to actually

405
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,560
you know do do a part to instill

406
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
confidence in the american population

407
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,600
because the integrity of this election

408
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
is going to come under attack this is

409
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,079
two years before

410
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
um all the crazy ship went down in

411
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
october so

412
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
um and and after that as well so those

413
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,959
are the things that

414
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,440
you know we've really invested in and

415
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
gotten into as an organization

416
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
so all right that's the origin stuff

417
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,040
nick minute

418
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,200
um one of the funny things that happened

419
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,279
when i landed in sf sitting with a with

420
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,680
a lyft driver who was sydney's

421
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,360
he immigrated to the us and we're

422
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,800
talking about security because

423
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,320
that just tends to happen when i ride on

424
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,639
a lift with people um

425
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,560
and he trotted out this amazing quote

426
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
like all security is the product of

427
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
something bad happening

428
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
which i think you know as a mental model

429
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,680
and a framework to think about in terms

430
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,040
of what we do is actually

431
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,279
pretty useful um you know folks aren't

432
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,240
doing secure

433
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
security poorly because they they don't

434
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
care or they don't want to

435
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,959
half the time it's because they're so

436
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,560
focused on the thing they're trying to

437
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,279
do

438
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,959
that it just gets pushed to the wayside

439
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,279
so that was kind of interesting i got to

440
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,639
thinking about that

441
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,320
in terms of the market and the same

442
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
months that we landed in the u.s

443
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,920
that happened um i promise i had nothing

444
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,959
to do with it that's the

445
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,279
the caveat that i have to often give in

446
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,959
the u.s because um

447
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
you know snowden not to speak about any

448
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,399
of the

449
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,040
uh input or output of what he did but

450
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,839
what i do

451
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,920
think happened as a product of this is

452
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
that the general population saw it

453
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,760
and all of a sudden rip good times it's

454
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,600
like hacking happens to me this is the

455
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
thing that i actually

456
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,959
you know need to have at least in some

457
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,639
way on my radar now i

458
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,680
still don't really understand what's

459
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,399
going on but i know it is actually

460
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
starting to affect me personally

461
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,240
and it kind of escalated from there so

462
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
in 2014 that was the year

463
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
of the uh the year of the credit card

464
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,760
breach particularly in the us but it

465
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,880
happened right around the world i think

466
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,600
as emv

467
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
and chip and pin were starting to roll

468
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,199
out um some of the some of the

469
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,199
gangs just kind of did their last hurrah

470
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,560
on um on

471
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
track two and dumps and different things

472
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
like that so target got popped all the

473
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,959
retails so now hacking happens to me

474
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,279
personally it's not just it happens

475
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,199
which is what snowden taught people

476
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,480
it's like now it's now it's me

477
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,519
and then this happened um this actually

478
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
happened in the same year as the opm

479
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,760
breach um and there were some others as

480
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
well that were basically uninsurable

481
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,399
right so this clearly isn't you know

482
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,440
difficult to

483
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,040
insure yourself against if you happen to

484
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,720
get caught up in ashley madison

485
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,760
opm was was basically clearance data

486
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,360
and records that were getting correlated

487
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
with flight records and different things

488
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,760
like that

489
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,720
so now it's hacking happens to me and it

490
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,360
hurts

491
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,199
um my my credit card company company's

492
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,560
not going to pay me back for that one so

493
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,599
this is starting to suck

494
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,800
then this happened 2016 you know hackers

495
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
are hacking

496
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,880
hacking happens to my country that i

497
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,600
think was

498
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
and by the way this is my observation

499
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,240
that's quite north america-centric

500
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
because that's where we were for all of

501
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
this

502
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
um but i do think you know there's

503
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
there's some pretty broad analogs that

504
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
happen right across the west

505
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,320
over the same time frame 27 to 2020 all

506
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
right cool software's eating the world

507
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,519
and and the bad guys are eating the

508
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,279
software um

509
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,240
and here we are in 2020 uh actually in

510
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,199
2020 coming out of that into 2021

511
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,639
my employees five-year-old is

512
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,079
responsible for my corporate attack

513
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,800
service that's new

514
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
and actually a really interesting you

515
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,839
know for the folks that are

516
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,120
that are thinking about this problem i

517
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
think there's a lot of scope i don't

518
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
think work from home is is gonna

519
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,519
go away um and i don't think we've

520
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,399
really thought through

521
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,440
what the impact of a home network is on

522
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
on corporate security uh to the extent

523
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,880
that we think we have

524
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,480
um and part of the evidence of that is

525
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,000
the fact that like iot

526
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
and and router oday is now flying off

527
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,000
the shelf

528
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,240
um whereas before this it basically sat

529
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,680
there because it wasn't as interesting

530
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
so the adversary is

531
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
clued into this which means it's going

532
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
to occupy us

533
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
at some point in the future as well and

534
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,000
this is really the idea if it's repeated

535
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,279
enough times in the dinner table it

536
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
actually makes its way to the boardroom

537
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,680
um so it's not just about hey like ciso

538
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,959
guy or

539
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,959
or person you know ceo person like

540
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,040
security matters if they're hearing

541
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,320
about it from their kids

542
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
or from their spouse or from their

543
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,519
family then all of a sudden it's top of

544
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,320
mind

545
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
i think that's actually driven like

546
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
we're in a pretty unique position

547
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,759
now i feel like when we started bug

548
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,759
crowd you had to scream from the street

549
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,560
corner

550
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
to try to get you know two or three

551
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
people to listen and pay attention to

552
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
what you're talking about

553
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,680
now they're coming to us which is pretty

554
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,120
interesting and i think that's relevant

555
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,079
not just for

556
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,519
for us and our space i think it's

557
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,759
relevant for everyone in this room

558
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,560
so what we up to um this is the first

559
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,040
office

560
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,440
in in sf which is cool i love that photo

561
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,560
it was just

562
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
that was like early on it was it just

563
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
felt good

564
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,040
um second office in ministry this is as

565
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,720
we're growing

566
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
uh third sorry that was the second

567
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
that i showed then the third this is the

568
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,639
fourth on front street which is where we

569
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,959
are now it's it's abandoned and all the

570
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,399
plants are dead but we'll eventually get

571
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
back there

572
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,199
um we've got an office in sydney

573
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
australia as well and and other places

574
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
around the world

575
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
basically where we're at is a 198

576
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,480
employees uh 80 million raised 257

577
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,599
194 vulnerabilities nuked

578
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,160
just about to tip over 50 million u.s

579
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,480
paid out to the supply side

580
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
about 250 000 people signed up on the

581
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,760
platform

582
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,880
they're not like we don't have an army

583
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,720
of 250 000 people there's a difference

584
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,160
between someone who signs up and someone

585
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,839
who actually does stuff so i'm calling

586
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,120
out that distinction but

587
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,400
because these big numbers get thrown

588
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
around i wanted to add it in

589
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,280
and you know 480 customers uh

590
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
which have really you know focused on

591
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,840
how do we take this idea of

592
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
hackers and cyber security people being

593
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,160
useful and having a constructive input

594
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
into into you know the entire market not

595
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,360
just

596
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
like the nerds at facebook and google

597
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
where this all kicked off right that was

598
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
really our initial objective was to jump

599
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,760
out of the

600
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
i call it the um you know the lunatics

601
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,760
validating the asylum

602
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
in san francisco right like there's this

603
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
kind of sandpit thing where you can

604
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
prove stuff but it doesn't necessarily

605
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,160
validate the relevance of it to the

606
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,840
broader market so we did that

607
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,960
you know working with department of

608
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,679
defense working with you know dhs

609
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,799
national australia bank here in

610
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,080
australia a whole bunch of others so

611
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,120
it's it's kind of

612
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,400
broken out to the point where it's

613
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160
mainstream and that's pretty cool i'm

614
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
not going to go too far into this but

615
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,600
yeah i think one of the things that i

616
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,280
spend a decent amount of time talking

617
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,160
about right now

618
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160
is that it's not just bug bounty or vdp

619
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
um you know going back to the the tug of

620
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,520
war thing

621
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,320
it's actually about basically connecting

622
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,919
people with questions to the folks that

623
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:34,799
can answer them

624
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,919
uh in whatever context the the the

625
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,919
concept of a bug bounty program got a

626
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,160
tailwind uh in about

627
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,480
early 2015 when hector pentagon started

628
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,919
up and all of a sudden it was sexy and

629
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,120
we were spending a lot of time just

630
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
trying to ride that wind

631
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,799
but what it also did was i think kind of

632
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,400
included the fact that

633
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,320
no there's you know pen test opportunity

634
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,080
in this there's a whole bunch of other

635
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
stuff that you can do

636
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
with a group of smart hackers if you can

637
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
connect what you need done to the right

638
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
person to actually do that work and

639
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,200
that's really what

640
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
what we're building and what we've built

641
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,559
as an organization this is kind of

642
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,760
some of the stuff that we do so i'll put

643
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
this stuff online i don't want to turn

644
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
this into a pitch so i'm not gonna

645
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
i'm not gonna drop down too far into

646
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
into this stuff right now

647
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
um i think the other part of it and this

648
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,240
is going back to the

649
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,480
you know the the folks that are

650
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
straining to like

651
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,559
change stuff if you got an idea you've

652
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
got this sense of

653
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
wanting to pursue greater potential in

654
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
this space maybe do a start-up maybe it

655
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,720
could be

656
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,799
you know a range of other things we've

657
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,240
gotten to do some pretty amazing stuff

658
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,600
like i mentioned the election thing

659
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,160
before

660
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,000
um working with hack the pentagon like

661
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
training people

662
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,840
how to have a productive career in cyber

663
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,720
security

664
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,640
um one of my favorites is is literally

665
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,840
diverting

666
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,720
you know young people that have like an

667
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
ability that's actually outpaced the

668
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,400
growth of their moral compass and and

669
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,840
kind of diverting them from what would

670
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
probably turn into a life of crime

671
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,480
um because that's a thing right you get

672
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
a 15 year old who does something stupid

673
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
they're not trying to be a bad guy they

674
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,000
just

675
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
do their thing and all of a sudden they

676
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,280
get dinged for it and

677
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,480
and it sets them off down the wrong

678
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
track so getting to kind of divert that

679
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,600
i think is a pretty

680
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,919
pretty interesting aspect of all of this

681
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,960
yeah thank you

682
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
and honestly we're all a part of that

683
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,600
because i think the cyber security

684
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,159
industry

685
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,760
that's not just an opportunity for bug

686
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,039
crowd i think that's an opportunity for

687
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,080
all of us

688
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,520
because of the stuff i just talked about

689
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
we're dinner table conversation now

690
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,120
so training's pretty pretty key um

691
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,679
oh and also we have an advanced services

692
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,280
group in in australia

693
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,400
and in case you haven't heard we're

694
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,679
hiring so i'm going to move on from that

695
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,720
one too

696
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,280
um so we'll get to conclusion stuff how

697
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,400
long have i got because i'm

698
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,520
a little off 15 okay cool

699
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
i've got got thrown with the the front

700
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,840
bit a little bit there that's all good

701
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
um so really my observation in terms of

702
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,559
talking to

703
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,799
you know now that we're i think in a

704
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
better position to say what a cso

705
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,000
actually is and what they do

706
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
i i think we're still in the position

707
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,159
where csos in 2021 are a little bit like

708
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,080
cios in like 2005

709
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,039
it's the nerd in the boardroom that

710
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,559
doesn't quite know why they're there and

711
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,000
the other people don't quite know

712
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
why they're there and we're still going

713
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,039
through that journey of basically

714
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,320
establishing a common language that's

715
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,679
not anyone's fault by the way it's

716
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,799
because it's new

717
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,600
um but you know how does how does

718
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
security

719
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,039
you know deliver value back into a

720
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,480
business in a way that the business

721
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,200
understands

722
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,520
so elevating the conversation just from

723
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
vulnerabilities and hacks and breaches

724
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,400
and all these different things to say

725
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,080
okay how does this fit into risk like

726
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
how do i think about this in terms of

727
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,960
differentiating myself to make my

728
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,720
customer feel safer so i can sell more

729
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,840
stuff

730
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
there's all these different things that

731
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,400
the business is actually starting to

732
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,200
look at

733
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,360
right across the board that are also

734
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,720
pretty new i think prior

735
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
to um you know 2017 like risk-based

736
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
security was this thing the cool kids

737
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,039
talked about

738
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,320
and then i noticed literally at the

739
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,200
gartner conference in dc um

740
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
it shifted pretty quickly mostly because

741
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
i think people in in management

742
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
kind of came to this acceptance that i'm

743
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,679
not going to fix all this

744
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
like there's so much to do and there's

745
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,840
such a continuous evolution of things

746
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,320
that

747
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,799
that need to be you know protected

748
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
detected or responded to

749
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
that unless i prioritize and think about

750
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
it in context of the business value of

751
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,600
doing those things i'm actually not

752
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
going to get around to all of it so

753
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,000
that's not going to work

754
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,559
um and that to me is is really the trend

755
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,480
in terms of the overall

756
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,679
you know thinking that the market's

757
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,280
taking an opportunity for us right the

758
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,720
better we can explain ourselves to

759
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,919
people the better we can

760
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,600
actually help them do their thing and

761
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
turn this into a partnership between

762
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
builders and breakers like ultimately

763
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,559
that to me is the end game

764
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,159
of stuff like bug crowd it's not about

765
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,600
just finding bugs and

766
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,120
you know kicking people down the stairs

767
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
and having a bit of a laugh it's

768
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,520
actually about

769
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
helping them think a little bit more the

770
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,720
way that we do

771
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,799
and vice versa so that we can think more

772
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,480
about their priorities and start to

773
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,760
give them feedback more intelligently

774
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,679
you know as a cso it's it's the the

775
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,360
financial risk side it's the political

776
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
risk side and that goes to

777
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,080
being able to talk about what you're

778
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,760
doing around security to the market but

779
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,039
internally as well

780
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,400
and then there's obviously the technical

781
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,720
piece which we mostly focus on

782
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
um what that means for us is that you

783
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,000
know humility empathy

784
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,240
and skill are really the preeminent

785
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,760
qualities that are actually going to

786
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,679
not just i think this is not just for

787
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,039
the sake of being a good human in the

788
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,480
space i think this is actually really

789
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,280
valuable

790
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
in terms of how you kind of elevate what

791
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,720
you're doing elevate your ability to

792
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,600
give input

793
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,039
and if you're an entrepreneur elevate

794
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,480
your ability to create something that's

795
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:24,960
actually

796
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,760
incredible and powerful right so i'm

797
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,280
going to pause for water for a sec here

798
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,840
so let's talk about some other

799
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
observations

800
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,279
so 2015 was like peak crazy

801
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,440
for venture in in in silicon valley it's

802
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
like when all the vcs suddenly realized

803
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
oh people are getting hacked we should

804
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,840
put some money into this

805
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,679
um and you know ai is a replacement for

806
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,039
humans forever

807
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,320
people will sell on that type of thing

808
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,279
it doesn't work like that um

809
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,799
to begin with and they've since realized

810
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,120
that but i think what it did was have

811
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,600
this

812
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,880
leave this lasting impression that

813
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,799
that's possible so those kind of

814
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,400
pictures still work i think the broke

815
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
way of thinking is that

816
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,440
technology is going to make all this go

817
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,799
away i just need to spend enough money

818
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,799
on it and it'll be fine

819
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,720
the worker way of thinking about it is

820
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,080
that it's a people problem

821
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,360
you know to me like security people

822
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,559
making mistakes that create

823
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,880
vulnerabilities predates the internet by

824
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,480
a couple of thousand years right

825
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
like we didn't invent that idea um and

826
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,320
then people taking advantage of that is

827
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,080
also a pretty old concept so

828
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,360
really what's happened is we've just

829
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,880
accelerated it with tech and that's how

830
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
we think about it

831
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,279
um broke vdp is a marketing stunt so the

832
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,159
whole idea of

833
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,360
hey techcrunch i'm launching a

834
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,799
vulnerability disclosure program aren't

835
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,640
i awesome

836
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,320
it's good like i think there's a there's

837
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,840
a genuine benefit in being able to make

838
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,760
that statement to the public but

839
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
i think the more powerful thing that

840
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,799
happens is when you go out and say you

841
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,760
know what

842
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,559
we're not perfect um and guess what no

843
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,760
one is

844
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,000
we see that every single day like even

845
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,080
the most you know the the organizations

846
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,679
you perceive as the most secure

847
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
aren't because qed like people make

848
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,120
mistakes right

849
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,480
i think that statement is actually a

850
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,600
really powerful thing for the

851
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,880
organization to get its arms around

852
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,080
because all of a sudden you can

853
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,400
improve because you're not so busy you

854
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,159
know doing ostrich risk management and

855
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,520
trying to pretend it's all not there

856
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,679
right

857
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,279
bro bug band is silver bullet work bug

858
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,640
bounty is a way to

859
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
internalize the boogeyman is real within

860
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,840
the organization so if a

861
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,559
if an engineering team is is learning

862
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,080
about how the code's been broken

863
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,200
by some kid halfway across the world all

864
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
of a sudden

865
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,919
you know they're starting to think about

866
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,840
their next door neighbor and and and

867
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
what you know gangs might operate

868
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
in their neighborhood and all our stuff

869
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,720
there's a different

870
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,320
impact i think to seeing stuff coming

871
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,000
from the outside world to even

872
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,240
you know internal work even though

873
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
internal work is incredibly powerful and

874
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:50,720
important i'm not

875
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
denigrating it there's just a different

876
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,760
thing that you activate when it comes in

877
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,039
from the outside and if you attach a

878
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,200
price to that all of a sudden it becomes

879
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
quantifiable so that's pretty cool total

880
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,679
payouts is a vanity metric like this is

881
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,880
literally broke

882
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,039
so you see people that want your bug

883
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,400
value program and it's all about how

884
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
much they can pay out

885
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,159
there's upside to that because you

886
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,840
engage more people uh because

887
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,960
because folk want to get paid the

888
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,559
downside to it is it doesn't really say

889
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,559
good things about your security program

890
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,640
um and it doesn't necessarily encourage

891
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,080
the right behavior like you want to be

892
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,360
paying the right amount

893
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520
to break into your stuff and this is how

894
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,200
i think about it you know

895
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,760
hopefully in a more work way it becomes

896
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,960
a proxy cost

897
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,919
for for you know how much it like how

898
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,440
much money does it cost to incentivize

899
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,960
someone to break into my business and be

900
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,080
successful

901
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,520
if you can chart that over time all of a

902
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,720
sudden you've got a metric you can use

903
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,840
in the boardroom

904
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,440
um and it has a dollar sign so they'll

905
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
actually read it which is good boards

906
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,679
are

907
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,520
tough um pentest is an assurance-only

908
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,240
model

909
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,159
i think you know where i've seen this

910
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,760
move this is in our context but i think

911
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,640
i've seen it

912
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,240
talking to a lot of pentest firms and

913
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,480
other people in in that industry

914
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,640
um you know assurance and impact so

915
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,840
thinking about it less is

916
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,679
as a compliance activity or something

917
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,960
that you know

918
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
is primarily focused on making sure you

919
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
checked all the things it's like no i

920
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,440
want to actually

921
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,520
use this as a tool to assess my overall

922
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,200
risk as an organization

923
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
factoring in the interdependencies i

924
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,760
have factoring in the fact that you know

925
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,360
some bugs are harder to find than others

926
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,039
some kill chains take a bit more effort

927
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,720
to discover and require different ways

928
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,760
of thinking

929
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,440
than someone that's just running through

930
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,600
them through a list like what i'm seeing

931
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,080
from the market is a real leaning in to

932
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,440
wanting to see that output that's always

933
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,240
been kind of true

934
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,399
in the pentest industry i think but i

935
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,919
also do feel like there's players that

936
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,440
have come in and diluted it

937
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,880
and just turned it into this like

938
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,559
checkbox business activity like we can

939
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,520
do better than that

940
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,360
i think and i think there's an appetite

941
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,640
starting to form for that which is

942
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,840
pretty cool

943
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,360
and that creates those feedback loops i

944
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,440
was talking about before

945
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
this is a new entrant china wouldn't

946
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
bother with my staff uh

947
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,080
or russia or whoever else i think to me

948
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,600
like i'm not going to talk about supply

949
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
chain attacks because everyone's doing

950
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,240
that

951
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,880
um but the thing that uh the solarwinds

952
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,520
breach um i think demonstrated to folk

953
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,120
was like that's a nation state and they

954
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,480
came after me

955
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,360
um if you're threat modeling in a way

956
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,760
that

957
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,200
just assumes that you're not going to be

958
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,960
interesting enough to an actor like that

959
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,480
i think it kind of proved that that's

960
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,159
not entirely true

961
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,640
um so you know work is how do i detect

962
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,520
and contain

963
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,120
a nation state assuming they're

964
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
successful so building it like it's

965
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,080
broken

966
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,679
uh and then broke you know coming back

967
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,279
to the vdp piece like security at

968
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,520
domain.com to devnol

969
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,120
the folks that have tried to report

970
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,399
vulnerabilities that's why i was asking

971
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,360
that before

972
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,799
have probably experienced this half the

973
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,000
time it's like shouting into a black

974
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,120
hole because people

975
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
either aren't listening or don't know

976
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,480
how to respond

977
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,600
you know what we've tried to do with

978
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,679
disclose io is to basically simplify

979
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,559
that

980
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,960
in terms of standardization of policy

981
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,919
language

982
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,520
um creating safe harbor to make sure

983
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,640
that you know no one feels like they're

984
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,600
going to go to jail

985
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
but also that the organization feels

986
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,440
like they're not inviting bad guys to do

987
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,039
bad things or bad people to do bad

988
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,640
things as a part of putting that policy

989
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,279
up

990
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,960
um we've got a bunch of other stuff this

991
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,880
is an open source project uh

992
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,279
it's actually it started with bug crowd

993
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,960
um we had a version of it that then

994
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,600
merged with version out of the berkeley

995
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,000
uh

996
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,799
uc and it's basically rebranded so we

997
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,080
can push it all forward so

998
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,600
if you're interested to talk about that

999
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,520
um i'm pretty passionate about this i

1000
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,240
want to see it

1001
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,919
work because i want to see this become

1002
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,240
normal for our input just to be like not

1003
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,600
even offensive anymore it's just like

1004
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,960
yeah okay cool here's the thing i need

1005
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,200
to fix that's awesome like let's work

1006
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,679
together to make the internet better

1007
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,120
so in summary good things happen when

1008
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
you step out um

1009
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,600
you know i i think that's the uh and uh

1010
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,240
chris

1011
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,399
give us wife co-founder back there

1012
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,039
thanks dude um some of the other folk in

1013
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,240
the room like

1014
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,399
you know you take a risk it's a measured

1015
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,000
risk you're in security like the worst

1016
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
case scenario is you

1017
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,360
come back and get some sort of role that

1018
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,120
you're not a massive fan of

1019
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
probably land that pretty easily and

1020
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,440
then figure out what you're going to do

1021
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,399
from there so

1022
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,240
there's risk that's available for you to

1023
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,840
fall back into

1024
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,200
if you want to step out and start to

1025
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
work on some stuff and again come chat

1026
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,399
to me about that because i always get

1027
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,840
jazzed up

1028
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,600
our industry is only only just getting

1029
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
started uh and i do think you know

1030
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,399
aussies kick ass

1031
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,279
at this stuff hence go forward and be

1032
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,159
rad

1033
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,159
um grace hopper t-shirt we've got uh

1034
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,919
we've got a bunch of stickers

1035
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,039
uh around as well um because we

1036
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,279
accidentally created a swag company

1037
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,039
that sort of dabbles in cyber security i

1038
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,480
don't know what happened we do like swag

1039
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,159
parties and kind of hack some stuff on

1040
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:30,960
the side

1041
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,279
um but there's a bunch of bug crowders

1042
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,720
around you know come up grab one say

1043
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
hello do all that sort of stuff

1044
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,320
and uh you know really we're here to you

1045
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,880
know i'm here today to to basically

1046
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960

1047
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,720

to the degree that you guys can um you

1049
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,000
know get something useful from my

1050
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
experience i'm happy to share it so

1051

feel free to come say hi and that is the

1052
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,970
end of my talk

1053
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,550
[Applause]

1054
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,500
[Music]

1055
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:03,600
[Applause]

1056
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,360
hey casey that was great thank you very

1057
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,519
much for keynoting us today

1058
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,600
one of the questions i had around it is

1059
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,039
you've kind of gone from the

1060
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,679
you know crowdsourcing pen testing

1061
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,480
approach

1062
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
what does it look like from uh or have

1063
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,919
you had thoughts around crowdsourcing

1064
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,519
like a defense approach

1065
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,679
yeah um so we've actually we've

1066
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,279
experimented with this the prior art

1067
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,960
around this is the defensive mitigation

1068
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,880
program that's uh katy moe did

1069
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,679
uh at microsoft actually quite a while

1070
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,279
back now

1071
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,279
the challenge with defense is that it's

1072
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,039
more difficult to have context on

1073
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,240
regression

1074
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
uh so so coming in and saying here's how

1075
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,519
you fix fix a bunch of stuff as someone

1076
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,960
who's coming in from the outside

1077
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,480
you know you can have a pretty good idea

1078
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,399
of what's going on under the hood but

1079
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,080
not necessarily a complete one

1080
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,679
but yeah i think you know it's something

1081
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,880
that we've been working on in terms of

1082
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,840
crowdsourcing

1083
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
for example the generation of waff rules

1084
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,919
um you know talking to people about

1085
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,360
recommendations we have an

1086
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,440
open source recommendation

1087
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,039
library basically that maps to the

1088
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,640
vulnerability rating taxonomy that's

1089
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,360
kind of

1090
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
so that's sort of crowdsourced as well

1091
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,480
in a way um

1092
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,320
it's a it's a good question i think you

1093
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,480
know where i see offense is a really

1094
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,159
logical place to apply this model

1095
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:12,880
because

1096
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,240
it's kind of all care and no

1097
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,080
responsibility in a way which

1098
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,000
which does you know lend itself to being

1099
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
able to distribute

1100
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
and to be able to throw you know a piece

1101
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,799
of information over the fence for people

1102
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
to then go off and use

1103
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,600
the big thing is that you can't just

1104
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,760
stop there because if an organization's

1105
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,200
taking that and it's not of value to

1106
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,960
them and you have to extend that so

1107
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,320
yeah it's a long answer to a short

1108
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,000
question but hopefully

1109
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,480
got there so continuing that theme and

1110
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,080
i'm just asking questions until someone

1111
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,320
else puts their hand up here um

1112
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,600
think about your slides at the start i

1113
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,519
agree 2012 is the good old days

1114
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,799
and and that's awesome and then i think

1115
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,559
about this week right with the exchange

1116
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,039
bowl

1117
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,799
and that going from zero 100 in like

1118
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,159
five minutes

1119
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,919
that sort of stuff now where where orgs

1120
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,640
are like there is no time from from

1121
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,399
disclosure to go

1122
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,919
you know by the time you literally grab

1123
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,360
your coffee and have logged in it's too

1124
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,480
late sort of thing

1125
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,919
do you see any impact around that sort

1126
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,480
of stuff yeah i think

1127
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,440
um it's it's really prioritization you

1128
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,760
know

1129
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,919
we had a we had an issue come in from

1130
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,240
the 10 cent team to tesla

1131
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,519
um that was like a full chain on the car

1132
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,279
and and they had that they received it

1133
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,760
they engineered a fix they had it fully

1134
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,519
deployed out to their entire fleet over

1135
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,519
ota in 11 days

1136
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,480
right which is um that doesn't happen by

1137
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,360
accident

1138
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
so so the thing with with those folk you

1139
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,799
know they started running

1140
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,919
a a program actually with us about six

1141
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,440
years ago at this point

1142
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
and you know part of what that gave them

1143
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,799
the ability to do was to figure out

1144
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,240
where is the low hanging fruit where are

1145
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,440
the things that can be seen from the

1146
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,240
outside

1147
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,919
you know as they added incentives how do

1148
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,519
i dig people in deeper to figure out

1149
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,519
what the outside in view looks like

1150
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,200
and that allowed them to basically spend

1151
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,559
more of their time on the proactive

1152
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,360
stuff

1153
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,760
like architecting a regression program

1154
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,799
and an ota

1155
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,559
service to get all the cars patched if

1156
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,880
they needed to in a hurry so

1157
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,960
yeah i think that's how this fits in i i

1158
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,799
think you know can can a crowd come in

1159
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,919
and boot

1160
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,320
defenders out i like the idea of

1161
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,960
basically

1162
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,040
you know crowdsource threat hunting uh

1163
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,119
in a sense there's some sense to that i

1164
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:11,599
think

1165
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,119
and also probably to call out as well

1166
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,000
that we're actually doing a lot of

1167
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,520
point-to-point work as well

1168
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,599
so the whole idea of crowdsourcing as a

1169
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,119
model that's really good for driving

1170
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,960
people down to get impact

1171
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,359
um not to go back too much to the pitch

1172
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,079
slide but

1173
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,679
basically finding the right people to do

1174
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,879
the right thing and engaging them

1175
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,440
one-off

1176
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,599
um on a task or an effort basis is

1177
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,960
something that we do as well so

1178
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
there's lots of ways to cut the cookie

1179
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,239
yep cool

1180
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,119
someone's got a yep i'll start here and

1181
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,760
then we'll go up the back

1182
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,239
um yeah i love what you guys do i guess

1183
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:42,800
um

1184
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,760
just in the context of companies that

1185
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,679
have previously taken legal action to

1186
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,719
try and prevent

1187
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,079
the you know bugs be getting out there

1188
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,079
or even researchers doing their work

1189
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,520
are you seeing much of a downward trend

1190
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,960
in that sort of attitude from from

1191
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,800
different industries

1192
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,119
i'm what i'm saying it's not so much a

1193
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,040
downward trend as it is an upward trend

1194
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,640
of people being proactive

1195
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,839
to say that's we could do better

1196
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,000
um i think that's the traditional

1197
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,760
reaction you know

1198
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,359
i mean we're coming off 30 years of

1199
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,480
people assuming they can legislate

1200
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,520
attackers away from their staff which

1201
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,800
is increasingly like provably untrue

1202
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
at this point in time so focus thinking

1203
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,240
about that right but then you've got

1204
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,119
stuff like the

1205
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,839
um the department of homeland security

1206
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,400
with

1207
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
with uh their binding operational

1208
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
directive 2001 which were a part of

1209
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,400
helping right so that forces every

1210
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,240
federal agency in the u.s to start

1211
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
a vdp and it has things in there like

1212
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,839
you know proactive coordinated

1213
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,680
vulnerability disclosure

1214
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,480
and hack a safe harbor for for basically

1215
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,839
exemption against cfa

1216
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,320
and dmca and things like that so the

1217
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,599
more of that stuff happens

1218
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,400
i think the less like the dark side of

1219
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,240
it will go down because it becomes less

1220
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,400
of a it becomes more obviously an uncool

1221
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,599
thing to do

1222
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,720
i think part of what we're trying to do

1223
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,240
with disclosure is to actually make it

1224
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,520
something that people can

1225
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,000
almost market it's like here's like you

1226
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,079
know the green padlock for the internet

1227
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,520
in terms of my maturity as an

1228
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,520
organization to receive feedback from

1229
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,079
the outside

1230
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,160
world if you get consumers to the point

1231
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,200
where they're looking at that and saying

1232
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,560
i feel safer

1233
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,240
working with that person and this person

1234
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,680
then i think it's going to accelerate

1235
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,839
so yeah that's some of the stuff that's

1236
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,079
going on

1237
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
hi casey um hey so have you

1238
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,720
ever had a threat actor

1239
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,480
pose as a company to uh try to get you

1240
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,119
do some

1241
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,160
hacking on their behalf and uh

1242
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
whether you've had that how did you deal

1243
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
with it or

1244
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,560
what do you do to prevent it or minimize

1245
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,520
that risk

1246
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,359
we've we've definitely so i'll answer

1247
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,720
the end of that first because it's

1248
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,359
probably

1249
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,800
um the the broadest part of the answer

1250
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,680
we check everything so so we're not it's

1251
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,400
not a

1252
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,280
like click click click start um process

1253
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,800
on on the platform and and

1254
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,640
we kind of it's honestly it's more

1255
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,240
expensive it's more painful for us to

1256
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,599
orchestrate it like that but for the

1257
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,560
sake of

1258
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
you know the safety of everyone involved

1259
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,640
on both sides that's just a design

1260
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,720
decision that we decided to make

1261
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,880
plus this is often hard to do so it's

1262
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
like understanding where people are

1263
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,520
actually up to and helping them through

1264
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,880
the process of writing a policy and

1265
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,320
preparing all that kind of stuff that's

1266
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,000
where we insert ourselves so if anything

1267
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,960
looks weird coming through that process

1268
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,200
that's when it'll get flagged

1269
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,960
it's not um i can't think of a threat

1270
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,599
actor

1271
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,160
specifically we've booted people off uh

1272
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,040
the platform

1273
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,119
um for basically just you know

1274
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,800
exploiting the crowd or doing doing the

1275
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,320
wrong thing in that sense

1276
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,960
um we've pretty proactively taken a

1277
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,640
stand against different industries like

1278
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,839
there was a spousal

1279
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,640
spyware thing that's uh they got hacked

1280
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,920
and basically responded saying we're

1281
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,119
going to launch a bug banning program

1282
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,240
we're going to talk to hacker 1 and bug

1283
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,119
crowd

1284
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,400
and we basically turned around said no

1285
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,640
you guys can go die in a fire because

1286
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,160
that's like you shouldn't exist

1287
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,400
so stuff like that is thank you um

1288
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,800
yeah it's laterally addressing your

1289
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,400
question i think like in terms of you

1290
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,040
know

1291
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,839
russia or or china or you know like an

1292
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,520
apt actor trying to do that stuff we

1293
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,160
haven't

1294
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,000
we haven't seen that we've seen things

1295
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,760
if anything even smells like that we'll

1296
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,359
dig right into it to make sure that it's

1297
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,240
kosher

1298
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,119
so that's how we operate uh do you think

1299
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,560
it's actually getting harder like post

1300
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
the mca where you're seeing

1301
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
vendors of products putting anti-pen

1302
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,240
testing stuff into the contracts you're

1303
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,599
signing

1304
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,119
and it's just you know more challenging

1305
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,880
to kind of bring them in

1306
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,400
do the pen test on the product find the

1307
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,079
bugs and then have it be reported

1308
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:38,960
through whatever

1309
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,560
you know back up to them without having

1310
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,800
legal challenges coming back down

1311
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,680
yeah um so so votes was a pretty good

1312
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,640
example of that

1313
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,640
uh there was a blockchain

1314
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,240
voting company that decided they could

1315
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,079
solve the 2020 election before it will

1316
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,280
caught on fire

1317
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,160
basically and then a bunch of uh

1318
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,359
researchers from

1319
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,760
the university of michigan i think kind

1320
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,440
of tore their stuff apart and said

1321
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
y'all shouldn't be doing this especially

1322
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
with such a short

1323
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,200
window and and honestly with it with a

1324
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,640
country that at that point in time was

1325
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,160
under so much tension it's just a

1326
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,000
terrible idea what's not

1327
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,880
um they went down the route of using

1328
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,640
cfaa and dmca

1329
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,800
to basically suppress that research so

1330
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,160
it's still a thing that happens that was

1331
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,920
last year

1332
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,960
it's still very much a thing that

1333
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,640
happened off the back of that we um we

1334
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,280
actually

1335
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
through the group that worked with

1336
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,119
disclosure put together a open letter

1337
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:33,440
like

1338
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,160
jim langman um he's a congressperson

1339
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,359
signed it and a whole bunch of other

1340
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,079
folk

1341
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,240
and we pretty like soundly kind of hit

1342
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,280
him on the head and said that's

1343
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,960
don't be going there because we've

1344
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,320
worked really hard

1345
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,920
to help everyone understand that hackers

1346
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,680
are here to help not just to harm

1347
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,280
and you're actually damaging that part

1348
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,000
as well as potentially democracy so

1349
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,359
let's just maybe not do that but yeah to

1350
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,480
your question it's still very much a

1351
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,240
thing that happens i i i think there is

1352
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,599
this um

1353
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,960
you know this general idea i think this

1354
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,320
is relevant to everyone not just the

1355
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,119
hunters and

1356
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,480
and whatever else because ultimately

1357
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,240
this is what we're doing to

1358
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,640
deal with our adversary here right um

1359
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,319
there's this idea that if it's in the

1360
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,599
law that

1361
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,680
uh you know it's illegal to hack my

1362
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,599
staff then for some reason

1363
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,200
the adversary is going to read that law

1364
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,400
and obey it even though they're not in

1365
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,079
the same country half the time

1366
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,760
and whatever else it's silly um

1367
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,480
and i think being able to call it out

1368
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,000
like that without making people feel

1369
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,599
stupid in the process is part of what

1370
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,720
we've been trying to do

1371
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,160
it's not like hey you're an idiot stop

1372
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,760
thinking that because it's dumb

1373
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,359
because that's not helpful it's more

1374
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,280
like no here's how this works

1375
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,520
in real life and here's a better way

1376
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,040
like here's the carrot do you want that

1377
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,599
instead of

1378
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,680
trying to come in with the stick so yeah

1379
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
hi i'm just just thinking outside of the

1380
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,880
box a bit here

1381
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,119
you're mainly with bug bounty i assume

1382
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,720
you're looking at people coming in from

1383
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,760
the outside

1384
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,400
but but in the last two months we've had

1385
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,760
a

1386
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,560
major intrusions in brisbane at sites

1387
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,079
i'm maintaining

1388
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,560
where people are are selling from an

1389
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,520
email

1390
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,800
something and and something i've never

1391
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,760
seen before

1392
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,440
this this thing has started like

1393
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,680
battleship galactica it's gone through

1394
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,760
not through all the shared folders but

1395
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,440
right through the entire operating

1396
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,640
system right through all the servers

1397
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,400
just bloody demolished everything in the

1398
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,119
site

1399
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,319
now now now are you doing anything about

1400
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,240
and i assume you'd call that a trojan in

1401
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,440
a way because it's gone in

1402
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,599
it was set to to run at um three or

1403
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,200
three a.m saturday morning and just went

1404
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,640
through and just boom

1405
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,920
now i i fortunately had a i've got a

1406
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,640
honeypot collector which basically held

1407
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,240
it so i just watched this thing go

1408
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,200
and i was able to stop it but not after

1409
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,440
massive destruction within two hours

1410
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,599
have you got anything that works to

1411
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,359
manage that because you've got see once

1412
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,599
someone's inside the network and they

1413
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,720
can do anything you want

1414
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,640
yeah how do you stop that what have you

1415
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
got to so so this is a

1416
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,079
and it kind of goes to what i was saying

1417
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,839
before people hear bug bounty and they

1418
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:02,960
think

1419
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,040
and by crowd obviously they're sort of

1420
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,240
in the name so

1421
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,720
um that's the noisiest version of what

1422
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,079
we do it's about

1423
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,440
15 percent of what happens on the

1424
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,000
platform the rest of it's private

1425
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,440
and that's a combination of private

1426
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,119
external private internal

1427
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,240
um you know pay for effort internal uh

1428
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,480
doing things like um you know

1429
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,520
simulations

1430
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,079
uh you know like basically starting to

1431
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,200
build in like crowdsource threat

1432
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,960
modeling into the process to be able to

1433
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,400
help you get ahead of that stuff like in

1434
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
terms of i've just double clicked on

1435
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,319
malware can you help me stop it

1436
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,680
no um basically and i don't think anyone

1437
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
in in the offensive space could could

1438
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
reasonably say yes to that because

1439
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
that's more an issue of preparedness

1440
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,440
and and you know design like blast

1441
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
radius containment stuff like that

1442
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,280
um but what we can do is say all right

1443
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,800
if this was to get loose what would

1444
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,599
happen

1445
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,760
you know what are the what are the uh

1446
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,440
the shorter paths in terms of like

1447
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,040
broader network exploitation that are

1448
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,079
available that you

1449
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,480
should probably mitigate next and then

1450
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,000
to be able to do that on a continuous

1451
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,640
basis

1452
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,280
so an example of that was the um the air

1453
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,119
force cloud computing environment

1454
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,520
we did a source code review on on the

1455
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,480
systems that are

1456
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,400
basically pushing workloads up into that

1457
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
that's like a tssci

1458
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,359
skiff environment for for them and we

1459
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:17,920
did

1460
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,520
we did testing on that bouncing around

1461
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,960
on the inside of there

1462
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,720
we've bounced around on the inside like

1463
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,119
we've got basically jump boxes and and

1464
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,760
and um work into a lot of pretty

1465
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,280
interesting places and ones that you

1466
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,000
wouldn't

1467
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,680
and probably shouldn't honestly do a bug

1468
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,839
bounty in terms of going out to the open

1469
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,440
market and saying hey you'll come hack

1470
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,640
us and we'll pay you

1471
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,240
they're not in a position where that's

1472
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,800
even necessarily a good idea

1473
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,960
but they can access the right kind of

1474
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,880
talent for their environment

1475
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,599
from you know a broader audience and

1476
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,200
then we can basically drop them off

1477
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,480
vet the talent make sure people are

1478
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,040
trustworthy like if it's government work

1479
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,319
you're going to have like

1480
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,400
you know validation of sovereignty and

1481
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,680
all those sorts of things that come into

1482
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,640
it as well that's all

1483
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,040
part of how it works yeah so there's one

1484
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,319
more up the back we'll do that as the

1485
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:02,880
last one

1486
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,720
awesome you talked earlier about um

1487
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,319
sorry can you can you just wave at me i

1488
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,240
can't see oh there you go thank you

1489
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,960
you talked earlier about uh sort of

1490
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,079
you're really excited about the

1491
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:16,880
opportunities

1492
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,560
to divert young people who might

1493
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,160
otherwise sort of go to a life of crime

1494
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,079
into sort of more productive roles

1495
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,079
within the information security industry

1496
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,800
what are your views on how how those

1497
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,599
sorts of people

1498
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,440
those young people who maybe are leaning

1499
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,599
towards um

1500
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,680
less savory kinds of action how that's

1501
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,200
talked about uh what are your views and

1502
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,319
how it's talked about in public in the

1503
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,440
media and in the industry

1504
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,520
i hate it are there things you think

1505
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,119
that are problematic or sort of

1506
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,560
alienating those people and pushing them

1507
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,400
away from productive opportunities and

1508
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,359
other

1509
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,960
positive things positive ways you think

1510
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,880
we could talk about that

1511
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,040
that's a that's a really that's a really

1512
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,480
important and a really really good

1513
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,040
question i

1514
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,839
i honestly think that um you know my

1515
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,839
wife and i went to a conference in in

1516
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:58,319
canberra

1517
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,880
a couple of years back and there was a

1518
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,599
person

1519
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,000
talking about you know a 15 or a 16 year

1520
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,839
old that they'd gone and

1521
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,240
conducted an operation on and arrested

1522
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,319
and it was so

1523
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,800
like disparaging and and just completely

1524
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,160
almost blind

1525
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,720
to the circumstances of this like minor

1526
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,680
right

1527
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,720
and that's that to me is not

1528
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,560
you know i can understand why it happens

1529
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,480
because it's a it's a fun

1530
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,040
you know story and and whatever else and

1531
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,079
i think the

1532
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,400
sense of a win from having stopped a bad

1533
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,079
actor from doing a thing

1534
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,640
okay fine um but if you're talking about

1535
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,359
someone who's

1536
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,960
who's basically arrived at this position

1537
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,480
out of need

1538
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,160
and not necessarily arriving at that

1539
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,520
position out of

1540
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,319
a deliberate decision to be you know to

1541
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,000
do the wrong thing or to be a bad

1542
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,040
person um you're really kind of throwing

1543
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,800
everyone else in the same bucket

1544
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,040
that could be in that position like the

1545
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,240
precursors to that

1546
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,640
so i think that's i mean in general what

1547
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,280
i've seen is that the idea of

1548
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,720
you know people kind of get this thing

1549
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,160
that there's like a digital equivalent

1550
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,599
of locksmith and a burglar

1551
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,200
you know we've been dealing with locks

1552
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,800
for a long time so everyone kind of gets

1553
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,839
that part but

1554
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,560
the cyber version is still novel i feel

1555
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,680
like we've made a lot of progress and

1556
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,880
just kind of the core understanding of

1557
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,119
what we do but as it relates to youth

1558
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,079
yeah i think there's

1559
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,280
um there's a lot of

1560
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,480
a lot of stuff that gets said that's

1561
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,319
very careless um

1562
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,680
that said i think there's a lot of

1563
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,359
things that that are pretty incredible

1564
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,440
in terms of promoting it as well so

1565
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,520
you know roots asylum in in in defcon

1566
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,119
like i take my kids to that

1567
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,240
um they love it you know my son loves to

1568
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,079
pick locks and and my daughter's

1569
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,400
more of a i want to go through code type

1570
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,000
of person so that's cool like starting

1571
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,280
to see like where their particular

1572
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,240
hacker quirks

1573
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,560
might be and pulling those things out

1574
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,319
and it's positive it's celebrated you

1575
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,359
know you tell people that you've taken

1576
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,560
your kids to a hacker conference and

1577
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,280
they freak out

1578
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,480
and i think that's a really productive

1579
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,319
conversation to have because at that

1580
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,920
point as the parent i can then explain

1581
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,520
that no this is what i'm doing

1582
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,800
like this is this is actually something

1583
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,560
that's incredibly important

1584
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,440
to the future of all of us not just me

1585
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,560
or them

1586
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,640
um and they seem to be leaning into it

1587
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,400
so i want to try to help that

1588
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,000
so yeah hopefully that answers your

1589
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,599
question i think just in general it's

1590
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,800
it's not something we're thinking about

1591
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,319
enough so that's a really cool question

1592
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,760
thank you

1593
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,200
another round of applause for casey

1594
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:25,839
please thank you all

1595
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,680
you
