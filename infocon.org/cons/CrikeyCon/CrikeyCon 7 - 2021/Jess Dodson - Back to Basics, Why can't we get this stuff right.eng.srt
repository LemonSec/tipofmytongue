00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,079
[Applause]

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,720
so

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,359
this talk is called back to basics and

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,279
i've done the pg version on the slide

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,160
but it's actually

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,760
why can't we get this right because

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
we're really bad at it

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,760
um so for those who don't know me my

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,279
name is jess dodson

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,279
also known as girl germs online you can

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,960
come and see me on twitter and hear me

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,719
rant and swear even more

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,600
um i am a purple head ex sis admin

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
turned customer engineer with a focus on

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,079
security and identity so

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,480
i was in the industry for about 15 years

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,879
was an identity system administrator

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,360
and then kind of fell into being a

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,239
security

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,520
engineer somehow um so the cranky face

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,360
that i have on my very first slide is a

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
dead set warning for the rest of the

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,160
talk please

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
i'm very sorry if you feel like i'm

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
lecturing you because i am

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,159
um i'm a little bit cranky that i keep

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,519
seeing this stuff happening

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,360
in the organizations that i go and visit

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,200
or people that i talk to online this

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,520
stuff just isn't being done so

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
for some of you maybe a lot of you i'm

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,520
teaching you

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,759
how to suck eggs and i'm very sorry

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,960
about that um

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
you might feel that a lot of this is

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,000
common sense but

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,240
if it was common sense i'd be seeing it

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,680
more often

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
so i wouldn't be standing up here and

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
telling you how to do it

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,759
um i was really excited to see in the

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,680
keynote that casey's like yeah we're

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,840
doing proactive stuff

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
we're doing like a little bit more like

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,600
we've gone from one percent proactive to

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
two percent

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,600
um so if you see dodgy practices in this

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,960
talk that you

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
are guilty of and don't worry i'll watch

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
you because you'll be like oh crap

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,119
um don't worry you are definitely not

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,000
alone

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
um think of this talk as a way to

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
reaffirm stuff that you

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,680
already know that's good practice it

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,439
isn't deeply technical it isn't possible

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,799
for me to be deeply technical there's

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,000
too much to get through

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
um just think of me as your morning

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
security entertainment with a

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,038
shitload of memes that's my talk um

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,319
feel free to come and chat to me on

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,760
twitter or have a chat to me afterwards

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,720
if you want to talk

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
specifics about anything totally fine to

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
go into it if you want to go into it

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,280
further so

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,720
i've broken it down by the nist

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
framework it was the easiest way to do

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
it someone actually recommended i do it

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
via the nist one and i'm like yeah that

72
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,280
sounds like a good idea

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,480
um most of my focus because i'm

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
technically a blue teamer i think who

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,319
here's blue team

76
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
or would consider themselves blue team

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
yeah a few of you yeah

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,879
we're the ones that you know try and

79
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,040
protect the stuff um

80
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
so i focus a lot on the identify and

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,319
protect

82
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,560
side of things um there's a little bit

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
of love for detect with a smattering of

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
the respond and recoverer

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
so don't stress about writing this stuff

86
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,160
down um

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,400
or freaking out about it because i do

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,920
have a checklist that you can print out

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
i've put it on my blog and i'm going to

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,879
publish it as soon as i get down from

91
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,480
the stage

92
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
so onwards

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,159
first up we're doing identify and i

94
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
identified that we're bad at identifying

95
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,480
things

96
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,360
do you actually know what you have

97
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
is your asset system up to date do you

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,040
know

99
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
the number of systems you have the

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,319
operating systems you're running

101
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,840
the patch levels the appliances

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,319
applications that you have installed who

103
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,400
here raise your hand if you can tell me

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
that your inventory and asset system is

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
completely up-to-date and accurate

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
two people woohoo that's way better than

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,360
i expected um

108
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
so you need to do audits you need to

109
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
make sure that you know what you've got

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
in your organization if you don't know

111
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,080
what you've got

112
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
it's really difficult to be able to a

113
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,720
protect your systems because

114
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
you can't protect it if you don't know

115
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,239
about it and

116
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
if you don't know about it how are you

117
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,879
going to recover it

118
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
single points of failure for tech are

119
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,760
bad but it's way

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
worse when it comes to people so

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,160
one person who knows everything isn't

122
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,639
good

123
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,478
now we have all worked somewhere or

124
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
probably do work somewhere where this is

125
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,040
the norm

126
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
so in my last workplace um his name was

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,040
ken hi ken

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,600
um they are the repository of all

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,479
knowledge they are

130
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,919
a walking wiki wiki not wookiee wiki

131
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,530
um they not only

132
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,680
[Laughter]

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,440
they not only know the what but they

134
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
know the how and the why

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
and i think that's probably more

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,840
important so

137
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
managers tend to rely on them too much

138
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,280
when it comes to meetings or

139
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,520
architects or solutions because they

140
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,199
have that knowledge so

141
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,520
what happens when that person gets sick

142
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,280
or goes on leave

143
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,320
or god forbid leaves the company

144
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,720
or even worse what happens if you have a

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
contractor

146
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
on a six-month rolling contract that

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
lasts for 20 years

148
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
and then the contract stops getting

149
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,919
renewed

150
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,160
we need to share that knowledge we need

151
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
to give them time to write that

152
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,360
knowledge down so we have to get it out

153
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,039
of their heads

154
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,479
we need an adequate sharing of our

155
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,479
skills and responsibilities as well so

156
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,759
one of the things i see is that people

157
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,360
tend to become an sme in something and

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,880
they're like and this is mine and i

159
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,560
shall never share it with anyone

160
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,479
no don't do that share the knowledge

161
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,039
with others

162
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,840
the flip side of this is that everyone's

163
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,120
responsible when there's no one

164
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
responsible

165
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
so we need our business owners and our

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
system owners to own

167
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,039
the risk to their systems and not just

168
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,759
own them but

169
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,039
understand them i don't just want to

170
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,479
yeah yeah it'll be fine i'll tick the

171
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,199
box

172
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,560
except when things go wrong and then

173
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
they'll blame you so

174
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,479
we need to write down why things are

175
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,680
risks and

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
why we believe it shouldn't be done a

177
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,440
certain way risk registers are your

178
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,919
friends

179
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
please have a risk register and we need

180
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,880
our managers to protect their staff in

181
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,080
regards to risks

182
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
for example please don't blame your

183
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
interns when things go wrong

184
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,639
just because it was right doesn't mean

185
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,120
it

186
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,639
is right so the if it's not broken don't

187
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,840
fix it mentality

188
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,080
needs to change look for those of you

189
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,479
who know me windows server 2003 was

190
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,120
great for its time

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
not now if you are still running server

192
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,400
2003

193
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,880
i'm going to get cranky at you so we

194
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,400
need to make sure that we are looking

195
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,680
for efficiencies

196
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,319
looking for ways to innovate i know it's

197
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:40,720
a

198
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
shitty buzz word but trying to find ways

199
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
to do things better

200
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
rather than just sticking with the

201
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
status quo the whole

202
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,759
just because it's always been this way

203
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,360
doesn't mean we always have to do it

204
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
that way

205
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,599
write the thing please for the love of

206
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,080
god

207
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,400
right documentation because it is awful

208
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
to go into organizations and ask them

209
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,520
how stuff runs and they go

210
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,720
it's tedious it's boring it's time

211
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,479
consuming it's a pain in the ass but

212
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,080
it's incredibly important

213
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,280
document everything no matter how

214
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,360
little importance you think that holds

215
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,319
you think that it might not be

216
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
worthwhile for someone else you need to

217
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,039
write it down

218
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,280
if you've had to do something document

219
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
it if you've had to change something

220
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,160
document it in security breaches this

221
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
kind of information

222
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
is vital because then we can work out

223
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,679
what is legitimate versus what is not

224
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,960
we are really really

225
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,919
at educating our users really we

226
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,000
blame them for so much stuff it is our

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
weakest link

228
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
um we need to do it in a more meaningful

229
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,240
way than the way that we do it now

230
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
as techs we tend to complain about our

231
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,080
users and the stupid things that they do

232
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,919
but we wouldn't have as much to complain

233
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,160
about if we were actually educating them

234
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,039
properly

235
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,280
so there is no such thing in my lexicon

236
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,720
as a stupid question

237
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,319
i don't care what the question is

238
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,520
there's no such thing as a stupid

239
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,479
question

240
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,400
let them ask questions without fear of

241
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,199
being mocked or being patronised

242
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,440
spend time with them understand what it

243
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
is that they do

244
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,360
and how their role intersects with the

245
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,000
technology

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
that you they're using and how you can

247
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
better secure that

248
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
you're not expected to be an expert in

249
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,599
what they do so why do we

250
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,360
expect them to be an expert in what we

251
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,000
do

252
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
so now that we've identified our things

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,279
we're going to go and protect them

254
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,519
okay so when we talk about protecting

255
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,720
our cloud infrastructure

256
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,640
everyone goes oh new shiny things

257
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,200
please stop doing that because all that

258
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,680
means

259
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,440
is you're missing all of the stuff that

260
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
you need to protect back on prem

261
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
now i would say that 90 of you are

262
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
probably still running in some kind of a

263
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
hybrid environment

264
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,399
at least when the organizations that i'm

265
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,240
working with i am yet to see anyone

266
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,519
running pure cloud

267
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,040
hybrid is the way it's going to be for a

268
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,480
little while it's just the way it's

269
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,279
going to happen

270
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,200
so make sure that whatever you're doing

271
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
in your cloud environment

272
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
you're doing on-prem so an example from

273
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,000
my experience everyone's like oh

274
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
azure id we've got all this funky stuff

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
we can do no one protects their on-prem

276
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
id and they're synchronized

277
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
which means that your on-prem id is your

278
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
weak link if you're not securing that

279
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
you're not securing azure id

280
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,160
game over

281
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
eat your own dog food we're really bad

282
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,000
at this one

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,120
so we are without a doubt the worst

284
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,000
hypocrites we

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,839
will tell our users to do one thing and

286
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,920
then we'll go and do something else

287
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,480
so if you are an admin of any kind

288
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,360
security

289
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
system network i don't care what kind of

290
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
admin you are you need to be eating your

291
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,519
own dog

292
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,120
food if you are telling your users that

293
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,560
they cannot have local administrative

294
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,079
rights on their machine

295
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,480
you shouldn't either if you are telling

296
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,920
users that there are applications that

297
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
they can't run because they haven't been

298
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
whitelisted or they haven't been

299
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,839
properly tested

300
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,279
don't go in and put exclusions for

301
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,440
yourself to run those same applications

302
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
i don't want to come in and see users

303
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,200
being told one thing

304
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
and admins doing something different if

305
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,519
you expect your users to be doing it

306
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,120
you have to be willing you have to be

307
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,519
happy to do it as well you need to set

308
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,320
that example

309
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
and that also goes for managers so my

310
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,760
big one is c levels

311
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,800
i don't want to go into another

312
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,920
organization and see a ceo with password

313
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,800
never expires set

314
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
ever

315
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,000
i was gonna have password one two three

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,120
on this one but i thought that was a

317
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
little bit obvious

318
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
so default passwords insecure passwords

319
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,839
the same passwords i don't understand

320
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,040
why this is still happening i don't

321
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,399
understand why we're still seeing it it

322
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,240
shouldn't need to be said but it does we

323
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,279
are still seeing it

324
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,600
even now i'm sure we are all aware of

325
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,279
the password one two three issue that i

326
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,240
am referring to

327
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
that i will not name by name um we need

328
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
to make sure that we are

329
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,880
setting correct passwords setting

330
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,399
correct password policies

331
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,480
i come from a microsoft land so we've

332
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,839
got password protector

333
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,600
protection in azure we've got fine grain

334
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,880
password policies

335
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
there are so many ways to prevent these

336
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,399
issues from occurring

337
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,800
um this doesn't just go for your

338
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,399
enterprise either i like that it was

339
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,240
called out in the keynote too

340
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,480
this goes for your home stuff so i don't

341
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,640
want to see default passwords on iot

342
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
devices and

343
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
printers and routers we need to be

344
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
changing all of that stuff

345
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,279
particularly as an admin you are a point

346
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,040
of entry into an organization

347
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
so making sure that you're securing your

348
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,880
home network is just as important

349
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,760
we need to make sure that when we're

350
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,760
having shared credentials that we're

351
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,399
storing them in a little bit better way

352
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,600
than we are now

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,639
so please store them securely use

354
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,160
password managers they're out there

355
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,680
they've been out there for a while

356
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,519
there are paid ones there are free ones

357
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
there are cloud ones there are

358
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
ones that you can run purely on-prem if

359
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
you're paranoid about the cloud i don't

360
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
care what you choose just

361
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
use one of them um something is better

362
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,480
than nothing

363
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
um unless it's you know a post-it note

364
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
stuck to a monitor

365
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
so the other thing that ties into this

366
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,240
is don't block the use of password

367
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
managers the number of organizations

368
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,720
that i see

369
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,600
blocking password manager usage it just

370
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,880
means that all your users are going to

371
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
be doing is making really shitty

372
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
insecure passwords and just incrementing

373
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,680
it by a number every time

374
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
just don't do it um

375
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
another one with this so we're looking

376
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
at our shared accounts

377
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
i don't want to see generic shared

378
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,440
accounts up

379
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,399
in high level privilege groups ever just

380
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,880
don't do it

381
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,920
like service accounts get them out

382
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,519
i don't want to see a single service

383
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,440
account in a domain admin enterprise

384
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
admin global admin

385
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,120
root account aws route none of them i

386
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,240
don't want to see a service account in

387
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,040
there ever

388
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
they shouldn't be there give them the

389
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
correct rights assign them specific

390
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,000
roles and permissions

391
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,240
do not need route do not pass go do not

392
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
collect 200

393
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,839
this isn't hard we should be able to do

394
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
this

395
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,040
robust access control is your friend so

396
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,320
please use it

397
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,160
um tied to the service accounts you need

398
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
to be making sure that when you're

399
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
assigning permissions to not just your

400
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,760
service accounts but also your admins

401
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,880
and your developers

402
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,240
because we all know developers want more

403
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,160
rights than they need um

404
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,279
you need to make sure that you are

405
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,199
giving them the exact rights that they

406
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,160
actually require

407
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
no more no less enough that they can do

408
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,519
their job

409
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,040
but not enough that they can cause

410
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,639
damage you need to limit

411
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,320
their blast radius that is the whole

412
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,120
idea the big one that i see with this

413
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,519
is software that says that their account

414
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,680
or their service account requires

415
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,160
domain admin or local administrative

416
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,800
rights just

417
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,959
not no bad no admin rights for you you

418
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,240
do not get that

419
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,680
um the same goes for externals coming

420
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
into your organization so as an example

421
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,399
i go into organizations i want read

422
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,959
i don't want any right access i don't

423
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,639
want any of that

424
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,160
level of privilege on my account thank

425
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,440
you very much that that's too much

426
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
responsibility and i don't want blame

427
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,599
for anything

428
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,279
rank doesn't equal your rights so this

429
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,000
one's a little bit

430
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
pointed and this goes back to uh job

431
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,279
minus one for me

432
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,040
um just because you have a high rank

433
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,800
doesn't mean you get access to something

434
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,360
so

435
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
just because you're a manager of an

436
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,399
identity team or a group of system

437
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,839
administrators doesn't mean

438
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,440
you get the same access as the people

439
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
who are in that team so i had this

440
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,920
happen to me i had a manager who was

441
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,279
non-technical say that they wanted

442
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,560
domain admin rights over all of my

443
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,440
domains and i'm like

444
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
no no um i fought tooth and nail i won

445
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
thankfully um because they don't need

446
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,040
that level of rights

447
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,320
the way that i like to explain it

448
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,399
um unless you are the person getting the

449
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,920
call at two o'clock in the morning

450
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,839
to fix that system when it's down you

451
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,079
don't need that access

452
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,199
and the other side of this is your

453
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,320
managers

454
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,519
need to trust their staff so you either

455
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
trust your staff or you don't you hired

456
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,120
them for a reason if you don't trust

457
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
them why did you hire them to do their

458
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
job

459
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
if you can put mfa on it put mfa on it

460
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,399
um i'm not a fan of sms authentication

461
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,759
or voice calls but

462
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,720
hey any mfa is better than no mfa so i

463
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,000
want to make sure that everyone here is

464
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,600
actually mfa in all of their accounts

465
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,399
and that's not just

466
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
organizational accounts that's also any

467
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
of their standard accounts because

468
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,240
again you are a point of weakness into

469
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,320
the organization that you work for so

470
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,600
facebook twitter linkedin slack github

471
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,320
reddit

472
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
all of those have the ability to have

473
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,839
mfa turned on turn it on

474
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,240
when it comes to using mfa for your

475
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,519
standard user accounts

476
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,120
turn it on it should be turned on for

477
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
all of your users now a lot of people

478
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
will get up in arms about that

479
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,399
but the users don't want to use them i

480
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,800
think yeah sure fine they don't

481
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,440
so look at doing what we call risk-based

482
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,720
conditional access

483
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,160
users coming in from within your

484
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,759
organization they're coming

485
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,079
in on a network that you know on a

486
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,680
computer that's part of your domain

487
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,480
not a problem you don't need mfa users

488
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,120
coming in

489
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,680
from romania on a machine that's got

490
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
malware that you've never seen before

491
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,839
yeah i'm going to want some mfa on that

492
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,800
there should be more than one

493
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,399
administrative account okay so

494
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
if you are an admin of any system you

495
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,759
should have

496
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,240
more than one account it just goes

497
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,680
without saying i'm really surprised that

498
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
i have to keep saying this this is

499
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,360
probably one of my biggest bug bears

500
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,959
minimum is two it can be far more than

501
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,519
that in my last organization i had five

502
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,880
the way that i like to split it out is

503
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
you should have an account that is your

504
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,559
tier zero so this is your god level

505
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,119
access

506
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,839
root domain admin global admin it

507
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,640
doesn't do

508
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,880
anything else but that doesn't log on to

509
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
computers doesn't log on to

510
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,959
any servers other than your tier zero

511
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,559
after that you've got server admin or

512
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,679
appliance admins

513
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,160
so this is the one that you jump onto

514
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
for servers to do server administration

515
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,520
work with

516
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,640
then you've got your desktop

517
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,839
administration accounts or your

518
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,039
developer accounts

519
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,400
they're the ones that can do local

520
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
administrative rights on your desktops

521
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,400
and then you have a user account and the

522
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
user account can do pretty much nothing

523
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,919
it can surf the web check your email

524
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,440
maybe make a powerpoint presentation

525
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
like this one

526
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,960
the other thing that works really well

527
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,160
with this is using something like

528
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
privileged identity management so

529
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
no user permanently has a role they have

530
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
to request that role be given permission

531
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
to have that role it's then given to

532
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:49,919
them

533
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,520
for a set period of time and then it's

534
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
taken away there's a log

535
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
then of someone requesting it someone

536
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,320
approving it

537
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,840
the reason that it's being requested it

538
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,919
gives you a much better way of tracking

539
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,440
who has done what and why

540
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,320
so when is a firewall not a firewall

541
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
when people keep putting any any rules

542
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,360
in them

543
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
um look i am 100 for

544
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160
keeping your client-side firewall turned

545
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
on um it's

546
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
a good line of defense any line of

547
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,120
defense is better than no defense

548
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,919
um it gives you an extra layer of

549
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,600
security it gives you extra logging

550
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,360
which is great

551
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,039
except if you have any any in place

552
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,480
because it defeats the whole goddamn

553
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,200
purpose

554
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
so can we remove any any rules i know we

555
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,240
use them for testing

556
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,520
i know that a lot of our developers are

557
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,799
like yeah it's the firewall that's

558
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,240
broken it's never the firewall

559
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,440
it's the firewall that's causing the

560
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
problem we need to turn it off fine turn

561
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,080
it off put the any

562
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,520
rule in place make sure that things are

563
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
working and then find out the exact

564
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,760
ports and protocols that it needs

565
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,640
i want to see exact rules put in no more

566
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,400
any any rules

567
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
antivirus at any malware isn't just for

568
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,679
your endpoints

569
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,160
um as long as you make sure that your

570
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,200
exclusions

571
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,840
are maintained and are documented i

572
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,520
should be seeing

573
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
this kind of stuff on servers and on

574
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,720
mobile devices as well the number of

575
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,320
mobile devices that i don't see it on is

576
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
really scary

577
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
so you don't want to make not just your

578
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
own personal machine sick but your

579
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,240
server sick i mean

580
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,360
it looks really sad um

581
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
the number of admins as well who don't

582
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,760
run antivirus or any malware on their

583
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,120
own personal machines

584
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,799
because they'd never click on anything

585
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,160
stupid would they

586
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
no chances are you're also running as

587
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,840
local admin so chances are when you do

588
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,240
click on something stupid which you will

589
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,600
it's going to go off and do stuff on

590
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
your machine so please just

591
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,200
put it on your machine as well it comes

592
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
back to that whole dog food thing if

593
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,919
you're expecting your users to have to

594
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,200
live with it you should be living with

595
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,679
it as well

596
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,440
encryption if you can turn it on turn it

597
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,160
on

598
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,320
um most the time at the moment it's a

599
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,280
clickback

600
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,200
a click box or a click button just just

601
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
check the box say

602
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
do you want to encrypt this why yes yes

603
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,840
i do just click the check box

604
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,960
application whitelisting so it's in the

605
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
asd essential 8

606
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,559
and we're not doing it yet and i i know

607
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,080
that it's incredibly tricky it's

608
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
incredibly hard it's not an easy thing

609
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,799
to do

610
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,080
the number of applications that our

611
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
users are using is varied and

612
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,760
complicated some users use different

613
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,159
things

614
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,400
that's fine i totally get that it's not

615
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,480
the simplest thing to put in place

616
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,320
at the same time i think we can get a

617
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,840
foot in the door by doing application

618
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,440
white listing on our servers

619
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,799
because the applications that are on our

620
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,799
servers should never be changing

621
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,720
and if they are changing why so

622
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
make sure that you are doing some kind

623
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,440
of application white whitelisting on

624
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,000
your servers

625
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
if only two as an example check to see

626
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
if someone's installing tree size

627
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,559
pro on a domain controller to scan all

628
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,240
of their file servers

629
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,159
and no i'm not even kidding and i've

630
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,840
seen it in more than one organization i

631
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,120
don't know what it is about

632
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,200
domain controllers and tree size pro

633
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
seriously

634
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,360
um flip side to this is as part of this

635
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
you need to make sure that your admins

636
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,799
have the tools they need in order to do

637
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,760
their job

638
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,159
so you shouldn't be seeing stuff

639
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,000
changing on servers because

640
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
your admins should have the tools to do

641
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
that either on their own machine or on a

642
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
jump box of some kind

643
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,480
to be able to do their job

644
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
we should be patching i mean everyone's

645
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,080
patched their exchange servers right

646
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,240
um make sure that you are checking for

647
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,440
your patches and checking for your

648
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,880
updates you have to be patching

649
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,679
absolutely everything um do your testing

650
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:40,480
absolutely

651
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
but make sure you're applying those

652
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,600
patches as soon as is feasible i don't

653
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,720
want to see

654
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,880
any more 12-month patching cycles it's

655
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
okay we'll do them all in a lump sum at

656
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,600
the end no

657
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,919
stop it do them as soon as you possibly

658
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,640
can

659
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,159
and this doesn't just apply to operating

660
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,440
systems this also applies to your

661
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,120
software you need to be making sure your

662
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,559
software is up to date

663
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,799
physical security is still a thing okay

664
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,440
so not everybody is in the cloud

665
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,919
we still have servers on-prem um and

666
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,480
they're not

667
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,799
always located in really nice secure

668
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,919
color data centers

669
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,520
we just don't have that for some people

670
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
so who has

671
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,640
access to your servers if a bad guy

672
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
has unrestricted physical access to your

673
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,559
computer it is not your computer anymore

674
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,240
don't have servers running under desks

675
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,400
make sure that they are secured in a way

676
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,760
that you can monitor them and make sure

677
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,039
that they are physically

678
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,440
secured i have seen it happen remote

679
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,280
office hit by a

680
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,159
disaster the doors obviously weren't

681
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:44,960
working

682
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,600
someone walked in and walked out with a

683
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
file server and domain controller

684
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
it's not that tricky to unplug cables

685
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,840
and just walk out with a box

686
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
so we're now moving on to the we think

687
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,320
something has happened or we know

688
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,400
something has happened stage

689
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
in my new position from a security

690
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,520
perspective logs

691
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
is a bug bear of mine and one of the

692
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,559
things that i'm really quite

693
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,080
keen on harping on and making sure that

694
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
people are paying attention to

695
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
um and i know that there is someone up

696
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,559
the back who's like yeah um we're not

697
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
centrally storing them and they roll

698
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,480
over really damn quickly

699
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,880
we need to be storing our logs in a way

700
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,240
that we can look at them so

701
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,480
your event logs system security

702
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
application whatever they are they are

703
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
incredibly important when it comes to

704
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,919
working out what happened and when

705
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
so it isn't just for security incidents

706
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
it's also for your day-to-day

707
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
business as usual help desk stuff so

708
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
your event logs can be a lifesaver

709
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
you need to understand where to find

710
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,440
them understand what they are

711
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
and how you can read them you need to

712
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,279
know what's in them

713
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,120
and when i say centrally storing them i

714
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,039
also mean in a way that you can

715
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,440
correlate between them slight plug asha

716
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
sentinel is amazing

717
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,320
um we're finding that the logs are

718
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,159
rolling over far too quickly we're not

719
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,600
getting enough time to be able to jump

720
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,679
on and see what's happened so

721
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,799
uh an issue occurs someone's popped

722
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,799
leaked credentials gone out we know that

723
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,159
they've logged on but we can't actually

724
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,440
take a look at the logs of when they've

725
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,799
logged on because they rolled over two

726
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,679
days ago

727
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,360
so making sure that you are centrally

728
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,960
storing them because

729
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
when a breach occurs and it is a when

730
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,080
not an

731
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,960
if you need those logs and i understand

732
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
that storing your logs is expensive but

733
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,320
it's far more expensive

734
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,960
not to have them when a breach occurs

735
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,000
than it is

736
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,480
to actually store the logs at the point

737
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,440
in time

738
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,559
insider threats are still a thing so

739
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,640
we need to keep watch and that makes

740
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,240
means making sure that we're being

741
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
watched so

742
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,279
we need to have monitoring over your

743
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,960
security systems not just your general

744
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,240
day-to-day systems

745
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,200
it's not enough to monitor all of your

746
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
user access systems you need to be

747
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,039
monitoring your security systems as well

748
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,240
because a smart attacker will know if i

749
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,000
disable that then hopefully

750
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
they're not going to be able to see me

751
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,360
because that's the security system so

752
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,840
you need to make sure from an insider

753
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,200
threat perspective and an attacker

754
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,559
perspective that you are monitoring

755
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:22,960
those

756
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,880
so you've got to break glass account you

757
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,000
need to make sure you're monitoring for

758
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,880
its use

759
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,799
you've got scene rules and they might

760
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
change you need to monitor for those

761
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,039
being changed

762
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,600
you've got logs that you're centrally

763
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
storing you're essentially storing them

764
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,159
right

765
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,200
you need to make sure that you're

766
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,440
logging that and monitoring those and

767
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,880
monitoring when they're deleted or

768
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,559
changed

769
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,240
people logging on to a domain controller

770
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,000
to use tree size pro we need to monitor

771
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,880
for that

772
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
and thwack them

773
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
fine-tuning your security systems for

774
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,080
the love of god please

775
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,000
fine-tune them i am so sick of going

776
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,200
into organizations where they have

777
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,720
turned on so much stuff

778
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,960
and it's generating so much noise that

779
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,559
you cannot see

780
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,520
anything so it is no use alerting for

781
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,240
everything

782
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,679
because it's just like the boy who cried

783
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,960
wolf how are you actually going to be

784
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
able to see

785
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,000
the signal for the noise it's just not

786
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,080
possible so make sure that what is being

787
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,799
sent through

788
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,799
is legitimate is actionable you can

789
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,400
actually do something with it

790
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,559
we need to make sure that we're tuning

791
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,799
based on our false and benign positives

792
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,919
so there are things that are going to

793
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,200
come through that are benign positives

794
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
that we just need to say

795
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,240
yes we know that's something that's

796
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,000
happened and yes normally it would be an

797
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,640
issue

798
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,159
but that was our admin doing something

799
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,880
legitimate that's okay

800
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,520
don't just stand up new tools because

801
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,480
they're shiny

802
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,120
and new and fun to play with um the

803
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,039
traditional approach that i've seen is

804
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,120
get 90 of your stuff monitored that's

805
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,279
awesome we've got 10 left to go oh look

806
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,960
new shiny tool will monitor

807
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,120
the 10 with the new tool and then we'll

808
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
get 90

809
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,400
of that 10 monitor on the new shiny tool

810
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
and then oh look a new tool another 10

811
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,480
in perpetuity please just pick

812
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,159
one um paying attention to alerts as

813
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,520
well so there is no point in having

814
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,880
alerts if no one is actually looking at

815
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,840
them

816
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,679
if no one's doing anything with them

817
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,279
what's the point in creating alerts

818
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,279
so we're looking at respond and recover

819
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,720
and i don't do a lot of this this isn't

820
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,679
my job i do the

821
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,600
identify and protect stuff but we've got

822
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
a little bit of love here

823
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,520
so back up all of your stuff

824
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
um anything that's considered important

825
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
anything that's considered vital

826
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,960
back it up crypto is still out there

827
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
users are still

828
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,320
clicking on stupid and we can

829
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,279
mitigate as much as we possibly can

830
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,720
but happens okay so we need to make

831
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,919
sure that we are backing things up so

832
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:48,960
that we can restore it because when

833
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,480
we're backing up

834
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,440
we're testing our backups yeah yeah

835
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,559
everyone goes through and tests their

836
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,919
backups right

837
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,600
so it's no use to back something up if

838
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,120
you're not actually testing the restore

839
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
process because a backup is only good if

840
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,159
you could actually restore

841
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,960
it so make sure that you are testing

842
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,080
those restores regularly

843
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,840
an incident response plan have a plan

844
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
any kind of plan i'm so used to seeing

845
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,039
people bearing their head in the sand

846
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,799
and going no no it'll be fine it'll

847
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,159
never happen to us

848
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,440
until it does so tied to this is very

849
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,039
similar to the backups just like your

850
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,600
backup

851
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,440
make sure you're testing this plan

852
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
because it's no use having a plan if you

853
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
haven't tested it

854
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,799
make sure you're updating it as well

855
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
it's no use having a disaster recovery

856
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,480
or business continuity plan that has a

857
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,080
contact list that's five years out of

858
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,960
date

859
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
and still has my contact details in

860
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,480
there to help restore the active

861
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,200
directory

862
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,000
there's not going to be any use the

863
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
other thing with this one is

864
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,240
managers when it comes to an incident

865
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,360
back off your techs

866
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,679
are trying to do their best they are

867
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,520
trying to do their work

868
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,559
let them do their job don't stand over

869
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
their shoulder and watch them don't send

870
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,919
them emails or ims

871
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,080
asking them where stuff is at designate

872
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,760
a person to be the single point

873
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
of contact when it comes to an incident

874
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,880
and go through them

875
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,919
and don't go around them

876
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,840
i've seen it too many times where a tech

877
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
has been focused on trying to fix

878
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,159
something

879
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
with no joke seven levels of management

880
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,200
around their desk you're not gonna do

881
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,279
any good work when you have seven people

882
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,039
breathing down your neck

883
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,279
so let your techs do their job when it

884
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,320
comes to incident management

885
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,919
everyone screws up

886
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,480
everyone it is inevitable everyone will

887
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,360
screw up in

888
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,799
in their lifetime and particularly in

889
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,960
their job it is totally fine

890
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,559
my biggest piece of advice in regards to

891
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,799
this is to own your own mistakes

892
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,720
don't try and hide them don't try and

893
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,919
minimize them

894
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,159
don't try and pretend it never happened

895
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,440
um be honest and say you screwed up

896
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,880
but a lot of this comes down to the

897
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,120
organizational culture that you work in

898
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,679
so if your organization plays the blame

899
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,399
game

900
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,600
no one is going to want to put their

901
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
hand in the air and say that they are

902
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
the one who up

903
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,600
they're just not going to want to do

904
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,760
that so you need to make sure

905
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,480
that your managers are embodying that

906
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,360
culture of

907
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,279
they can your users can come forward

908
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,720
your texts can come forward and say that

909
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,279
they have done something stupid

910
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,880
no one is going to want to work for a

911
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,520
company where a low-level employee gets

912
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,960
stabbed in the back for doing something

913
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,720
stupid that should have been caught much

914
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,039
earlier

915
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,720
and piggybacking perfectly off the last

916
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,840
point

917
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,880
it is okay to ask for help um

918
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,559
there are a range of different

919
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,399
organizations out there when it comes to

920
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,200
security

921
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
who can assist you and help you you

922
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,200
don't have to do it alone

923
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,360
for techs who are in security you have a

924
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,200
tribe of people you are at a security

925
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,559
conference now

926
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,440
um talk to the people that you are with

927
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,640
get their knowledge

928
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,559
share information if you need their

929
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,720
support rely on them that's

930
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,200
that's what a tribe is for you can't

931
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,240
know everything

932
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,679
and you can't do it all by yourself

933
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,600
and in relation to that i would like to

934
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,640
say thanks to

935
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,919
my nerd tribe so um a couple of people

936
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,440
helped me out with this particular talk

937
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
so bronwyn who i work with she gave me

938
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,120
the idea for the nist breakdown which

939
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,080
was very lovely

940
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,720
and charlie was my very first audience

941
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,679
member

942
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,360
who tested my talk and went yeah that's

943
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,559
pretty good here's a few extra things

944
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,159
you can add in

945
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,080
thank you very much as well to crikeycon

946
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,760
for taking a chance on me particularly

947
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,360
after my last talk

948
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,200
which i think scared the pants off of

949
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,480
everybody

950
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,320
um and lastly to my og nerds who know

951
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,039
who they are

952
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,000
so they were my very last test audience

953
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,840
they are awesome human beings they sent

954
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,360
me beautiful flowers and chocolates for

955
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,039
my birthday

956
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,120
and they listen to me rant all day and

957
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,360
every day about this kind of stuff

958
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,799
i couldn't have written this talk

959
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,679
without their support

960
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,080
now this link is going to take you off

961
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,880
to the checklist

962
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,399
don't go clicking on it or trying to go

963
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,919
to it now it's not going to work i

964
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,360
haven't made it active yet give me a

965
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,640
couple of minutes to get down from the

966
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,399
stage and then i'll make it active

967
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,919
so this is going to give you a checklist

968
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,039
of all the things that i've said you

969
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,720
should be doing so you can use that to

970
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,120
go

971
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,640
look we're doing all these really cool

972
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,720
things oh holy we've got so much we

973
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,080
need to do

974
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,919
or you can use it to thwack the people

975
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,679
who need to do these things

976
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,960
so hopefully we can now secure all of

977
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
the things so that's my aim i just want

978
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,559
you to be a little bit more secure in

979
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,760
the way you do things a lot of this

980
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,279
stuff is incredibly basic

981
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,360
it's common sense it's stuff we should

982
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,720
have already been doing

983
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,640
so please go off and do it

984
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,399
so this is my happy face because you've

985
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,080
all stayed around to listen

986
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,000
so thank you very much for coming um and

987
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,519
for listening to me and for not booing

988
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,360
me off stage or looking shame faced when

989
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
i was

990
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
getting cranky at you so if you think

991
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,519
i've missed something

992
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,039
and i know i will have missed something

993
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,399
there was so much that i could put in

994
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,640
this talk i could only fit so much in

995
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,080
so if you think there is stuff that i've

996
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,679
missed please do

997
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,600

1015
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,080
[Laughter]

1016
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,169
[Music]

1017
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,039
most of you probably realize that that

1018
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,119
speakers you know they're here of their

1019
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,719
own time today sharing their knowledge

1020
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,199
with us

1021
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,280
and and their passion what people don't

1022
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,879
see i guess is the lead up that actually

1023
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,918
goes into this

1024
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,320
submitting to the cfp coming up with the

1025
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
idea writing the slides

1026
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
going through all the self-doubt around

1027
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,359
when anyone's going to want to listen to

1028
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:23,839
hear

1029
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,520
what you have to say and jess has done

1030
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,280
all that and then turned up on her

1031
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,199
birthday kind of thing which is a pretty

1032
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,719
big deal i think so

1033
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,839
another big round of applause for jess

1034
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
please

1035
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,918
we've got a swag bag here does anyone

1036
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,440
have any questions for jess

1037
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,119
um and it can be questions about

1038
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,520
birthday presents

1039
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,280
lego all the lego uh hello jess my name

1040
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,159
is diego

1041
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,719
i think your talk was amazing thank you

1042
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,679
um

1043
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,520
i i have just one thing that perhaps

1044
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,520
uh would complete the excellent talk

1045
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,880
which is um tabletops so

1046
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,280
putting you know all of these security

1047
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,000
controls

1048
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,359
and and principles that you share

1049
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,359
sometimes you know we share them here in

1050
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,800
the conference and that's great

1051
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,079
but then how can we actually put our

1052
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,440
leaders and

1053
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,960
colleagues in a situation where they

1054
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,040
have to actually get in front of this

1055
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,119
stuff and answer some questions and

1056
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,200
how would you react if something

1057
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,599
happened like this or like that

1058
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,680
and they need to actually their real

1059
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,200
time

1060
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,680
respond to you as to you know they

1061
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,480
thought train

1062
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,960
what would they do so it's like um and i

1063
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,400
think the format for that

1064
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,359
in in enterprises is tabletops it's like

1065
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,520
designing a little story

1066
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,880
uh just a pretty story whatever and then

1067
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,440
you're

1068
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,240
throwing it at them and running that

1069
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,920
that show is like a little

1070
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,880
micro one hour show where you get to see

1071
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,359
them oh

1072
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,400
you are very hopeful um no i absolutely

1073
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
agree and i think tabletops are

1074
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
fantastic um and i think that they

1075
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,839
should be

1076
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,359
i will now include that as part of mine

1077
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,880
so thank you very much um

1078
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,560
and i also think they need to be part of

1079
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
your um security planning so when you're

1080
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,920
doing your incident planning

1081
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
it to me it's a no-brainer to have that

1082
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,079
as part of that plan you need to

1083
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,280
actually include that when you're

1084
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,480
building that plan

1085
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,400
um so i would say that when you're doing

1086
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,680
your instant plans

1087
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,000
and doing your instant plan testing it

1088
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,920
would be as part of a tabletop exercise

1089
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,119
so that way you can run through that

1090
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,280
plan make sure that it actually works

1091
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,400
make sure that you've got all of the

1092
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,240
right people listed and you've covered

1093
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,960
all of your base systems

1094
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,440
any other questions hey jess great talk

1095
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,000
um

1096
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,480
i definitely felt shame a few times uh

1097
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,760
it's good to hear someone say those

1098
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,920
things out loud though

1099
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,040
um my question's around uh

1100
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,920
some things so i'm hoping to get some

1101
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,560
your thoughts

1102
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,280
on how you deal with some organizational

1103
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,920
units that

1104
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,960
love to sidestep the machine and

1105
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,839
deploy shadow i.t and how we go around

1106
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,520
the first thing you said there

1107
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,839
identifying helping help them to

1108
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,760
identify those

1109
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,880
shadow i.t is probably one of the

1110
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,320
hardest ones and the reason that we end

1111
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,440
up with shadow it

1112
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,920
is either the i.t processes that we have

1113
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,040
in place

1114
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,599
are too restrictive and it's preventing

1115
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,920
usability in some way so

1116
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,000
i think and part of the issue that i

1117
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,520
have with security is that a lot of what

1118
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,000
we do

1119
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,359
as security professionals we're like

1120
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,200
yeah tech all the cool stuff

1121
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,920
the tech's the smallest part it's the

1122
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
people side that we

1123
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
really are bad at and we really screw up

1124
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,320
at and trying to work out what those

1125
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,680
people are wanting to do what they're

1126
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,960
trying to do and

1127
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
why they've gone around our processes in

1128
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,400
order to be able to do that

1129
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
what have we missed that is making them

1130
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,560
turn to shadow i.t instead of coming to

1131
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,960
us

1132
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
and i think that's the biggest point is

1133
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,480
actually getting on board with your

1134
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,200
users

1135
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,960
and getting on board with system owners

1136
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,560
and particularly the people who are

1137
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,400
looking at implementing shadow i.t and

1138
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,359
saying what is it that we're not doing

1139
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,400
that you need us to do in order to

1140
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,119
do your job

1141
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,079
probably got time for one more thank you

1142
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,280
for that that was awesome

1143
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,240
um your thoughts on staffing i've seen

1144
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,119
so many

1145
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,440
in some of the organizations i'm seeing

1146
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,480
lots and lots of

1147
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,040
uh policy people not enough execution

1148
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,560
people

1149
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,760
could that be something you could add

1150
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,640
please have security operations

1151
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,520
 god i'm so tired of going into

1152
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,280
orgs and they do have governance and

1153
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,880
risk and no one's doing security

1154
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
operations i think you were saying

1155
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,800
your security operations pretty much

1156
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,560
because you have to be that was me in my

1157
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,599
last role as well

1158
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,280
i was an identity administrator looking

1159
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,720
after domain controllers

1160
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,480
and i kind of fell into doing security

1161
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,960
operations because no one else was doing

1162
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,440
it

1163
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,359
organizations definitely do need to take

1164
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,640
a better approach

1165
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,960
to staffing when it comes to security

1166
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,320
they actually need to have dedicated

1167
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,960
people

1168
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,560
who are responsible for looking after

1169
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,240
that looking after the monitoring making

1170
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,359
sure that the

1171
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,040
systems are actually secure rather than

1172
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,160
just the people who are setting the

1173
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,960
policies

1174
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,280
i am seeing it being done more i am

1175
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,960
seeing more socks being stood up which

1176
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,920
is great

1177
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,480
um but it's that high level tiered admin

1178
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,839
that i'm not seeing so like the level

1179
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,960
twos and threes

1180
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,680
we need more of those and it's very

1181
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,640
difficult for you

1182
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,359
to do your day-to-day job at a sysadmin

1183
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,359
and do security admin

1184
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,280
to the best of your ability in both

1185
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,880
worlds you're not going to be able to do

1186
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,240
that so something has to give you can

1187
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,400
only juggle so many balls before some

1188
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,520
fall

1189
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,280
i am shocked that you can't fix things

1190
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,359
with policy shocked

1191
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,040
what's the same users don't do that

1192
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,240
they're totally not going to do it are

1193
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,040
they

1194
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,050
one last round of applause for jess

1195
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,939
[Applause]

1196
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,319
