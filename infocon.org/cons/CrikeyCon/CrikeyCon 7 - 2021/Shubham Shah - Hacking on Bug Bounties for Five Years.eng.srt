uh you heard from a guy that that's

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,160
built one of the

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,080
the biggest companies in this space over

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,199
the last eight years and

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,599
in the journey he's been on um now we're

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,279
gonna hear it from the other side as a

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,080
guy who's

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,599
been hacking on stuff for the last five

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,280
years or so um and

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,120

um he's going to give us his side of the

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,480
story in the last five years of what

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,239
he's been doing thanks jobs

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,839
make him feel welcome

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,520
thanks for the kind welcome i guess um

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,559
i'll start off with

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,320
you know where everything started for me

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,760
for bug bounties

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
i come from humble beginnings my family

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,120
is an

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
immigrant family that moved to australia

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,719
in the year 2000

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,959
my father always invested in computers

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
even though he could barely afford it

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600
and i fell in love with hacking because

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,000
i

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
always lost at multiplayer games with my

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,080
brother he would beat me at

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
literally everything and i felt like i

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,159
was the worst at everything

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,400
so i decided that i'd look into hacking

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,759
and see how i could beat my brother in

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,000
these online games

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,840
through through that i kind of got into

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,360
application security and i started

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
realizing that that was a really big

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,560
passion of mine

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,520
um as a teenager as a kid and i've been

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,960
in the infosec industry for

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,040
officially for around six years now um

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,320
and i've worked at you know small

48
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,079
consulting firms i've worked at the big

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,479
four

50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,799
high-end consulting firms and now i've

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,000
started a a co-founded a startup

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,240
so when i was 14 i was working at hungry

53
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
jacks at western sydney

54
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,479
i was making 6.50 an hour i worked there

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,439
for eight months

56
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,640
and made around 800 i spent all my free

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,840
time hacking

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,399
i dreamt about an industry that existed

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,840
that i could use the application

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,439
security skills i picked up

61
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,960
hacking online games and other things

62
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
like that and at the time

63
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
i was submitting low-risk bugs to

64
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
paypal's bug bounty

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,640
so you know these first bugs that i

66
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,040
submitted were absolutely terrible

67
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,720
they frankly should not have even been

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
paid out for but

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
some of the bugs included things like

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,720
apache tomcat disclosure apache http

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,239
only cookie disclosure

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,200
ssl renegotiation vulnerabilities ssl 2

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
deprecated protocol

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
html forms with csrf protection things

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
that you might expect from a pen test

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,959
but not really a bug bounty in the

77
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,400
in this day and age at the time paypal

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
were really generous and they paid out

79
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,840
for some of these

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,519
i was just finding these through google

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,360
talking running scanners things like

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
that it was very low level i wasn't that

83
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
experienced

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
but i really loved application security

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
and that was i guess a constant

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
throughout my entire career

87
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,879
um so some of these bugs were paid out

88
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
some of these payouts were very small

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,640
but they made me realize that i could

90
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,319
get paid for hacking which was a

91
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,519
revelation to me

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
because at that point i didn't even know

93
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
that an infosec industry existed

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,239
this blew my mind as a 14 year old i

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,120
didn't even know

96
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,879
that an industry existed and it

97
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,879
motivated me to spend all my time

98
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,159
in learning more about application

99
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,959
security i worked really hard to get

100
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,280
into hall of fame pages and just getting

101
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
recognition because

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,319
i thought even getting recognized for

103
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,080
hacking was

104
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
mind-blowing at the time

105
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
so the first critical bug i found was an

106
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,440
ssrf vulnerability

107
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
in bill me later which is one of the

108
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,440
acquisitions of paypal

109
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
in this diagram it just kind of shows

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,959
you that there was this jsp page where

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,480
you could input a url

112
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
and that url was getting fetched by the

113
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
server and the contents were being

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
returned

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,239
the url that i used in this input was

116
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,280
business to

117
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
port 9080 which is obviously an internal

118
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,640
server

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,480
and it was returning the full response

120
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,560
of that url

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,239
i discovered this endpoint just by

122
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,920
google docking so nothing super

123
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,080
complicated or sophisticated

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
um but i did identify that this was an

125
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
ssrf vulnerability that should be

126
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,959
reported

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
so after that paypal paid me 1.5 k usd

128
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,639
and if you remember i worked eight

129
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
months at hungry jacks for just 800

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
so i quit my job at hungry jax i never

131
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,840
showed up again

132
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,160
so before you start hunting um there's a

133
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,199
couple of things that

134
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,120
i kind of want to get clear around bug

135
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
bounty hunting and that's

136
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
the fact that your application security

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,000
skills must be sharp

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
um it's not something that you can jump

139
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,919
into unless you have dedicated at least

140
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,040
some time

141
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,880
at honing your application security

142
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
skills and understanding how

143
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
web attacks cloud attacks or even binary

144
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,560
exploitation may work

145
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
to a decent extent most bug bounties

146
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,560
are in web applications that is changing

147
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,320
we are seeing cryptocurrencies we are

148
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,040
seeing

149
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
more bug bounties with binaries that you

150
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,240
can exploit um

151
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,840
but you know even web application

152
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,320
security is a huge field to navigate

153
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,240
there's client side issues server side

154
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
issues cloud platform specific issues

155
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,320
and they all must be studied before

156
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
approaching bug bounties uh

157
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
in a broader sense you can look at

158
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,360
some free resources like website academy

159
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,400
from portswigger

160
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
or you can take a look at pentester lab

161
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
if you want to look at some paid courses

162
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,800
that might help you in

163
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
in your journey

164
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,840
another thing that's really important in

165
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
bug bounties and has been a constant

166
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,600
throughout my career in bug bounties is

167
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,560
the fact of writing high quality reports

168
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
the better your report is and the more

169
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
time you spent at trying to explain

170
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,919
something as

171
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,400
elegantly as possible the less time it's

172
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
going to take the company or the triager

173
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
to understand what you're talking about

174
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
and therefore it's going to be something

175
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
that they would be willing to reward you

176
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,479
more money for because of the time saved

177
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,759
so most reports kind of follow a general

178
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,840
outline of having a summary steps to

179
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,919
reproduce supporting materials

180
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,400
and most importantly the impact the

181
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,680
impact is probably where you should

182
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,960
spend most of your time

183
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
both in the contents of the report but

184
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,000
also proving it

185
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
and that's how you will get the most

186
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
money out of your bug bounty reports

187
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,880
so 2015 that's kind of when i got

188
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,520
started

189
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,639
and getting into bug bounties it can be

190
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,800
pretty daunting i'm not going to lie

191
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,080
like bug bounties can

192
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,560
look as if they're impossible to get

193
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,440
initially

194
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,039
but i did find some things that helped

195
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,199
me significantly in this process

196
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
one of them was having a friend that you

197
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,319
could compete with

198
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,479
and be highly productive with as you

199
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,400
motivate each other in finding bugs

200
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
and comparing which bugs you find

201
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
another thing was setting healthy goals

202
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,160
like for example one bug a week or month

203
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,280
that could be a really good way at

204
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,360
committing to find bugs initially

205
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
and it was really important to build

206
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
your rep and profile on bug bounty

207
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,479
platforms as

208
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
in the future that proved to be very

209
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
important in getting invites

210
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,639
to private programs and things like that

211
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,240
um the other message i really want to

212
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,680
get across is there's so much

213
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
low-hanging fruit out there

214
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,440
um there is literally low hanging fruit

215
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
everywhere i look

216
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
still today and i highly recommend

217
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,319
getting into bug bounties if you're

218
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,000
scared about it or if you don't think

219
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,520
you can find stuff i

220
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,039
just recommend you be persistent and

221
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,919
give it a good shot

222
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
so some of the first bugs that i

223
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,479
reported were to uh

224
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,639
yeah were things like exposed reader

225
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,080
server got 500

226
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,199
for that just used netcat to look at

227
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,000
that and

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,759
look at what was coming back i used the

229
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,599
info command on readers to see what came

230
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,319
back

231
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,000
i could do things like list or keys and

232
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,759
values dos the machine

233
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,120
second order attacks by setting

234
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,440
malicious values it's pretty low level

235
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,120
bug but i'm just getting started in bug

236
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
bounties to set the scene so these

237
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,919
aren't going to be anything super

238
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,680
spectacular but i just want to prove to

239
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,319
you

240
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,160
that this is the sort of stuff you can

241
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
find on attack surfaces and bug bounties

242
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,319
probably still today another one was

243
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,360
exposed ha proxy statistics so another

244
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,919
easy bug got paid out 500

245
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,319
a pretty simple process i ran nmap

246
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,520
across all the assets

247
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
found an open port that looked pretty

248
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,800
dodgy

249
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,639
looked at that open port saw that it was

250
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
disclosing some information

251
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,199
and submitted a report around how that

252
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
shouldn't have been disclosed and how

253
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,919
you could potentially dos the system

254
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,759
through a cve as well

255
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
so very easy to report just getting

256
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
started in bug bounties this is the sort

257
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,240
of things you can be looking for

258
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
then i reported some open administration

259
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,919
interfaces

260
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,599
you know sometimes programs accept this

261
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,760
sometimes they don't it's all a guessing

262
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,519
game to understand what a program really

263
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,039
does accept until

264
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,519
you start submitting it more often so

265
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,880
they paid out 500

266
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
for this and they you know accepted that

267
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,720
bug but immediately after

268
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
i i was like okay i found one instance

269
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
so i'm going to report

270
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
every instance i find as found as a

271
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,760
separate report

272
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,519
so i tried being a little cheeky and you

273
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,640
can see that they closed it as

274
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,839
duplicates

275
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,279
so something that's a bit tricky with

276
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,959
bug bounties is you don't really know

277
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
whether or not a company prefers having

278
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,640
everything in separate reports

279
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,480
or they prefer having a single report

280
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
with everything grouped together

281
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,399
some bug bounty hunters will exploit the

282
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,680
fact that there is

283
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
multiple instances of something and

284
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
report them in separate reports

285
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,040
so they get a higher payout and more

286
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
reputation but this isn't always the way

287
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,320
to go

288
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,640
um this sometimes is acceptable for some

289
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
programs sometimes not for others

290
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
so i tried my luck here and they closed

291
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,160
them all as duplicates of the first

292
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
issue that i reported

293
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
um and you know i thought that i was

294
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
still adding value to their defense in

295
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,000
depth and getting paid

296
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
for it and doing all of this so i just

297
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,320
want to demonstrate

298
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,000
it's my first year in buck bounties i

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,480
still found a lot of low-risk bugs

300
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,160
i was just getting into bug bounties i

301
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,839
wasn't an expert at them

302
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,519
i wasn't finding really critical stuff

303
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,279
but here's an example of some of the

304
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,040
low-risk bugs i was finding

305
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,279
open administration interfaces reflected

306
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,640
cross-site scripting

307
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,160
information disclosure url redirection

308
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,560
and things like that but you can see

309
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,480
there's these payout values still aren't

310
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,200
that bad

311
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,760
for these low-risk bugs so i highly

312
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
recommend you know when you're starting

313
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
not probably setting the bar too high

314
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,880
for yourself but just committing to

315
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
finding bugs in general

316
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
that will be better for you in the long

317
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,000
run because you will eventually

318
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
find more high-risk bugs and you'll see

319
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,920
that in the evolution and progress i've

320
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
made over the last five years

321
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,560
so another concept i want to explain is

322
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,839
high payouts

323
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
doesn't necessarily mean that the bug is

324
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
complex or hard to exploit

325
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,000
in this example there was a subdomain

326
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
hijacking bug

327
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,079
where you could hijack cdn.company.com

328
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,560
through something called high wind cdn

329
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,399
now the only special thing about this

330
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
report was i literally got on the phone

331
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,920
with high winds and said that i really

332
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
needed this subdomain

333
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
um and i convinced them to give me this

334
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,279
subdomain and register it

335
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
so that it would redirect to my domain

336
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,200
that little bit of extra effort

337
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
and that little bit of persistence is

338
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
what led to this payout of 7.5 k

339
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,079
i'm sure many other bug bounty hunters

340
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,760
came across this subdomain

341
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
and thought that i can't take this over

342
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
because high winds doesn't have a sign

343
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
up form or i can't sign up to high winds

344
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
over the internet

345
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
it just required a little bit more of a

346
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,399
little bit of human interaction to

347
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
convince them to give me that asset

348
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
and eventually i got paid out a decent

349
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
bug bounty for it and this is still in

350
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
my first year of bug bounties so it just

351
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,480
shows

352
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,880
how far persistence can take you in this

353
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,560
um another thing that i want to show is

354
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,600
how many bugs that i had closed as n a

355
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
so as you start off in bug bounties

356
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,880
you're going to find things that you

357
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,720
think is a security issue

358
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,240
but when you submit it to the company

359
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
they respond in a sense that this is not

360
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
a security risk for us

361
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,920
and you've just got to accept that

362
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,079
that's um that's kind of the byproduct

363
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,920
of bug bounties you get paid

364
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,839
only when something has a real security

365
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,040
impact to a company

366
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
and the company gets to decide what has

367
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,399
a security impact not yourself

368
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
so the retrospective of 2015 is that you

369
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
know competition between other bug

370
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,279
bounty hunters facilitated growth

371
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,200
having the right mindset and coming up

372
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,959
with logical plans and executing them

373
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,320
led to success

374
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,639
low hanging fruit is everywhere you can

375
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
capitalize on this

376
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,320
for me bug bounties were pretty

377
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
addictive they caused a rush of

378
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,600
happiness and

379
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
that's something that i've always been

380
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,880
chasing over the last five years

381
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
and reporting low to medium bugs is

382
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
absolutely fine i was just happy that

383
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,399
companies recognized

384
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,040
my work and paid out for my bug reports

385
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
the impact determines the payout

386
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
so simple bugs can be very impactful and

387
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,880
be awarded a large amount of money

388
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,959
so moving on to 2016 to 2018

389
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,880
where there was a particular focus on

390
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
techniques

391
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
i got my feet wet in bug bounties and i

392
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,000
focused on techniques which could

393
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
amplify my severity of bugs that and the

394
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
payouts i was receiving

395
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
um this required me to be a little bit

396
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
more creative i had to identify weak

397
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
spots and attack surfaces

398
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
and i had to be able to target certain

399
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,639
companies for these weak spots

400
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,040
i shifted my focus a little bit i was

401
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,639
spending a lot of time on client-side

402
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,000
issues in the first year that i was

403
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,360
doing bug bounties

404
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,000
i realized that i could be focusing

405
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
purely on server-side issues

406
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,079
so that i could be increasing impact and

407
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,519
you know some people have different

408
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,120
strategies this was my strategy at the

409
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,600
time focusing on server-side issues

410
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
um and throughout this evolution um

411
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,399
a key factor as i've mentioned multiple

412
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,399
times already was persistence in

413
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,480
executing ideas

414
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
open mind is necessary to come up with

415
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,079
ideas and

416
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,440
you may or may not know that they're

417
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,639
going to work so you just have to really

418
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,680
believe in yourself

419
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,519
and believe that it's possible to

420
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,880
execute some of these ideas

421
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,279
so one of the bugs that i found during

422
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,560
this period was

423
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,959
uh it it required multiple multiple

424
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,279
steps to victory i can think of at least

425
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,120
seven steps that were required to get to

426
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
this point the

427
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,800
bug's title was ability to write

428
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,360
arbitrary scripts to this subdomain

429
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,680
through a misconfigured s3 bucket and it

430
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,519
was pretty wild like i started on the

431
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,720
company's blog site

432
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,320
and then i went from there to a

433
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,720
javascript file from a javascript file

434
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,160
to another api endpoint api endpoint

435
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,639
found

436
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,199
another configuration file in there i

437
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,720
found an s3 bucket

438
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
and then finally i was able to write

439
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,600
arbitrary files to this s3 bucket which

440
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
was being used elsewhere

441
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,000
you can see that i could have stopped at

442
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,519
any stage of this process

443
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,440
i could have stopped when i had found

444
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
just the blog i could have stopped when

445
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,639
i found the second subdomain

446
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,320
i could have stopped when i found the

447
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,639
second api but it was really important

448
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,320
to follow it through

449
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,120
there sometimes is sometimes you do need

450
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,440
to

451
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,079
perform multiple steps to to get to

452
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:48,959
victory

453
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,279
um sometimes digging deep leads to gold

454
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
um another thing that i did during this

455
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,720
period of time was

456
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,199
second order takeovers so for example

457
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,720
let's say your company uses something

458
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,279
like

459
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,079
sas service one and embeds content from

460
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,680
that service across your blog

461
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,519
and things like that you've registered

462
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,000
an account on this third party service

463
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
and the urls look something like this

464
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,079
where it's embedding a random id but

465
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,560
your account username is included there

466
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
but your company decides to stop using

467
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,320
this service one day and they delete

468
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,360
their accounts

469
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
from that from that system what happens

470
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
to all the embedded links that are

471
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
present in all of the blog posts what

472
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,120
happens if an attacker

473
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,959
registers the same username that you

474
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,959
used to have on this service

475
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
well in that scenario you can take over

476
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,959
partial contents of a page

477
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
and this is something that i've referred

478
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
to as second order takeovers

479
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
um so i've reported a bunch of these

480
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,240
over the years and it's usually led to

481
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,120
good payouts

482
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
um in this example you can see that i

483
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
was paid out two and a half grand

484
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
for reporting takeovers for a service

485
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
called wufoo which is

486
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,240
embedding forms into pages i could take

487
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,519
over all the forms

488
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,959
so i could make them malicious and i

489
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,399
could say you know submit your username

490
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,440
and password

491
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,160
instead of a real legitimate form

492
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,240
so another thing that's uh really

493
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,279
important

494
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,519
in bug bounties is really looking at the

495
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,959
scope and seeing what the company is

496
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,160
interested in

497
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,000
sometimes you'll find that companies are

498
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,639
interested in any asset owned by them to

499
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,519
be in scope

500
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,759
so for example uber might be interested

501
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,839
in any asset on the internet owned by

502
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,639
uber

503
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,199
which is a really big deal because you

504
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,959
know some of these companies

505
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,360
they operate in almost every country in

506
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,160
the world

507
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,880
and surely some of these countries may

508
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,639
have different processes

509
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,800
policies and procedures when it comes to

510
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,639
developing applications and deploying

511
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,839
them on the internet

512
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,120
so the hypothesis was um if if there's a

513
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,279
huge conglomerate or a huge company like

514
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,199
uber which is operating in so many

515
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,160
countries

516
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
maybe they don't have such a tight

517
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
security

518
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,759
culture in some of these other countries

519
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,199
and they push out code

520
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,800
that might be more vulnerable than

521
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
what's coming out of their primary

522
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,599
operations locations

523
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,240
so it's all about finding weaknesses and

524
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,199
blind spots

525
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,319
in the attack surface

526
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
so in this example i tried finding

527
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,400
assets for each country in the world for

528
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,039
my target until i landed on mexico

529
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,039
and there was a number of assets that

530
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,559
belong to a company i was targeting that

531
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,240
were built by some web developer

532
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,079
contractors in mexico

533
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,439
the only reason i know that is because

534
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,919
the company told me that afterwards

535
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,520
these assets were running on

536
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,200
applications specifically made for the

537
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,320
mexican market

538
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
there were certain tax laws and certain

539
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
things that you needed to

540
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,080
abide to in mexico that required this

541
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
custom application to be made

542
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
there was almost nothing linking back

543
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
the parent organization and these assets

544
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,600
together

545
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,760
things like the whois information server

546
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
location infrastructure

547
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
code app stack everything was different

548
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,840
except for the css styling

549
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,080
and that was how i identified it it was

550
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,160
through the css styling itself

551
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,559
that i found a pattern across the

552
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,520
internet

553
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,160
and that's how i identified these assets

554
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,440
i found a reference

555
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,280
from the parent organization also

556
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,039
linking to this micro site

557
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,200
that was that that was built for the

558
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,320
mexican market

559
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,080
and this was enough confirmation for me

560
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
to start hacking on it

561
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
however you can also confirm this with

562
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,640
the program before you start doing that

563
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,679
so all the pages were in spanish and

564
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,120
this was made specifically for the

565
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
mexican market but it was vulnerable to

566
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,559
all sorts of things

567
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,559
really simple sql injection payload

568
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,640
where i could sleep for 20 seconds

569
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
it was rewarded 5 000 it was really easy

570
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,840
bug

571
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
but it was all about the idea of coming

572
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,960
up with concepts

573
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
for example there might be weaker

574
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,559
applications in different countries

575
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,840
and following through with those

576
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,199
concepts until completion

577
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,200
another example is i was targeting a

578
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,559
large gaming company

579
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,120
and i found they had specific android

580
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
applications for brazilian users

581
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,440
so this triggered my curiosity again and

582
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
i downloaded the apk file

583
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,720
reverse engineered it to discover the

584
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,559
api endpoints it was calling

585
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
and i found that there was an api

586
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,600
endpoint which would retrieve your

587
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,039
user's details

588
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,160
api v1 slash users slash your id

589
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,640
i simply changed this to slash users

590
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,840
page equals one

591
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,760
and it returned the full details of all

592
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,960
users registered

593
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,679
there was 111 000 users registered and

594
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,039
all of that data could have been leaked

595
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,320
through this vulnerability

596
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,559
it was rewarded seven grand now again

597
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,240
this is a concept where we've just

598
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,679
followed through the idea that

599
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,960
potentially there are weaker

600
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,559
applications in different countries for

601
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,840
these organizations

602
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,440
and we've proven this concept time and

603
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
time again

604
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,559
um another great thing to look at is

605
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,080
third-party platforms

606
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
so what do i mean by that i mean a

607
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
third-party platform is anything like

608
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,080
github

609
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,880
gitlab bitbucket anything that's outside

610
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,080
of your company but

611
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,919
still used by your company it's a third

612
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,320
party even things like servicenow where

613
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,679
you may have all your knowledge base

614
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,799
articles or

615
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
an atlassian product where you may have

616
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,360
your internal documentation and tickets

617
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,000
i look for these i look for exposures

618
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
through these platforms all the time for

619
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,960
my targets

620
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
and i'll often find things like secrets

621
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
on github or gitlab or bitbucket or i

622
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,039
might find things on servicenow or i

623
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,480
might find things on some atlassian

624
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,280
products

625
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
another creative example is webex i'm

626
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
sure many of the companies you've

627
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,760
maybe worked for might have interacted

628
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,240
with have used something like webex

629
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,799
turns out a lot of people don't disable

630
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,640
anonymous access on webex

631
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,039
so if you just put in the

632
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,080
company.webex.com you can start looking

633
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,600
through all of the calendars you can

634
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,000
start

635
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,880
joining events if you wish so i got paid

636
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,840
out 500

637
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,280
as well so that was a really easy bug

638
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,360
an example in third party platforms i

639
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
came across this source code

640
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,400
which was for dropbox.company.com and it

641
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
had credentials for an ftp server

642
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,919
this ftp server credentials were valid i

643
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,000
was able to log into the ftp server

644
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
able to upload some files that led to

645
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,320
persistent xss through flash but one

646
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
thing we can be sure of is we can be

647
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
thankful for the fact that flash is dead

648
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,799
today

649
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,080
so this wouldn't have been possible in

650
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,440
this day and age for all the modern

651
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,919
browsers

652
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,240
another really cool thing to look at is

653
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,640
dangling ip subdomain takeovers

654
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,600
so when an ec2 instance gets started it

655
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,440
gets assigned an elastic ip

656
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,400
amazon aws manages a huge address space

657
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,080
including all the elastic ips that are

658
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,679
assigned to instances

659
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,600
in many cases subdomains might be

660
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,679
pointing to an elastic ip

661
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,159
to an ec2 instance but what happens when

662
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,400
that ec2 instance is destroyed

663
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,559
that elastic ip gets released in the

664
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,400
pool and someone else can claim that ip

665
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,919
at random

666
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,440
so what happens to the subdomains that

667
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
are pointing to these elastic ips

668
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
well most likely the dns records haven't

669
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
been removed and this is a huge

670
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
problem that we see again and again day

671
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,720
in day out

672
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
in this day and age so someone else can

673
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,880
potentially control the full contents of

674
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,799
those subdomains as long as they own the

675
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,640
elastic ip those subdomains are pointing

676
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,440
to

677
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
this was a technique that i employed

678
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
during this period of time and it's

679
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,200
something that i still employ today

680
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,320
in fact something that i'm looking

681
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,039
further and further into

682
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,200
so you can detect this in multiple ways

683
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,360
um back then what i used to do is i used

684
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,480
to rely on things like

685
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
ssl certificates i used to rely on the

686
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,400
contents of the page

687
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,120
there's no aws api that lets you easily

688
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,080
detect this

689
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
i've literally had dreams where i've

690
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,120
come like i found this magical aws api

691
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,440
that lets me detect this and i've tried

692
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,960
everything as soon as i've woken up from

693
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,000
these dreams but

694
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,520
that's never really worked out and i

695
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
haven't found an aws api that even gives

696
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,200
a slight difference in response

697
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
or even has a slight timing difference

698
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,360
that will let you determine this

699
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,880
but there are still ways that you can do

700
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,559
this some bug bounty hunters are just

701
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,480
continuously claiming elastic ips from

702
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,200
the pool

703
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
checking it with their passive dns data

704
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,480
and seeing whether or not it points to

705
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,919
any domains that they're interested

706
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,120
in i often report bug bounties i often

707
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,799
report bugs to bounties

708
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,200
on this and i get paid out sometimes a

709
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
really low amount like 100

710
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,559
sometimes really high amount like a

711
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,559
thousand dollars depends how much

712
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,919
companies care about this and whether or

713
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,240
not there is real impact but this is a

714
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,520
technique that i've been employing for

715
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,400
quite some time now

716
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
so here's an example of a report where

717
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,640
i've reported dangling ip subdomain

718
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
takeover

719
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,000
i just tell them that look i can see

720
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,679
that there's this subdomain pointing to

721
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,039
this ip address

722
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,039
i can see when you visit this ip address

723
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,799
it returns an application that's

724
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,280
nowhere near related to your company and

725
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,039
returns an ssl certificate that's not

726
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,080
your company's

727
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,840
this is most likely an elastic ip

728
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
takeover please take a look at it please

729
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,120
get rid of the record

730
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
and that's how i write reports when i

731
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,360
haven't claimed the ip myself

732
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,279
this sometimes gets paid out as i said i

733
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,400
got paid out 100

734
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,240
for this one

735
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,279
so the retrospective for 2016 to 2018

736
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,360
is i'm still finding low-hanging fruit

737
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
i'm not like i'm not doing anything

738
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,360
super complicated to find these bugs

739
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
there's still a lot of low-hanging fruit

740
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,760
out there but what was important was the

741
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,039
growing process of

742
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,559
really coming up with ideas and

743
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,039
following through with execution

744
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,960
some creativity is required but it's

745
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,520
totally worth it when you do it

746
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
i stopped focusing on client side issues

747
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
as much and really focus on server-side

748
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,240
issues

749
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,360
and somewhat cloud-based issues as well

750
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
persistence was still key in finding all

751
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,799
these security issues

752
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,240
often bugs were found after a

753
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,080
complicated chain of events

754
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,720
and a lot of time was spent mapping

755
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,679
attack surfaces

756
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
in different regions and countries like

757
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,600
the two examples i gave you in this

758
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,320
period of time

759
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,720
so moving on to 2018 to 2021

760
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
i want to talk about three things i want

761
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,080
to talk about reconnaissance

762
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
and what that means to me idols as a

763
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,760
systematic problem and some bug bounties

764
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,799
and zero days as not taboo but something

765
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,960
that you might want to start looking for

766
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,799
if you're interested in finding bugs in

767
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,720
bounties but also reverse engineering

768
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,279
things and

769
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,640
in your free time so

770
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,120
in this year and in these couple of

771
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
years

772
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,000
recon was something that had become

773
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,440
second nature to me due to how

774
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
repetitive the process was

775
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
and i really got to the point where i

776
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,279
needed to define what recon meant to me

777
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,159
because

778
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
so many hackers think about recon in a

779
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,919
different way to what i really thought

780
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,880
of recon

781
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,960
and i tried not to deviate from my

782
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
processes related to reconnaissance

783
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,880
i found systematic issues in bug

784
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,720
bounties and exploited them for a steady

785
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,279
train of bounties and high severity bugs

786
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,960
identified weaknesses and attack

787
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
surfaces holistically

788
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,559
and that was what led to success there

789
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
was a shift

790
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,080
of focus to source code analysis to find

791
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,520
zero-day vulnerabilities in vendor

792
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,240
products

793
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,840
that were used by companies running bug

794
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,720
bounty programs

795
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,960
so defining reconnaissance i look at

796
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,919
reconnaissance

797
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,440
in this sort of way where there's

798
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,279
breadth and there's depth

799
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,520
breath you're going far and wide depth

800
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,880
you're going deep into it

801
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,799
so in breath you've got an example like

802
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,640
enumerating all subdomains

803
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
enumerating all endpoints enumerating

804
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,000
all cloud resources

805
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
finding related domains like

806
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
acquisitions and subsidiaries looking at

807
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,279
third-party platforms like github and

808
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,320
bitbucket

809
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,080
but depth is where you really start

810
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,159
looking deeply into the applications

811
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,559
or systems that a company has you might

812
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,840
start doing things like reverse

813
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
engineering the javascript

814
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,200
you might discover and test all the

815
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
request parameters

816
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,320
you'll test for things like route 53

817
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,559
takeovers and elastic ip takeovers

818
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,240
you'll detect all technologies and

819
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,080
versions across an attack surface

820
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,240
and you'll analyze code and public repos

821
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,360
written by the org

822
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,760
or employees of that organization so you

823
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,480
can see how

824
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
the way i define recon is in this

825
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,760
breadth and depth

826
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,320
approach and i make sure that i do both

827
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,400
of these elements as much as possible

828
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
i might find a list of a thousand sub

829
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,919
domains when i'm performing the breadth

830
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,120
side of reconnaissance

831
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,360
but i'll be surely reversing the engine

832
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,640
i'll be reverse engineering the

833
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,720
javascript on as many as possible

834
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,559
to achieve the depth component of

835
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,760
reconnaissance

836
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,440
but this is how i see reconnaissance and

837
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
this is how i wish more people

838
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,120
saw it and approached it because i think

839
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
reconnaissance is quite a large thing to

840
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,919
approach

841
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,000
and it's such a broad term that in our

842
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,760
industry has somewhat

843
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,039
not been defined so well

844
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,200
so how does someone perform recon well

845
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
really it's just a matter of putting the

846
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,440
time in recon is really time consuming

847
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
but it can lead to some great bugs being

848
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,559
found

849
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,080
following the concepts of breadth and

850
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,440
depth you should always be asking

851
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,520
yourself can i take this concept further

852
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,960
can i go deeper

853
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
and you should follow your hunches and

854
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,480
build up your instinct to get a better

855
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,279
indication

856
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,480
of when something may lead to

857
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,200
vulnerabilities i spend a lot of time

858
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,080
reverse entering javascript these days

859
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,159
often to find endpoints parameters

860
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
expected values and schemas

861
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
so idols one of my favorite programs to

862
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,200
hack on is uber

863
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,320
they represent everything as uuids a

864
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
uuid is a random string of a certain

865
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,799
length and it looks something like this

866
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,279
things like user ids vehicle ids

867
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,480
restaurant ids

868
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
everything on uber that could be an id

869
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
is a uuid

870
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
i reported a lot of access control

871
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
vulnerabilities to uber from 2018 to

872
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,320
2821

873
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,760
and some of these vulnerabilities were

874
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,919
as simple as putting someone else's uuid

875
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,120
instead of mine

876
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,279
some bugs were more impactful than

877
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,960
others

878
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
so my favorite bug in uber was where i

879
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,080
could

880
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,399
obtain the uuid of any restaurant on

881
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,000
ubereats that i wanted to test the bug

882
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,559
on

883
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,919
so i could just click on the restaurant

884
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,279
when i was on ubereats and it would give

885
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,520
me the uuid and the url

886
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,080
you can see it's bold in this slide and

887
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,919
once you've obtained the uuid we can

888
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,720
move to the next step of the exploit but

889
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,399
really i just want to preface this as

890
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,919
like this was one of my least

891
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,520
favorite restaurants that i tested this

892
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,279
bug on so

893
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,960
i wasn't too worried about this bug

894
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,640
actually working but

895
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,120
this is what the request looked like you

896
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,279
could send a request to

897
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,520
restaurantoruba.com

898
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,960
and you could say that this restaurant

899
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,399
is closing early and it's going to

900
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,240
expire at this certain date

901
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,960
you can see that i've put us their uuid

902
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,200
instead of my restaurant's uuid

903
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,000
and then in response it's currently

904
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,039
unavailable

905
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,360
so i didn't expect it to actually work

906
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,200
um didn't like the kebabs that much so

907
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,080
it's okay

908
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,360
but i reported the bug asap this was

909
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,440
probably my favorite bug they paid out

910
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,679
something like eight grand for it

911
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,399
so what that was just one of the many

912
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,600
bugs in uber

913
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,039
that were idol bugs it was a systematic

914
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,840
pro systemic problem for uber

915
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,120
this is something that you can still

916
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
find bugs in uber today

917
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
where you replace a uuid that's not

918
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
yours it's someone else's

919
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,399
and i consider these bugs as low hanging

920
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,320
fruit it wasn't too difficult to just

921
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,799
replace my uuid with someone else's

922
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,320
i just had to understand this is how the

923
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,480
business logic of the application works

924
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,760
and i should try and test the

925
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,600
authorization that's put in there

926
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,039
to see whether or not it's implemented

927
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,640
correctly

928
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,600
a lot of my bugs from 2018 to 2021 were

929
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,320
bugs like this

930
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,159
and moving on to zero days i spend quite

931
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,919
a lot of time finding vulnerabilities in

932
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,279
things like vendor software

933
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,640
so we're thinking about things like

934
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,399
oracle e-business suite

935
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,120
web sphere jira confluence secure file

936
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,399
transfer software

937
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,000
and then things like django python

938
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,080
libraries for example there's still a

939
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,559
sql injection and django hvac which is

940
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,640
still unpatched if you're looking for it

941
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,919
and there's a cloud conf

942
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,520
all the cloud configuration issues in

943
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,200
aws that

944
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,559
you know may or may not be considered

945
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,840
zero days but they're still very

946
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,559
important to look into

947
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,679
i did a lot of this work in source code

948
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,320
analysis

949
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,080
and reverse engineering and finding zero

950
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,679
days not only because

951
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,840
i could use it in bug bounties to report

952
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,000
bugs and these software that companies

953
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,960
were using

954
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,799
but also because it has a huge role in

955
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,200
my current role at asset note where we

956
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,720
detect these vulnerabilities before

957
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,320
anything else does

958
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,880
as quickly as possible so it kind of had

959
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,080
a

960
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
two different use cases for me in

961
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760
looking in this sort of stuff but

962
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,440
what i can say is at the end of the

963
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,840
journey like the tricky part about

964
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,320
finding zero days in vendor software is

965
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,159
not the actual process of finding the

966
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:12,960
zero day

967
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,880
it's being able to actually find a copy

968
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,480
of the software in the first place to

969
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,399
install on a server

970
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,640
so the barrier of entry though is not as

971
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,519
bad these days

972
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,200
because you can use things like azure

973
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,519
and aws marketplace to deploy vendor

974
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,399
applications

975
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,960
without forking huge license fees and

976
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,039
then you can then perform static source

977
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,799
code analysis

978
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,840
with things like jd gui or pro scion

979
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,880
decompiler

980
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
if it's java and you can start looking

981
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
for vulnerabilities

982
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,840
a lot of vendors are simply banking on

983
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,120
the fact that you won't be able to

984
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,559
discover software vulnerabilities

985
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,840
because you don't have a copy of the

986
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,559
software

987
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,320
or you can't be bothered to spin up a

988
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
copy of their software on whatever

989
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
provider the biggest barrier of finding

990
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,559
vulnerabilities in enterprise software

991
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:54,799
is

992
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,399
actually getting the software itself

993
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,159
so the retrospective from 2018 to 2021

994
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,159
was i took a breadth and depth approach

995
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,240
to all recon performed ensuring i was

996
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,840
leaving no stone unturned

997
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,360
i exploited a wide range of idle

998
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,960
vulnerabilities on bug mounted programs

999
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,240
like uber

1000
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,320
where things like uuids were being used

1001
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,760
and analyzed the range of vendor

1002
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,360
software and middleware to find zero

1003
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,919
days

1004
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,279
and report vulnerabilities and bug

1005
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,200
bounties and ultimately the vendors

1006
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,440
this was really effective as well and

1007
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,880
reported a lot of cloud security

1008
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,039
misconfiguration issues particularly for

1009
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,080
aws environments

1010
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,600
so the last thing i'll leave you guys

1011
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,919
with is just some further reading

1012
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,880
i've documented all of this process and

1013
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,640
my journey in bug bounties

1014
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
at these two links hacking on bug

1015
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,919
bounties for four years in high

1016
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,679
frequency security bug hunting

1017
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,760
but i also want to just quickly mention

1018
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,480
the fact of imposter syndrome

1019
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,399
everyone has it even i have it and it's

1020
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,840
something that you know last year in

1021
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
october

1022
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,840
you can see how i had this huge slump i

1023
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
couldn't find any bugs for a couple of

1024
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,399
months

1025
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,840
and then i finally got back into it

1026
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,960
again and i have this really weird cycle

1027
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,039
when it comes to hacking when i find

1028
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,559
bugs and i'm finding all these bugs and

1029
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,080
submitting it to bounties i feel like

1030
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,679
i'm an amazing hacker

1031
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,919
but as soon as i've done that maybe two

1032
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,760
weeks after i feel like i can't hack

1033
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,919
anything if my life depended on it

1034
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,000
so this is a continuous cycle that i go

1035
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,519
through in and out so if anyone is

1036
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,679
dealing with imposter syndrome

1037
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,919
i can just say be persistent believe in

1038
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,600
yourself and keep on trying

1039
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
because i don't think that you're a

1040
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,519
terrible hacker i just think it can take

1041
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,200
some time to get back into it

1042
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,559
and it's a difficult thing to do in the

1043
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,480
first place to find bugs and bounties

1044
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,080
so that's it thanks everyone for coming

1045
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,530
to my talk really appreciate it

1046
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:46,670
[Applause]

1047
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,279
imposter syndrome is real ladies and

1048
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,279
gentlemen um there's a few hands up so

1049
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,000
we'll go that way

1050
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,360
first that was awesome i love watching

1051
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,640
these kind of um

1052
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,799
presentations just a quick question um

1053
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,600
before anyone goes and quits their job

1054
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,159
how how did you find your like obviously

1055
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,120
over time

1056
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,440
up and down what do you feel that your

1057
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,399
average kind of

1058
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,599
income stability was over over those

1059
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,159
years

1060
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,480
yeah so i think um so i can tell you the

1061
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,280
exact figures

1062
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,639
um this is something i've shared with

1063
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,480
other people as well in

1064
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,239
my whole bug-bounty career i've made

1065
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,520
close to 850

1066
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,639
000 uh dollars but i've worked

1067
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,040
in jobs in between all of that so i've

1068
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,839
i've

1069
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,679
as i said i worked at uh security

1070
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,839
consultancies i even co-founded a

1071
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,560
startup

1072
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,119
um what happened is eventually bug

1073
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,040
bounties became a lot easier to

1074
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,359
participate in initially i had to spend

1075
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,960
a really long amount of time

1076
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,280
to actually get good at bug bounties but

1077
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,440
nowadays i can probably spend three to

1078
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,800
four hours

1079
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
you know every couple of days or

1080
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
sometimes i won't hack anything for a

1081
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,239
month and then look at it really deeply

1082
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,040
for a week

1083
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,280
and still be very successful i think

1084
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,480
what ends up happening

1085
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,520
is you start building instinct really

1086
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
good instincts

1087
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,240
for when something may or may not be

1088
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,960
vulnerable so you spend a lot more time

1089
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,760
focusing uh on specific assets that you

1090
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,200
might think are vulnerable just based

1091
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,480
off your instincts

1092
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,000
so i think over time your experience

1093
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,839
increases and you can get more effective

1094
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,720
at earning it

1095
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,040
as kind of like a side job but initially

1096
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,800
there's a huge time investment required

1097
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,680
to get to that point

1098
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,240
hi in regards to the route 53

1099
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,320
vulnerabilities that you found did you

1100
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,880
try the bgp hijack

1101
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,359
um no i've never done bgp hijacking

1102
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,079
myself

1103
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,160
but um i'm not really sure if that would

1104
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,920
be accepted in bug bounties

1105
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
um would have to give it a shot that was

1106
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,359
going to be my next question can you

1107
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,240
report a

1108
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,839
bgp hijacker is a bug bounty

1109
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
you mentioned at the end there with the

1110
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,200
enterprise software stuff it's hard to

1111
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
get a copy of it before you can actually

1112
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,160
hack on it

1113
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,680
do you find through bug bounties that's

1114
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,960
becoming easier like they're actually

1115
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,480
putting their software up then for you

1116
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,000
guys to go have a crack at it

1117
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,599
some companies are doing that but it's

1118
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,200
not super common um

1119
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,440
i think that most enterprise software

1120
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
that i struggle to get today

1121
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,440
usually it's a really good indicator

1122
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,720
that you're gonna find some mad

1123
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,599
criticals

1124
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,680
if it's hard to get it's likely never

1125
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,079
been looked at by anyone else

1126
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,839
i'm just going to follow on from that

1127
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,359
too have you been reading euler's

1128
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,640
because i've seen some software that

1129
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,040
specifically says no reverse engineering

1130
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,960
i've probably broken all of those eulers

1131
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,880
at this point

1132
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
hey uh do you feel like it's a job or a

1133
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,119
hobby uh for me it's a hobby

1134
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,320
um definitely something i love doing

1135
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,599
um yeah i had a question and just wanted

1136
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,720
to

1137
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,440
call out as well i actually spoke at

1138
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,040
nalcon yesterday talking about the

1139
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,320
evolution of

1140
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,880
new uh research and attack classes and

1141
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,119
and credited you and naffi

1142
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,720
um around the uh the recon stuff because

1143
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,560
that's definitely a thing now like the

1144
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
internet's always had its ass hanging

1145
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,320
out but i didn't really realize that

1146
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
and then you guys went and basically you

1147
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,240
know i think set a whole bunch of stuff

1148
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,040
in motion

1149
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,440
um and asset notes part of that so you

1150
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,720
know props

1151
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
um but question for you was just um you

1152
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,560
know with with the different things that

1153
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,520
you've learned like how

1154
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,680
how much does that go to finding the

1155
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,079
particular types of bugs or the type of

1156
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,599
you know kill chain or whatever else

1157
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,920
that kind of most suits you like is

1158
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,040
there stuff that you

1159
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,400
just probably wouldn't hack because

1160
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,560
you're not interested um

1161
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
that's a pretty good question i think

1162
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,920
over time i have

1163
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,560
like a acquired a taste in certain

1164
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,320
softwares that are running or certain

1165
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,680
systems that are running

1166
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,640
for example i really enjoy hacking iis

1167
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,440
servers

1168
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,000
um done a lot of made a lot of content

1169
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,119
around it but

1170
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,960
things like um there's a big airline

1171
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,160
that uses iis

1172
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,040
and they award miles for all the bug

1173
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,920
bounties

1174
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,119
so one of my favorite platforms to hack

1175
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,520
on is

1176
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,359
that bug bounty and all of the iis

1177
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,720
servers that i've come across

1178
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,040
i've now come up with a methodology for

1179
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,160
iis servers that's

1180
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,200
highly effective almost all the time

1181
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,680
so i always enjoy doing that because i

1182
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,440
know it's going to lead to results

1183
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,240
sometimes more modern web technologies

1184
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,640
like

1185
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,960
you know if i'm targeting ruby on rails

1186
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
i don't enjoy that as much because i

1187
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,480
don't have such a great methodology

1188
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,040
there

1189
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,240
there's definitely things i could

1190
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,000
probably invest more time into to get

1191
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,119
better at

1192
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,640
but i think that's the process of just

1193
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,200
getting better over time

1194
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,000
hey sharbs um have you ever had recon

1195
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,160
failure where you've thought you're

1196
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,359
hacking the right

1197
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,520
target and actually you submitted this

1198
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,480
awesome bug

1199
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,079
and they actually go uh that doesn't

1200
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,520
belong to us

1201
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,200
um yeah i've had that for example um

1202
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,320
uh i found a server that had a moodle

1203
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,880
setup page and i thought that it was

1204
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,599
owned by that organization so i hacked

1205
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,640
all of it and i submitted it to them

1206
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,400
the way i hacked it by the way was using

1207
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
uh my sequel local

1208
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,680
uh file read through the setup stages

1209
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,839
if you can specify a mysql server you

1210
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,160
own you can then read arbitrary files

1211
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,320
and even perform ssrf on behalf of the

1212
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,119
server

1213
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,359
um so i used that i got access to it i

1214
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,560
submitted the bug and they were like

1215
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,320
yeah this is just an elastic ip that we

1216
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,520
no longer own

1217
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
so i i probably hacked some random

1218
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
person's moodle server

1219
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,000
um did the random person pay you no i

1220
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,880
got no no

1221
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,040
no payout for that thanks

1222
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,200
let's get another round of applause for

1223
