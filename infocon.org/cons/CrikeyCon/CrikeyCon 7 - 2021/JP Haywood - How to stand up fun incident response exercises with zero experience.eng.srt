um hi mum if you're there on the stream

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
um maybe not i don't know you probably

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,239
got better things to do

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,320
yeah yeah sure

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,760
um so today i'm going to talk about

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,920
incident response exercises

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,400
but before i start um if you guys are

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,920
watching outside there are still some

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,320
seats inside so come on through it'll

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
help me out a little bit

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,159
um and hopefully we're going to approach

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,600
this in a little bit of a different way

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,880
using some tools that are freely

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,720
available that i had nothing to do with

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,159
making

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,200
i've just stolen them and put them

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
together and i think it's kind of

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
interesting

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,079
so i'm going to share that with you guys

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,079
today

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
so a little bit about me

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,200
i'm an information security manager at

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
uh at a bank which is fun

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,799
uh and my responsibilities there include

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,240
managing the stock and the response

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,360
process

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,439
so you know we kind of do these things

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
fairly frequently

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,640
and also i'm a qualified incident

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
handler just in case you're wondering

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,159
a couple of disclaimers so

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,759
what we're going to go through today may

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,560
not be suitable for a board exercise

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
so if you want to present to the board

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,640
just have a little bit of a think first

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,000
depending on your board this might be

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
completely appropriate it might not be

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,000
and the other thing i wanted to point

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
out

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
these aren't the views of the place that

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,920
i work at they're just mine

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,040
so

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,160
you know

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
that's about that i think so why do we

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,920
want to do incident response well um

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
we've seen a lot of good talks today

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,400
about

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,720
all the things that can go wrong and

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
it's really good to be able to practice

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,840
the things so that they go right so by

74
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,080
practicing uh we can learn to deal with

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,160
these things when they happen we can

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,360
become like a crack response team

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,120
pretty good we know we're drilled we

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
know what to do we can go in we can get

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
the stuff that we need done

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
and

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
we can also look good

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,599
and hopefully we're going to have a

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,280
little bit of fun on the way while we're

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
doing it

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,519
so ultimately what we're going to be is

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,560
we're going to be looking out over the

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,480
enterprise as it's burning to the ground

88
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,680
and we're going to be the hero that

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,599
comes in and saves the day and hopefully

90
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,560
i'm going to give you some tools that

91
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
you can start doing that and be that

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
hero today

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
we'll see how we go though so the first

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
thing we're going to look at

95
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,200
is

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
gorillas in the nist

97
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,720
right

98
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,000
i thought it was pretty good come on

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,360
so nist 800-61r2

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,760
is um

101
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,879
a special publication from nist about

102
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
security instant incident handling

103
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,040
and in case you're wondering um they're

104
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
happy for you to use it

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,599
it's not copyrighted but they just like

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,440
you know a little bit of props

107
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,760
and attribution so thanks nist good job

108
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,120
so what we're going to do we're going to

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,480
use this thing and we're going to turn

110
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,200
you into a superhero incident response

111
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
type person

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
so a couple of things so first of all on

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,959
page 6

114
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,680
then this 861 is going to tell you what

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
you need to do

116
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,599
to set up your incident response process

117
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,200
why you need it

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
how to develop out your policies and

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,920
things like that what kind of team

120
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,680
structure you might need or that kind of

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,640
good stuff

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
i'm skipping ahead page 21 is also going

123
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,798
to talk about the incident response life

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
cycle so we're not going to dwell too

125
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
much on this today but be aware that

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
there is one if you're not generally

127
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
dealing with a response

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
and it's split into four parts prepare

129
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
detect and analyze containment

130
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
eradication recovery and your

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
post-incident activity so these

132
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,520
discussion exercises fit into that very

133
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,600
first box the prepare box and the better

134
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
you prepare the easier it is to do all

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,240
the other things down the track

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,880
on page 52 another important page in the

137
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,919
guide

138
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,520
is talking about your incident handling

139
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,960
scenarios so we'll talk a little bit

140
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
more about that later

141
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,360
so first thing in our superhero incident

142
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,240
response tabletop toolkit is nist 800 61

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
r2

144
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,560
cool so

145
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
we've got that what else do we need well

146
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
we need a bit of a plan

147
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
or a playbook so a plan is generally

148
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
like a high level

149
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,039
generic steps that you're going to

150
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,639
respond to an incident with whereas your

151
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,520
playbook is more specific for specific

152
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,720
scenarios so you might have one for

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,680
malware or ransomware or the ceos put

154
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
something silly on twitter or something

155
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
like that right

156
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
and guess what this 800-61r2 also tells

157
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,039
you what you need to do in an incident

158
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,800
so if you don't have a plan you can just

159
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
use the guide and it tells you step by

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,199
step at a fairly general level but

161
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,560
detailed enough to follow through what

162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,039
you need to do

163
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,039
so in our toolkit we have nist 800-61r2

164
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,520
the plan or our playbooks or you know if

165
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
you're just starting out like i said

166
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,800
this is for xero experience so if you

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
don't have anything you grab that for

168
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
your plan

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,639
what else do we need

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,960
so we need some kind of aim for our

171
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,880
exercise and objectives so what is it

172
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
that we're actually trying to achieve by

173
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
running these exercises and what are the

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
objectives that we want to hit as we're

175
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,880
running through them so the aim could be

176
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
that we want to test our new incident

177
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,319
response plan during a cyber incident

178
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,759
scenario

179
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,919
and we could have a set of objectives

180
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
that it could be that we want to review

181
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
our new plan

182
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
we want to identify if the plan is

183
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,560
missing any steps

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
we want to validate if the new plan is

185
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
appropriate for whatever scenario we

186
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,440
think they were going to use it for

187
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,479
now

188
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,080
if you want a little bit of help writing

189
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
your aim and objectives there's another

190
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,039
nist guide which is 800-84 that goes

191
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,520
through in about i know 70 or 90 pages

192
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
or something like that how to write out

193
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,160
all the exercises and things like that

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
but because we've only got a little

195
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
short period of time we're not going to

196
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,759
dive into that today

197
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,680
so back to our toolkit so that we can be

198
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,000
the superhero what have we got in there

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
so we've got nist we've got our plan or

200
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
a playbook or nist

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,440
we've written some aims and objectives

202
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
so we know what we're going to do what

203
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
we're going to get out of our exercise

204
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,400
and then we're going to start building

205
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,759
our team

206
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,880
so it might be pretty obvious you're

207
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
going to have your security guys right

208
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,000
but you've got to think about who else

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,759
might be on that team

210
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,120
so normally you start off you have your

211
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
core security guys that are doing the

212
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,639
incident response stuff day in day out

213
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,919
but then depending on the incident

214
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,280
you're going to start bringing

215
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
some people like system administrators

216
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,639
or network engineers

217
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
you might need to bring in your pr team

218
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
or your corporate comms or

219
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,720
maybe your risk advisors

220
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,479
or your compliance team or the legal

221
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,000
team and slowly

222
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
your team's actually getting quite big

223
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,120
and it's got people that aren't normally

224
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
in it and don't understand this stuff so

225
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
it can get a little bit tricky

226
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
and that's another really good reason to

227
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
practice and to practice with these

228
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,080
people so that when something happens

229
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,599
they know who you are

230
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,360
they understand the whole thing and what

231
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
they need to do

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
okay so we're getting there we're

233
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,360
building our toolkit out we have our

234
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,120
newest

235
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,160
800-6102 you guys are going to go to

236
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,199
sleep and you're going to be saying that

237
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,199
in your head all right

238
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,400
that's all right there'll be a link at

239
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,319
the end so you can find it in case you

240
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,160
forget we've got our plan or our

241
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,759
playbook

242
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,000
we've got our aims and objectives

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,599
we've got our team

244
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,800
all right what else what are we going to

245
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
get next

246
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
well next we need a scenario to actually

247
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,879
test the plan with

248
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,160
so there's a couple of ways of doing

249
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,919
this if you have time and you feel like

250
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,000
it you can write out your scenario

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
or as i kind of hinted at before

252
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,680
at the end of nist 800-61r2

253
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,199
there's a set of scenarios that you can

254
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,000
just take and use without even really

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
thinking about it

256
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,200
it's pretty cool

257
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
so we've got nist we've got our plan on

258
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,320
this we've got our aims and objectives

259
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
we've got our team ready to go we've got

260
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
our scenario ready to go or we're just

261
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
going to steal nists

262
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
what's next

263
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,040
okay you need a dice

264
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,480
hang on a minute

265
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,320
what

266
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,440
how's that going to help you also need

267
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
an it guru dungeon master type person as

268
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,080
well okay

269
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,680
here's where the fun starts happening

270
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,920
all right so you're starting to to break

271
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,519
out of it a little bit

272
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,040
so in our toolkit we've got this we've

273
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
got the plan we've got the aim

274
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,959
objectives team scenarios we've got a

275
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,519
dice we've got a dungeon master

276
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,600
and now we just need a game so that we

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
can help gamify our incident response

278
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,760
drills and have a little bit of fun but

279
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
at the same time learn lots and lots

280
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,279
so

281
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,200
uh black hills infosec have made this

282
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
game called cubicles and compromises

283
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,480
it's kind of like a dungeons and dragons

284
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
for incident response

285
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,040
like i said it's up there it's on the

286
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
internet it's really available to use

287
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,279
they've done a really good job so we're

288
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,279
going to use that with our nist and

289
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,399
they're the two things that we're going

290
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,200
to package together

291
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
okay so we've got

292
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,279
our toolkit ready to go we can book it

293
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,880
in the diary

294
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
and we are on the way to saving the

295
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,080
enterprise when it's burning to the

296
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
ground and being the hero that saves the

297
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
day

298
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,040
everyone's going to be like yeah

299
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,200
incident response drills exciting stuff

300
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,120
right instead of not knowing one of

301
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,800
these things

302
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
and how do we actually do it

303
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,519
all we're going to do we're going to

304
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
look under the hood right now

305
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
and we're going to do that with two

306
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,680
words

307
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,640
audience participation

308
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,920
all right

309
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,519
so what i need we're going to build out

310
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,079
our blue team so our defensive team so

311
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,519
we're going to start off with three

312
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,760
people on our blue team

313
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,600
so i think what we're going to do maybe

314
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
we'll pick someone so put up your hand

315
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
if you want to volunteer and you have a

316
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,279
little bit of incident response

317
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
experience or maybe a lot

318
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,880
come on guys this isn't going to work

319
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
all right so you got one over here we've

320
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
got one hand up there we've got one up

321
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,240
the back there all right so if you do

322
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
want to come up and i need one more

323
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
but before we get too carried away just

324
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
remember it is covered

325
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,560
so

326
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
i have

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,880
some

328
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,839
markers

329
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,150
[Music]

330
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,319
to make sure that we're nice and safe

331
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,880
all right

332
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,480
i have something for you each

333
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,200
he is prepared

334
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279

and

368
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,079
i have a dice

369
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,199
cool

370
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,480
all right

371
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
we're getting we're getting closer all

372
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,079
right

373
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,560
now i also need somebody to take notes

374
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,279
so

375
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
when we run these exercises we need to

376
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,560
make sure that we're meeting our aims

377
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,639
and objectives and we also need to make

378
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,240
sure that if we identify any missing

379
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,199
steps

380
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,160
or

381
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,800
i know let's say that you go oh i'm

382
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,240
going to get the sysadmins to restore

383
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,839
the backup and you go oh we don't have

384
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,839
backups that's not something to go and

385
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:50,800
fix

386
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,560
so somebody got a pen and paper or a

387
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
laptop that they want to take some notes

388
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,880
on

389
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,160
you won't need to come up here you can

390
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,639
stay where you're sitting

391
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,959
okay we've got a notetaker over there

392
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,600
awesome so we've got our plan and our

393
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,079
playbooks we've assembled the team

394
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,519
we've got the dice we've got our guru

395
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,399
all right now we need an aim or

396
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
and our objectives

397
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,720
all right so our aim today is to test

398
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
ellingson minerals company's new

399
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
nist-based cyber incident response plan

400
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,839
during a cyber incident scenario so

401
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,279
that's the thing we're going to test out

402
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,959
the nis plan

403
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
the objectives is to review the plan

404
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,240
identify any missing steps in the plan

405
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
we're going to get the team to practice

406
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
the plan

407
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
and we're going to develop the team's

408
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,000
decision-making capabilities during an

409
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
incident so this is building out so that

410
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,279
when they're under pressure they can

411
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,240
build out those decisions

412
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
all right so here are the rules

413
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,839
so this is on your front page of your

414
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,199
little kit that you guys have got there

415
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,600
so basically

416
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,839
every time the team take an action we're

417
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,680
going to roll the dice

418
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,519
if it is

419
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,480
11 to 20 that thing worked okay so

420
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,680
you're going to i'm going to escalate in

421
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,920
my box he's going to fix it and you roll

422
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,480
a 5. well bad luck is it the pub you

423
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
gotta sort it out right

424
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,800
you get a plus five if you've got a

425
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,519
documented procedure so you have some

426
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,560
in behind the front page there

427
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
and you also get a plus two if

428
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,560
somebody's trained in that activity okay

429
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,040
now at any point our guru master over

430
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,199
here is going to throw in what's called

431
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,680
an inject so they're going to change

432
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,959
what's happening

433
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,759
and they can come up with random injects

434
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,199
they can use some that black hills has

435
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,560
come up with so

436
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
we've got some examples here but there's

437
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
also some questions in the scenario at

438
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,240
the back of the nist playbook as well

439
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,160
feel free to make up your own as crazy

440
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,560
as you like it doesn't matter

441
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
alrighty so this is basically what the

442
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
guys have got up the front here so we've

443
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,279
got the rules

444
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,680
we've got an incident handling checklist

445
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
and then we've got our scenarios at the

446
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,440
back um

447
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,959
and some other information there as well

448
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,959
around you know the kind of things that

449
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,920
we might like to be doing

450
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
are you ready

451
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
sure

452
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
alright so our scenario today is tuesday

453
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
morning it's not saturday afternoon

454
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,600
tuesday morning and there's a new worm

455
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,199
and it's spreading through removable

456
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,839
media so through usbs things like that

457
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,279
it's copying itself

458
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,279
once it's installed onto open windows

459
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,600
shares it's scanning the network

460
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,360
and when the worm effects are hosted

461
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
installs a denial of service agent

462
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,199
okay

463
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,800
the organization's already got

464
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,120
widespread infections

465
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,480
and there's no signatures available yet

466
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
in the antivirus okay so we're just

467
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,360
coming in we're seeing it around the

468
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,600
network maybe we've had a behavioral

469
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,560
trigger

470
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,440
on

471
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
you know our endpoint detections or

472
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
something like that

473
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,720
but there's no signature

474
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
we're not quite at that point yet there

475
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,519
will be in a few hours so keep that in

476
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,199
mind

477
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,199
so what we do now

478
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,559
is

479
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,079
we've got some extra questions out of

480
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,119
the nist

481
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,919
scenarios that we can use

482
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,079
but basically we throw it over to the

483
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,679
blue team

484
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,400
no pressure but what are you going to do

485
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,630
well lucky this is fictitious right

486
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,520
[Laughter]

487
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,160
what do you guys

488
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,080
all think well it grew what's our

489
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,960
endpoint protection

490
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,200
semantic endpoint all right

491
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,440
so

492
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,840
what you'd normally do is you take this

493
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,840
i'll knock it over if i go that way yeah

494
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,880
give it give it a little yeah so this is

495
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
really going to look at semantic

496
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,480
endpoint

497
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
and we have a 12. so semantics uh the

498
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
console's up you can log in and you can

499
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
actually see what it's saying

500
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,880
so we we can see the size of the problem

501
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,280
is what you're saying

502
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,960
we

503
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,600
rolled a 12 and the semantic endpoint

504
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,000
detected something so i'm assuming it's

505
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
detected our infected hosts or unusual

506
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,600
activity on those right so what's next

507
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,679
what's next don't forget just throw them

508
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,120
in everyone just yell out and i'll

509
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,600
repeat it

510
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
i'll be checking the backups making sure

511
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
they're there and getting them isolated

512
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,799
get backup servers disconnected

513
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,400
this could easily be destroying data it

514
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,559
could be around

515
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
all right so the backup servers are

516
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,840
pegged give it a roll let's see

517
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,280
15. all right so you're looking at the

518
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,880
backup servers you can get to the backup

519
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
service but they're pegged at 99

520
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,370
yeah that is a concern

521
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,200
[Laughter]

522
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
so so i would go with some kind of

523
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,760
containment we we want to try and

524
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
you know uh tell people to turn off

525
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,080
their laptop if they can we're going to

526
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,799
try and contain things old school turn

527
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,320
stuff off don't forget you've got a

528
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
checklist there i've tried to help you

529
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,160
guys out

530
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,039
do i tip it

531
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,679
all right 11. you guys are having good

532
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
luck

533
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,919
all right so they're going to try and

534
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,440
contain the laptop or the laptops

535
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,360
i imagine we're in an organization about

536
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
eight laptops

537
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
so

538
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,720
okay what do you think eight laptops or

539
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
800

540
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,760
yeah 800 i think with semantics

541
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,679
so you were able to contain those eight

542
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,880
laptops and you've got another

543
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,360
792 to go

544
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
there's some quick math for you

545
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,360
this guy's looking at the checklist so

546
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,080
he knows what's going on

547
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,000
okay so the organization's just started

548
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,720
a project that's very time limited

549
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,559
and turning off those eight laptops has

550
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,080
just cost a million dollars in lost

551
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,120
revenue

552
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,559
by the way that's per hour

553
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,600
so that's where you'd go to your hot

554
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,760
your hot site and go over and get them

555
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,960
yeah yeah all right so you're gonna come

556
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
to the hot side

557
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,679
all right

558
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,080
let's see

559
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
it's infected too

560
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
all right do you have a procedure for

561
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,399
cutting to your hot site

562
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,240
it should be

563
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,159
not in that book there's not

564
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,760
so have you got that as a note no

565
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,240
procedure for cut over to hot site

566
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
okay all right but

567
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,919
in the checklist what it's saying we're

568
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,080
at the stage where we're first stage was

569
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
detect an analysis and that's where we

570
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,440
thought our end point protection would

571
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,360
have gotten to now we're looking at the

572
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,400
containment eradication and recovery

573
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
but some stages we're going to have to

574
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,960
speed up because we're losing that

575
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,679
no pressure one

576
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,600
now yeah and it's surprising like even

577
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,799
though we're having a bit of fun here

578
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,640
when you're doing this with your team

579
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
it actually starts putting that pressure

580
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,600
on even though you're joking and

581
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,799
laughing you're like oh what are we

582
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,640
going to do next yeah

583
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,400
so if we can

584
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,559
somehow

585
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,200
isolate the window shares so that way

586
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
they're not going to get any more

587
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,679
protection or infections happening

588
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,679
so update rules

589
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,159
host based rules or host based file i

590
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,520
feel like there goes another million

591
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,639
bucks an hour but let's do it

592
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,960
you guys are lucky 12. yeah all right

593
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,080
all right so the projects met the next

594
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,600
milestone

595
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
and uh they need to start sharing files

596
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,120
with

597
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,120
other teams outside the organization

598
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,960
[Laughter]

599
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,720
hmm that makes it a tough one because

600
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,919
the next thing i wanted to do is cut off

601
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,280
the usb access because we know that's

602
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,120
how this thing spreads okay

603
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,080
but

604
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
we're going to cut off the usb access

605
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
right again

606
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
yep

607
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
seven righty-o

608
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
do you have a process for cutting off

609
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
the usb access i'll be doing a group

610
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,039
policy push it out to all the devices

611
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,960
and just disable it just do whatever so

612
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,080
it sounds like we've got somebody

613
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,280
qualified

614
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,600
which gives you what a plus two

615
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,320
yes so seven plus two is still not good

616
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,559
enough

617
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,919
so you try and push out group policy but

618
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,159
it doesn't work

619
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,640
windows updates

620
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
all right what are we going to do next

621
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,480
what what's happening any

622
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,760
team has shared files with another

623
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
organization the worm has now pivoted to

624
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
that organization and they're unable to

625
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,799
proceed with their work the project is

626
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,240
now losing more revenue and their

627
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,679
customers are very angry that they have

628
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,280
not seen progress on this very important

629
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,640
project all right no pressure dude so

630
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,000
you're going to fix it

631
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,240
so so we've shared the problem because

632
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,720
problem shared is

633
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
and those signatures are coming quicker

634
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
now because more people are infected and

635
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
more people are annoyed which is good

636
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,600
all right so i've got a question is it

637
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
the russian variant that's hit in

638
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,918
brisbane at the moment

639
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,320
yeah so i mean there's probably a

640
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,240
question there right so business is

641
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
obviously trying to get going and do

642
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,679
stuff uh they're probably making the

643
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,880
problem worse

644
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,840
by by trying to power through this thing

645
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,360
so that that's can we

646
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,880
businesses trying to power through them

647
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
making the problem worse that's the

648
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,159
lesson learned out of the exercise so so

649
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,520
can we talk to someone at the right

650
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,760
level to go hey i know your project's

651
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,279
important but if you don't let us do our

652
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,039
job all right there's not going to be a

653
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,760
team left to do this

654
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,960
16. all right

655
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,000
so you've run the rung the the marketing

656
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,279
uh yeah the ceo is like

657
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,640
whatever facebook dude and um

658
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,080
what have they said they said yeah all

659
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,279
right we'll slow down a bit

660
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
the stakeholders said they understand

661
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
the nature of the issue however they had

662
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
not budgeted this project to run over

663
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,159
and they're not sure what's going to

664
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,600
happen if they can't get us completed in

665
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,520
time

666
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,360
very very concerned

667
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
can we check our cyber insurance covers

668
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
this all right we're checking the

669
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
insurance

670
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,840
this is a really important role come on

671
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,320
come on i'm an expert in this by the way

672
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
eight plus two

673
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,960
plus two does ten but it's gotta be

674
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,840
eleven

675
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,600
eleven so the cyber insurance yes sorry

676
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,679
your premium bounce last month you don't

677
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,080
have any coverage

678
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,760
can i take it through to the high court

679
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,080
please

680
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,039
all right um i think you guys get the

681
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,919
idea yeah um so what we might do

682
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,679
uh is

683
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,840
we won't right we might hold it there

684
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,240
i'm just looking at the time

685
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,919
so hopefully that's giving you a bit of

686
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,320
an overview on how you can fairly

687
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,760
quickly and easily set up one of these

688
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,640
things

689
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,400
and you can make it engaging and fun for

690
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
your team

691
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
and to be perfectly honest the hardest

692
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,919
part for me was finding the dice

693
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
now i have run this with a six-sided

694
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,840
dice you just got a half the numbers

695
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
yes i have used that as well an app on

696
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,679
the phone

697
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,520
all right so

698
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,120
just to cover off we're going to go back

699
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
to our note taker so

700
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,320
our aim was to test ellensen mineral

701
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,640
company's new nist-based hybrid response

702
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,360
plan during a cyber incident scenario

703
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,520
so what do you reckon do we get a tick

704
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,240
or is it a uh

705
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,520
yeah so we got some stuff missing but we

706
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,159
did test it so this is about did we test

707
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,840
it not did we pass

708
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,679
but did we test it

709
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,279
so that's an important thing to note

710
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,840
right so the aim of the exercise was to

711
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,360
test the plan

712
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,880
the objectives are more around whether

713
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
we passed or not

714
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,679
so did we review the plan

715
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,640
yeah

716
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,240
i'm not sure

717
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,760
sorry

718
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,320
um did we review the plan

719
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,799
um i'm not sure and i don't think we did

720
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,710
no i didn't see anybody read it or

721
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,960
[Laughter]

722
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
did we identify some missing steps

723
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,360
definitely yeah

724
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,240
um did the team practice executing the

725
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,960
cyber incident response plan

726
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
not directly

727
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,159
yeah i'd give them a tick for that one

728
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,360
they practiced it they might not have

729
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,919
done real good but they practiced

730
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,400
they practiced it

731
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,000
and did we develop the decision making

732
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
i believe so yeah yeah okay so that one

733
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
can have a tick as well and we've also

734
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,679
got a list of lessons learned that we'll

735
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,919
go into our after action report

736
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,640
around backups um

737
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,799
what else do we have

738
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,039
cyber insurance that was it

739
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,399
all right so the idea is then you take

740
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,159
these away and you go and fix them so

741
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,000
that next time they're there ready to go

742
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
you pay your cyber insurance bill you

743
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
make sure this is admins are doing the

744
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,440
backups all that kind of stuff

745
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,480
cool

746
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,399
now if you guys are super keen there's

747
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,279
two qr codes um so i'll leave them up

748
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,720
there for a second if you want to take a

749
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,240
picture or whatever

750
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,360
that will link through to the nist

751
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,360
800-61 r2 and also link through the

752
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,880
black hills infosec cubicles and

753
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
compromises page where you can go and

754
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,279
download it um the black hills guys have

755
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,679
a heap of cool stuff so have a look

756
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,919
around their site um

757
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,799
and

758
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,159
you know see what else they've got that

759
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,840
you can use um they've got some pretty

760
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,480
interesting things

761
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,039
okay well i think that kind of wraps it

762
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,559
all up and brings us to an end of the

763
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
chat um

764
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,720
if there are any questions i am happy

765
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,399
to answer something start with a round

766
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,840
of applause come on

767
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:18,680
[Applause]

768
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,769
[Music]

769
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,120
thank you that's really good uh my

770
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,640
question is where did you get those cups

771
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,399
that meant you had to use barbecue tongs

772
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,320
to help to

773
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,399
and should the contestants go and

774
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,399
sanitize now um

775
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,120
i i think the uh

776
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,799
confidentiality agreement prohibits me

777
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,159
from disclosing

778
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
where i got those from

779
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,679
it might have been the front counter out

780
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,960
there

781
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
yeah

782
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,039
nice so so as a guy that's obviously

783
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,440
done a lot of this full stop

784
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,799
um

785
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,480
what would you say to a team that's just

786
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,039
trying to get started um that's the most

787
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,320
important part is to get started um

788
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,000
and and start going through something

789
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,200
like this like this is really light

790
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,799
touch right like

791
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,000
um

792
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
you know you're probably not going to do

793
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,120
this with your board um

794
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,399
and if you are you're probably going to

795
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,080
put a bit more time into it and you're

796
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,120
going to flesh out some relevant

797
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,799
scenarios and and read that 800-84

798
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,000
um

799
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,279
you know there's other organizations

800
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,360
that can help you out as well so

801
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
acsc is obviously a really good one to

802
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,960
start with um but yeah just get started

803
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,919
right so

804
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:28,799
um

805
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,159
you know we use this for a whole range

806
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,520
of things so

807
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,279
there may be playbooks that you haven't

808
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,760
used for a while or you may see threats

809
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,159
changing in the landscape and you know

810
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,279
all of a sudden there's other companies

811
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,720
in your vertical you know you look at

812
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,000
healthcare right

813
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,480
um that's a good example where

814
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,399
um fishing has probably gone through the

815
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,159
roof so if you're looking at that and

816
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,159
you're saying oh geez all these other

817
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,000
healthcare providers are getting fishing

818
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
through the roof why don't we review our

819
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,440
fishing playbook and you can do it this

820
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,399
way and you just stand it up and go um

821
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,399
it's fairly easy and then you know you

822
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,360
can do it in your team meeting or

823
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,440
whatever but yeah get started is is

824
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,799
probably the

825
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,240
and finding the dice is the hardest

826
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,559
thing so well paul knows where to get

827
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,880
him yeah any other questions

828
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,320
there's one right up the back sorry

829
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,279
sure

830
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,360
templates that you could recommend oh

831
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,679
um i mean really the niss guide is a

832
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,399
template um so if you open it up like

833
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,039
there's i don't know however many pages

834
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,640
and it sets through each stage and the

835
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,399
things that you need to consider

836
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,200
it's not specific to scenarios uh so if

837
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
you have a specific scenario just google

838
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,760
you know incident response plan for

839
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,960
ransomware or um

840
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,320
i don't know denial of service or

841
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,399
whatever it is um and then you need to

842
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,600
take that and just map it into what

843
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
tools your organization has

844
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,360
so you know you might want to turn on

845
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,799
your denial of service protection but if

846
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,159
you don't have any then there's probably

847
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,519
not much point having that in your

848
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,200
playbook

849
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,519
so that kind of thing

850
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,880
but there's

851
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,399
there's a few that i've found like in

852
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,840
github

853
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,000
and that people put together that

854
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,600
are freely available and then you can

855
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,399
take that and tailor them

856
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,919
and use them

857
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,120
to build out your own

858
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,918
any other questions

859
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,720
g'day um

860
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,159
first thing uh

861
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,519
we've actually got a slack bot that does

862
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,919
a d20 roll that you can do

863
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,640
um it's super easy to set up uh which

864
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,000
kind of leads me into the second thing

865
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,360
uh do you have you found any

866
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,120
difficulties with moving to work from

867
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,960
home uh compared to being able to run

868
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,240
this in the office compared to running

869
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
this in the office

870
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,720
um

871
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,200
a little bit um

872
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,200
and it is more practice um so

873
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,799
you know i'm used to being able to see

874
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,880
what everybody's doing um so normally i

875
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,399
have a role that's like an incident

876
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,880
coordinator wrong and i'm used to seeing

877
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,480
what all the guys are doing because they

878
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,120
sit in front of me um

879
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,399
whereas at home you don't get that so um

880
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,399
we've had to transition to

881
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,840
i guess a system where we're talking a

882
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,360
lot more

883
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
over you know video conferencing and

884
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,799
chat channels and things like that so

885
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,000
that we can get that information

886
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
feedback

887
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
we kind of know where everything's at

888
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,039
and who's doing what and how we're

889
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,519
progressing um

890
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,440
so it has changed but it hasn't really

891
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,600
slowed us down it's just

892
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,200
like a little bump i mean yep we got

893
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,919
this now we're doing it this way

894
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,799
and

895
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,399
we're now kind of operating in a hybrid

896
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,559
model between online and

897
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,840
in the office

898
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,720
and

899
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
yeah it's it's still working well

900
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,240
and i think

901
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,399
you know it's really good for

902
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,600
you know when you're having your staff

903
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,120
come on board

904
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,799
they can shadow easier if you're on like

905
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,000
a video conference store you can share

906
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,039
your screen out and they can see what

907
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,880
other people are doing so that they can

908
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,799
get that response

909
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,039
kind of muscle memory built built from

910
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,880
there and that's what's going to happen

911
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,559
in real life at the moment right should

912
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,760
something kick off you don't have the

913
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
luxury of well maybe we do in brisbane i

914
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,279
don't know yeah

915
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,559
but um

916
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,399
yeah you know it's also great because

917
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,760
you know when you get rung on holidays

918
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,080
or whatever um often you're not in the

919
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
office when you're on holidays

920
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,120
[Music]

921
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,399
so you're having to run it remotely

922
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,000
anyway so you need to go places where

923
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,880
there's no phone reception

924
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,159
everyone one last round of applause

925
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,480
thanks very much

926
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,840
foreign
