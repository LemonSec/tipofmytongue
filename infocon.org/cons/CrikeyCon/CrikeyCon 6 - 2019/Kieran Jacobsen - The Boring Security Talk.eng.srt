1
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,760
so our next speaker is Karin Jacobson

2
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,669
and I remember Karin's talk from

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,380
Bacharach econ one actually cuz he was

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:31,770
like he did a PowerShell talk back when

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,850
PowerShell stuff was really still like I

6
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,130
think we've just mentioned it on the

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,200
show recently about how like you know

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,390
then you could just people would add

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,670
script protection so that you could only

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,860
run signed PowerShell scripts and you

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,210
know hope Microsoft set this up in such

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,519
a way that if this was bothering you you

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,470
could just turn off you know script

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,330
checking it was it was it was a horror

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,930
show talk from someone who really are

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:59,440
Kieran was at that point a you know

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,400
Windows Windows guy right so today he's

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,040
doing something called the boring

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,390
security talk and I'm going to read from

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,798
the abstract here he says we all know

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,049
that securing our applications is a

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,180
necessity but it can be incredibly

23
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,250
boring with time and budget constraints

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,380
we often focus on the more exciting

25
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,640
security aspects and tools but in this

26
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,530
talk we'll be looking at some of the

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,899
aspects to our application security that

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,569
are often overlooked the software do we

29
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:25,090
depend on CIC the infrastructure sending

30
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:28,119
email and resolving DNS you know Allah

31
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:31,420
the basics now Karen Jacobsen is the

32
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:35,079
head of IT at ratify and a Microsoft

33
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,520
Microsoft a Microsoft MVP and we're

34
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,270
gonna bring him up there give me the

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,839
studies talk it's Karen Jacobson

36
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,908
[Music]

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,130
good afternoon everybody my name's Karen

38
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,400
Jacobson this is actually my fourth

39
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,979
cracky talk on conference fault I'm

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,190
speaking to you all and it's a pleasure

41
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,158
to return every year and and talk about

42
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,960
various epic things last year last time

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,210
as a cracker con sorry I spoke about dev

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,880
sack ops while that content was built

45
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,889
upon my experiences of DevOps and dev

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,100
sack ops within a team within my own

47
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,679
team today's content is a bit of an

48
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,180
extension of a lot of the stuff that

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,250
I've been working on in that sort of

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,890
respects I want to talk about things

51
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,840
that often get overlooked and a lot of

52
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,149
this stuff came about from acquisition

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,150
processes and things as well things like

54
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,680
protecting a CIC the infrastructure

55
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,920
email security practices or bad

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,209
practices DNS management and an

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,040
understanding what happens when

58
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:38,880
dependencies within your software stack

59
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:40,799
go bad so see ICD systems in a DevOps

60
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,170
world they're the heart of a

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
smooth-running organization they're a

62
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,309
mission critical aspect to our

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,590
infrastructure but as anyone in the room

64
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,720
ever considered the chaos that an

65
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,450
attacker could get up to if they'd owned

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,750
this infrastructure your team city your

67
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,850
octopus your Jenkins I see a lot of

68
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,340
badly set up infrastructure and so let's

69
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,209
take a look at some of those common

70
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,100
issues people love to overshare on the

71
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,320
internet is my usual statement it's

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,350
common to see the startups and smaller

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,590
less mature organizations operating

74
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,358
entirely in the cloud and exposing the

75
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,630
management interfaces and the API

76
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,329
interfaces of their C ICT infrastructure

77
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,040
to the Internet

78
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:28,560
we're not talking about saz offerings

79
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,540
like agile devops or github gitlab here

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,650
we're talking out your team city your

81
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:37,078
octopus your Jenkins there's a lot of

82
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,880
authentication mistakes going on the

83
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,340
lack of hate to dps is probably the

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,489
biggest by far but that's not going to

85
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,709
get you owned as such the use of shared

86
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,280
accounts or generic accounts is very

87
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,560
common this is in most cases a licensing

88
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,140
violation and not just a security issue

89
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,360
you're destroying your audit trails in

90
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,409
the process you're losing the ability of

91
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,569
knowing who's pushed what to production

92
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:07,030
when named accounts are being used stale

93
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:09,280
accounts are really common you know

94
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,049
systems where the developers who had

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
access they've long since left the

96
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:15,129
company they're off somewhere else yet

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,340
this accounts on the CI CD

98
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:21,070
infrastructure are still active there's

99
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,080
endless stories of disgruntled employees

100
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,539
coming back and trashing environments

101
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,990
and a CI CD system would be a great

102
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:31,690
place to do that sort of activity the

103
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,789
lack of MFA is another problem

104
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,260
it's one of the strongest defenses

105
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,599
against credential spraying attacks

106
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,270
we're not really seeing those directed

107
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,919
at CIC the infrastructure but only is a

108
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:47,169
matter of time I'm often contacted by

109
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,039
consultants working in heavily locked

110
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,870
down networks

111
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,060
the devs don't have admin rights in

112
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,789
production some cases and inhabitant dev

113
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,740
or even on their own workstations the

114
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:59,650
security teams are super happy that

115
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,570
they've locked everything down what they

116
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,198
haven't realized though is is a really

117
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,090
big hole in their security model the

118
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,030
devs have admin rights on the CI CD

119
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,030
infrastructure that infrastructure has

120
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,729
admin rights on prod so in essence the

121
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,010
developers do have admin access to

122
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:21,400
production now how does this happen

123
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:25,120
there's a bunch of different ways I see

124
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,830
with AWS cloud the the keys are given

125
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,349
far too much access to too many

126
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:34,359
resources and too many actions that's a

127
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:36,280
big one I'm seeing these days how do I

128
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,010
put this in a family-friendly way I

129
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,989
really don't understand why patching is

130
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,320
so hard anymore

131
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,360
you've got hours patching plans but you

132
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,810
might be running old versions of CI CD

133
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,419
tools and we saw this yesterday with the

134
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,400
talk about ideas of March you know

135
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,198
there's old versions of those tools and

136
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,448
get new compilers and stuff that are out

137
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,669
there and can hurt you for those of you

138
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,320
running Jenkins in your environment how

139
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,150
comfortable are you that all of your

140
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,440
instances are actually up-to-date it

141
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,400
sort of really rough for you with

142
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,719
security patches

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,500
are they all up-to-date so in February

144
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
last year

145
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,759
hackers exploited vulnerabilities in

146
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,130
Jenkins to make over three million

147
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,840
dollars mining Manero they were

148
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,300
successful for the sheer fact that

149
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,000
there's so many Jenkins servers that are

150
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,100
exposed to the Internet and from

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,020
experience these instances have quite a

152
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,699
lot of computing power associated with

153
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,349
them what shocks me with this case is

154
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,289
that no one really noticed that their

155
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,430
bills and deployments were taking longer

156
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,900
maybe they did they just upped the

157
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,199
amount of resources on the instances I

158
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,330
don't know think about your environment

159
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,150
if you're running these cloud instances

160
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,500
would you have noticed this happening or

161
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,359
would it have been the bills shock when

162
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,760
you get your Azure or your AWS bill and

163
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,240
you go why is it $60,000 for the month

164
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,979
would that be have you're monitoring so

165
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,770
how do we start to protect against these

166
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,599
attacks

167
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,008
so network security 101 tells us we

168
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:09,580
should be restricting access where

169
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:12,430
possible do you need to expose your CI

170
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,229
CD systems to the Internet if your

171
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,820
development and production environments

172
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,800
aren't totally within the corporate

173
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,599
network and it's all locked down then

174
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,840
maybe it doesn't need to be accessible

175
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,940
via the internet if it does need to be

176
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,179
can you restrict it down to say a set of

177
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,940
trusted IP addresses you know your your

178
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:34,180
secure server IP addresses your office

179
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,469
IP ease of you know a VPN endpoint if

180
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,110
you can't do that can you at least

181
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,849
restrict what destination ports you can

182
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,970
connect to if it's something like

183
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:45,280
Jenkins you might have HTTP https

184
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,800
management you might have SSH to manage

185
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,599
the server you don't really need FTP or

186
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,010
telnet or anything else open to the

187
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:57,880
Internet authentication and privileged

188
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:59,699
access has to occur over HTTPS it can't

189
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,260
occur over plaintext protocols

190
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,199
certificates are easy to obtain now

191
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,659
there's no excuse and don't be lazy and

192
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,270
used self-signed certificates users

193
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:13,060
should have their own accounts no shared

194
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,180
accounts personal preference is to use

195
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,580
something like SSO I don't care if it's

196
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,120
as your ad or open LDAP or any of those

197
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,599
sorts of things just use a sense

198
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,790
any provider the benefits of s is so

199
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,280
better auditing monitoring and user

200
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,139
account provisioning and de-provisioning

201
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,219
if you see I see these systems are

202
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,610
exposed to the Internet

203
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:37,159
Mike my personal sort of belief is that

204
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,849
MFA is mandatory you don't get a choice

205
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,559
out of that one it has to be enabled

206
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:44,839
quick side comment here if you're making

207
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,910
an application or you're a vendor that's

208
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,150
supplying applications and you don't

209
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,160
support SSO or MFA in 2019 or you're

210
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,650
gonna try and charge me extra for it I

211
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,180
am actively looking at replacing your

212
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,069
products within my environment

213
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,770
I don't want your insecure crap in my

214
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:04,880
environment anymore that's just the way

215
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm running things now you see I see

216
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,939
these systems your service accounts need

217
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,760
to run with the less privileged as

218
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,710
possible avoid local system in route on

219
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,170
Windows and Linux if you're running

220
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,960
within an Active Directory environment

221
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:20,479
don't run as domain admin don't run as

222
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,060
enterprise admin use standard user

223
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,520
accounts where possible restrict your

224
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,189
AWS keys to only the resources and the

225
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,709
actions they need to perform as URIs as

226
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,770
your security should be assigned at a

227
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:36,650
resource or a resource group level not

228
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,630
at a subscription level think about

229
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,390
restricting access to your CI CD

230
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,950
infrastructure that junior dev that only

231
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:47,900
needs to view the status of builds

232
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:50,180
doesn't need admin access build a

233
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,819
patching plan that includes all of the

234
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,160
tools and you develop a chain IDs dev

235
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,130
tools compilers packaging software in

236
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,750
your CI CD components you've already got

237
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,339
OS patching plans you just need to

238
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,260
extend it to the rest of the software

239
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:10,339
stack so one little interesting story

240
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:12,319
about CI CD from 2017 they're actually

241
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:15,500
BOTS that we're going through github and

242
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,900
would hunt for projects that used CI for

243
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,910
pull request validation they would then

244
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,579
replace the code of the project with

245
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:25,490
Bitcoin mining code and of course create

246
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,830
a pull request and then of course your

247
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,230
that code would then be automatically

248
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,120
run as part of the PR validation process

249
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,329
we all love these automated builds the

250
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,110
trigger off and

251
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:39,059
decided they could but mine Bitcoin via

252
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,850
I will pretty quickly shut down via

253
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:44,549
github they put controls in place to

254
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,179
prevent this from happening but once

255
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,249
again

256
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,559
how would you detect this attack in your

257
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:51,239
environment would it be Bill shock again

258
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:58,368
that's your you know monitoring

259
00:10:51,239 --> 00:11:01,019
mechanism for these styles of attack DNS

260
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:04,040
it's a critical system that never gets

261
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:07,739
the attention it deserves every

262
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,089
organization relies on DNS yet we really

263
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:14,129
don't think about it as much as we do

264
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:16,470
say printing or email and that's a big

265
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:18,689
downfall to most organizations as we've

266
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,369
seen in the last few months and so what

267
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:24,679
are some of the challenges that I see

268
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:24,679
with organizations managing their DNS

269
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,929
organizations really struggle

270
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,170
understanding what DNS entries they have

271
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:37,949
why they're there when were they created

272
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,839
it when were they modified was that

273
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:42,859
entry added by an attacker or a

274
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,970
legitimate administrator with approval

275
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,709
now if you're sitting here and you're

276
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,079
working in an environment with say

277
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:51,419
change management like ITIL you might be

278
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,069
feeling a little smug right now you're

279
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,259
probably thinking well I've got change

280
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:56,819
forms we've got requests proces we know

281
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:00,360
everything that's happening in our

282
00:11:56,819 --> 00:12:02,488
environment to challenges for you when

283
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,899
you go back to work does your change

284
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:09,239
request process actually fully describe

285
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:11,249
what the change is and why and secondly

286
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:14,489
if I was to get your DNS zone and

287
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:16,589
randomly point at one entry could you

288
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:19,410
tell me who created it why they created

289
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:21,119
it and when they created it with that

290
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,559
process take five minutes

291
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,660
we're take an hour a day a week a month

292
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,730
during a security incident time will

293
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,790
matter in how you can answer these

294
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,499
questions particularly around DNS if you

295
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,569
think that an attacker has created that

296
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:37,799
entry and you're about to delete it how

297
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,599
do you know that it's not your

298
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,040
legitimate production service that

299
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,249
you're about to delete the DNS entries

300
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,248
for

301
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,800
the next challenge is around the speed

302
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,219
at which we now need to make DNS changes

303
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,709
in the past I probably happened once

304
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,230
maybe twice a year by a system engineer

305
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:00,000
or a network engineer as part of some

306
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,640
sort of application upgrade cycle

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,690
records were pretty static for years at

308
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,180
a time things are changing now we want

309
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,390
faster application release cycles we

310
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,219
want daily releases we want DevOps yet a

311
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,230
lot of organizations really haven't

312
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,450
changed their approach to managing DNS

313
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,020
we've still got ops teams going into a

314
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,730
console and making the changes manually

315
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,459
and this leads to a bunch of different

316
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,589
problems and the obvious thing is that

317
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:34,380
there's a bottleneck it's going to take

318
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:36,779
more time to make those changes if I had

319
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,750
a dollar every outage that was caused by

320
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:43,160
DNS I'd probably be driving an expensive

321
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:46,680
sports car and have my own private jet

322
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,410
why do these challenges occur well it's

323
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,099
often just a simple issue of visibility

324
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:55,860
those impacted by a DNS change are often

325
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,370
the last to know it's happening or they

326
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,910
often find out after the fact this is

327
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,410
another point where change management

328
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:08,250
really should have helped us with this

329
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:10,170
visibility problem but in my experience

330
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,570
DNS changes tend to get hidden in the

331
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,099
process they're low priority changes

332
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,410
they're low visibility changes are low

333
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,790
risk and so people aren't aware that

334
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,279
we're about to change the IP addresses

335
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,589
of you know are the DNS entries of the

336
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:27,420
mail servers you know that everything in

337
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:29,700
our environment needs to connect to with

338
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,120
the move to providers like CloudFlare or

339
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,160
Asia or route 53 by AWS more

340
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,940
organizations are actually outsourcing

341
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,740
the hosting of their external DNS this

342
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,410
is actually improved availability and

343
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,140
DNS services but it introduces some

344
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,300
other sources of problems the main

345
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,110
mechanism for managing these platforms

346
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,060
is typically some sort of web interface

347
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,000
there's often api's and other management

348
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,430
services but left to there

349
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,089
devices a lot of organizations will just

350
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,800
drift to that web experience the biggest

351
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,600
issue with these interfaces is

352
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,069
transposition errors

353
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,990
you've got your change request or the

354
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:12,029
email requesting to make a change you

355
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,490
copy and paste you miss it miss a

356
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:18,269
character instead of web mail it's web

357
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:20,009
mail or something and all of a sudden no

358
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,439
one can get to the service you know or

359
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,180
we manually type an IP address in and we

360
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:28,019
type an eight instead of a nine and all

361
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,849
of a sudden prod goes down all these

362
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,279
interfaces are different they use

363
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,350
different terminology and that is

364
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:37,110
another contributing factor to to

365
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,240
configuration issues things like do we

366
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,819
use user blank to refer to the root of

367
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,430
the DNS zone or an @ symbol or an

368
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:47,790
underscore what what terminology do we

369
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:50,219
use a big part of is that we need a

370
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:55,980
standard method for working with DNS

371
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:57,959
across multiple providers and attacks

372
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,790
against DNS are becoming more and more

373
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,888
popular especially in the last few

374
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,319
months in January there were reports

375
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:07,019
from of multiple US government domains

376
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:10,819
being hit by DNS hijacking things went

377
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:13,290
as far as for DHS and GCHQ to release

378
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:14,969
directives warning about these risks and

379
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,050
telling people what steps or what

380
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,639
actions they needed to take this is rare

381
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,878
for these sorts of organizations to

382
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,939
release these sorts of directives this

383
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,980
is the first for DHS the second for GCHQ

384
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:32,099
the only other one being one a cry for

385
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,550
them dangling DNS entries are another

386
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,910
major problem particularly when cloud

387
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:41,399
infrastructures being used situations

388
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,469
where DNS records particularly see names

389
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,240
they're created they point to some sort

390
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:50,220
of cloud service days weeks months go by

391
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,899
those cloud services are deleted but

392
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,100
those are regional cname records remain

393
00:16:53,899 --> 00:17:00,180
Microsoft actually got hit by this in

394
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,879
2017 ResNet Microsoft comm was a cname

395
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,970
to ResNet - prod as your website's

396
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,220
dotnet couple of months later so many

397
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,010
deleted that as a website but those

398
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,020
entries remained

399
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,359
a security researcher discovered it

400
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,670
alerted them they fix the problem but

401
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,399
all it would have taken was one attacker

402
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,190
creating an azure app service plan as

403
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,579
your app service sorry with the name

404
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,890
resonant portal - prod and they would

405
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,830
have been able to hijack a Microsoft

406
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:33,740
subdomain think about the effectiveness

407
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,679
of a phishing campaign that was actually

408
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,350
a Microsoft subdomain that would

409
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,740
probably be like about a 90% success

410
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:45,919
rate

411
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:49,400
95% maybe so what tools can we start to

412
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:54,440
use to streamline DNS management and

413
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:56,600
reduce these errors so DNS control is an

414
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,580
open source tool written in go and

415
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,830
maintained by the Stack Overflow team

416
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,360
and it allows you to preview changes

417
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:07,220
before pushing them to your DNS provider

418
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,620
ratify we've been using DNS control for

419
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,300
about a year now

420
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,760
anyone at ratify can propose a DNS

421
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,950
change and one of our platforms team can

422
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,240
then go and review it approve it merge

423
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,900
it to master and it's a push to

424
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,790
production this empowers developers to

425
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,980
create changes they can then go and

426
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:28,159
clean up records is they decommission

427
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:32,050
infrastructure and we've removed my team

428
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:37,340
as a bottleneck so how does it help

429
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:41,510
sorry how does it help us solve some of

430
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,760
these challenges so it uses JavaScript

431
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,640
to define a simple format that can be

432
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,129
understood by everybody we can all

433
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,140
propose and review and understand

434
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,930
changes you don't need to be a Java

435
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,510
expert JavaScript expert I have no idea

436
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,460
about what Java Script is or does an ops

437
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:02,930
background yet I've had no problems

438
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:06,350
writing zones the screenshot here is a

439
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:08,810
piece from a public zone that I maintain

440
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,280
for planet PowerShell you can see how

441
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:14,840
easy it is to understand what's an a

442
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:17,149
record a text record a cname with the

443
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,459
human readable format you should also be

444
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,530
able to add comments that describe the

445
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,240
contents of the zone this is production

446
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,020
this is development this is a staging

447
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,150
slot

448
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,800
these are our mail servers so now you

449
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,990
can start to actually answer those

450
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,659
questions of what's that record actually

451
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:37,130
for get version control systems there

452
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,460
another core piece of this DNS

453
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,770
management puzzle we store our DNS

454
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,570
control files in git it gives us a

455
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,360
history of all the changes in our zone

456
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,610
and who made those changes git branches

457
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,439
they're easy to create and merge and

458
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,030
they allow developers and engineers to

459
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,670
make changes and push them into

460
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:58,160
production easily get becomes your

461
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,470
change tracking tool get logged get

462
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,210
blame you use those to work out what

463
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:07,130
changes has been made that broke pride

464
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:09,170
and who made that change platforms like

465
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,929
github and Azure DevOps

466
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:15,920
they extend our get experience with pull

467
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:18,260
requests these are like they like change

468
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,179
requests in ITIL but they're faster to

469
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,340
create they're easier to read and

470
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,679
understand and you don't need a meeting

471
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,230
to get them approved they shine a light

472
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,620
on changes in a way that ITIL promised

473
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,450
us and has never delivered you can

474
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,729
include the teams and the individuals

475
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,490
that might be impacted for approval if

476
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,080
you know that your change for the MX

477
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,540
records is going to impact your mail

478
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,669
servers then maybe you include the email

479
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,440
to you know support teams the security

480
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,929
teams and the desktop you know mobile

481
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,250
support teams as well they can all read

482
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:52,720
the change and then approve it

483
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:55,460
acknowledge they know what's going on

484
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,040
see a CD is the final piece to this

485
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:02,350
puzzle and it removes the risks of human

486
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,940
generated errors we can run DNS controls

487
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,309
preview function for all of our pull

488
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,080
requests and that way we can validate

489
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,240
the changes and report on what actions

490
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,580
it's going to make when we push to prod

491
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,000
this gives us more confidence in the

492
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,129
changes being made once a PR is approved

493
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,870
the changes emerge to production and our

494
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,090
CD process will use the push

495
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,389
functionality to push those changes into

496
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,790
our DNS platforms so as you can see here

497
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,080
we've changed our DNS management flow

498
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,940
from something that requires a lot of

499
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,030
human interaction to something that's

500
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,550
fully automated we've sped up DNS

501
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:42,470
changes from you know minutes to

502
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:44,720
from days two minutes so before I finish

503
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,520
one little example that's actually in

504
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,970
the wild and you can play along at that

505
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,460
link down the bottom here we can see a

506
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,370
page on Dells website and it's talking

507
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,050
about their hardware based encryption

508
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,780
the page has links to white papers and

509
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:03,710
case studies training encourages to buy

510
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,820
their product so let's assume that I'm

511
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,400
interested in the trusted computing

512
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,260
guide I'm gonna click the you know hover

513
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,100
over the little link in the bottom at

514
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:15,440
bottom left corner and see where it goes

515
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,320
so goes to a website called Dell for SLG

516
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,690
com I worked out that that used to stand

517
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,520
for Dell for state and local government

518
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,340
it was a website targeted to those

519
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,310
groups and quite a lot of content around

520
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:32,090
security stuff in the past what happens

521
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:34,159
if I click on that link and that's not

522
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:38,570
the Dell website that's a plumbing

523
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,950
supply store in Turkey it seems that

524
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,250
somebody noticed the domain wasn't

525
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,960
renewed and decided to renew the domain

526
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,480
or buy the domain and set up a fun

527
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,410
little traffic redirector so anything on

528
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,650
the Dell website that actually

529
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:54,770
references Dell for SLG com now goes to

530
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,200
the Turkish plumbing supply store your

531
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,960
domains are part of your organization's

532
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,730
brands you need to take the same steps

533
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,860
as you would protecting your logo or

534
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,510
your you know type set and your

535
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,360
background colors on your website that

536
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:14,780
you know to your email domains into your

537
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:16,659
DNS domains as an industry we'd love to

538
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,129
think that we're getting rid of email

539
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,420
the truth is that even if you're using

540
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,570
slack for all your internal

541
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,370
communications email is what you're

542
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,980
using to communicate to your customers

543
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,110
your vendors and your suppliers we use

544
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,490
email activities for things like account

545
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:36,020
creations confirmations password resets

546
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,390
considering how important our email is

547
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,129
to our business it really doesn't appear

548
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,350
that many organizations have taken the

549
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,990
steps to ensure that our recipients of

550
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:50,330
those emails can verify them as being

551
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:51,799
legitimate where do I start with what's

552
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,689
wrong with email least

553
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:56,460
email basted attacks like spam and

554
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,120
phishing and everything else are on the

555
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,039
increase there's more stories of

556
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,139
successful whaling style attacks against

557
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:06,870
executives and high profile targets

558
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:09,120
within organizations I'll come as some

559
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:11,639
sort of formal you know legal subpoena

560
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,639
or customer complaint and they're really

561
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:16,678
really good at hooking you know your

562
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:20,340
executives your CEOs and things like

563
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,269
that they're really good at preying on

564
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,389
those targets

565
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,789
I think by now we've all heard about

566
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:28,590
some of the various executive

567
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:31,490
impersonation attacks these aware say

568
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:34,408
this attack as opposed as like the CEO

569
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,090
they sent an email to say the admin or

570
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:38,279
finance teams or their personal

571
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,260
assistant saying hey I've got this

572
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:42,330
urgent request to transfer money into

573
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,340
this person or this country to complete

574
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,769
it you know our business takeover or

575
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,230
some sort of business transaction or hey

576
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:51,590
I need to buy iTunes gift cards to

577
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:54,059
reward customers for their you know

578
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,309
business to us

579
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,379
these attacks create a sense of urgency

580
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:00,389
and they're coming from people that we

581
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,320
rarely question and that's why they're

582
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:07,019
so successful my frustration with all

583
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,210
this is that we can actually make these

584
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:11,880
attacks harder we can't prevent them but

585
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,279
we can make them more difficult but most

586
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,659
organizations don't seem to care about

587
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:20,580
doing this they don't seem to want to

588
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:22,080
put those controls in place so here's an

589
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,850
email it's been sent from have I been

590
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,908
pwned we're probably all nervous about

591
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,889
about when we get these emails every

592
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:29,789
message is made up of two parts we've

593
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:31,500
got our headers

594
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:33,419
they're basically key value pairs

595
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,519
providing delivery and diagnostic

596
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,590
information and then we've got the

597
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:42,240
message body that's the bit of the email

598
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:44,189
we actually want to read so there's two

599
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,340
headers that cause a lot of confusion

600
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,409
and they're all to do with the from who

601
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,449
the message is from and the problem is

602
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:53,970
that when we send a message using SMTP

603
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:57,360
we actually specify who the message is

604
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:00,090
from twice in the communication when the

605
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,428
SMTP connection is built the sending

606
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:05,070
SMTP client specifies the sender's email

607
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:09,240
address we often call this the end

608
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:11,760
from or SMTP from later on in the mail

609
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,560
headers the client will also specify the

610
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,430
sender again and this is often called

611
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,470
the message header or the from field so

612
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:23,730
the message from or the header from

613
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:27,300
field it's this one that mail clients

614
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:30,300
display to the user when they open that

615
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,580
email these to fit these two headers

616
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,870
don't actually need to match platforms

617
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,030
like this and grid will often use

618
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,149
different entries to track bounce rates

619
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,790
and do redirects and things like that

620
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:43,410
they usually do but they don't have to

621
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:46,040
the return path header here and the

622
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:48,810
headers is created when the server

623
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,700
accepts that email message and that's

624
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,800
actually the envelope from so that's

625
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:58,140
that an initial from address that it it

626
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:00,330
saves so now some basics we can start to

627
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,640
take control of our email environment

628
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,480
and the first step is to work out who is

629
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,890
sending email as your brand

630
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,480
you've got your obvious choices your

631
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,820
corporate email your internal

632
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,040
applications but there's probably a lot

633
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,950
of other sources that you might want to

634
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:19,470
consider shadow IT that your IT teams

635
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,880
probably don't know about your marketing

636
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,100
and sales teams are probably using

637
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,820
services like MailChimp and SendGrid to

638
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:30,500
send emails to customers

639
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:33,659
another big hurdle is says products a

640
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,060
number of these programs platforms want

641
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:39,420
to send email as your domain and it's

642
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:42,419
typically the HR ones say an employee

643
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,310
creates a leave request the HR system

644
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,500
will then want to send an email as that

645
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:48,690
employee to their manager saying hey can

646
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,520
you approve this and they're the ones

647
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,860
that often get overlooked when we start

648
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:57,420
to sort of work out what sending email

649
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:59,100
is our brand in some organizations the

650
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:03,300
thought of determining all the sources

651
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,820
is too much as I said most organizations

652
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,220
have policies around using their brand

653
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,100
what colors can be used how the logo can

654
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,190
be used you should be protecting it like

655
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,709
any other asset if you don't take steps

656
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,630
to protect it how do I actually you know

657
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,270
how can I actually believe that you take

658
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,940
security you know strongly how do you

659
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,980
actually believe a bank when they say

660
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,100
they they take our customer privacy

661
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,870
seriously so once we know who is sending

662
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,840
email we can start looking at setting up

663
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:36,299
SPF and it's an IP list of those who can

664
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,970
send email is our domain it's maintained

665
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:42,289
in DNS receivers can look at that list

666
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:44,340
and then reject unauthorized messages a

667
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:46,590
common misconception

668
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,539
with SPF is that it validates the

669
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,990
message from header it's actually the

670
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:55,169
envelope from SPF has some advantages

671
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,539
and disadvantages we can actually tack

672
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:59,520
different records together so we don't

673
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:01,890
need to know all of the IP addresses for

674
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,918
office 365 or Google Apps we just

675
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:07,679
reference to those providers the

676
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:10,740
limitation here is you only get ten DNS

677
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,020
queries some platforms check and hit

678
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,960
stop at ten others don't so we need to

679
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:19,710
take a bit of care once you've got your

680
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,409
SPF records we can move on a D Kim D Kim

681
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,210
uses digital signatures it's not quite

682
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:27,630
the same level of his protection as say

683
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,669
PGP or s/mime these signatures are not

684
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,400
visible to the recipient they're added

685
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:34,320
to the headers by the sending server and

686
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,400
then they're validated by the receiving

687
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,500
server we put the public keys of the

688
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,770
sending servers into DNS and that's how

689
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,650
we do that that verification deacon

690
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:48,179
validates the message from header so

691
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,280
it's submit it's actually handling the

692
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:53,190
other from header that we're talking

693
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,230
about before it's going to take a lot

694
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:57,030
more work to set it up it's a lot more

695
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,679
difficult than SPF because you need to

696
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,750
make sure that every system that's

697
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,510
sending email as your organization

698
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,490
supports signing those messages I had to

699
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,710
wait six months for one size van and to

700
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,360
get their act into gear and it was only

701
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,700
on threatening that we're gonna leave

702
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,209
them that they actually finally deployed

703
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:18,360
it once you've got D Kim then we can

704
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,580
start looking at D mark a lot of

705
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,530
organizations are terrified that D mark

706
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,178
policies going to result in their emails

707
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,250
not being delivered to customers and

708
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,230
you're right you can shoot yourself in

709
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,290
the foot with D mark but if you take

710
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,000
care you can ensure successful delivery

711
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,658
d mark builds up

712
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,929
builds upon SPF and dekum provides more

713
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:42,450
validation that the message from and the

714
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:44,850
envelope from headers are aligned and

715
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,250
the idea is that if a message passes

716
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:51,480
both these checks and the headers are

717
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:54,030
aligned it's a valid message domains can

718
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,860
specify different policies these are

719
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,710
actions that the receivers should take

720
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,719
when a message fails validation senders

721
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,640
can also specify if receivers need to

722
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,820
provide delivery reports on what they've

723
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,860
accepted and what they've rejected your

724
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,710
Demark policy is stored once again in

725
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,539
DNS now you know why DNS is so important

726
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,220
to this story

727
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:16,260
start with the policy of none moved to

728
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,380
quarantine policy and then finally onto

729
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:22,530
a rejection policy quick note about

730
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,510
office 365 is it actually handles the

731
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,450
reject policy as it would the quarantine

732
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:30,690
policy so those emails will still be

733
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:33,990
delivered to the junk mail folder of a

734
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:36,990
recipient even if the sender main said

735
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:39,600
hey no you should reject anything that

736
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,220
doesn't succeed validation I don't know

737
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,990
why they've done this they've just done

738
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:49,490
it that way let's just talk about an

739
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:52,409
oxymoron that is Bank grade security

740
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:54,929
phishing scorecard tracks SPF D command

741
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:58,080
D mark configuration of organizations

742
00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,539
worldwide 53% of banks and financial

743
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,230
service providers here in Australia have

744
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:07,020
no D mark configuration at all

745
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:10,370
38% have a policy of none and just 9%

746
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:13,379
have a policy of reject or quarantine

747
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:16,949
pretty well I'm gonna say something else

748
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,539
but it's pretty bad how much do they

749
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,940
really care about the privacy and

750
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,150
security of their customers they really

751
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,150
don't

752
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:29,520
so almost all software projects depend

753
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,049
on other software and this could be

754
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,600
JavaScript packages

755
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:36,059
docker images libraries provided by

756
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,158
vendors the problem is that we provide

757
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:41,190
considerable trust in these third

758
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,419
parties that write these dependencies we

759
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,940
often think that they're better people

760
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,919
and us a bit of impostor syndrome really

761
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,359
we like to believe that there

762
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,129
going introduced malicious code

763
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:52,789
deliberately and that they follow

764
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:55,080
similar security practices to our own

765
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:57,779
unfortunately over the last year or so

766
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:02,699
that trust has been broken quite a large

767
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:04,440
number of times February last year the

768
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,619
JavaScript plug-in browsealoud was

769
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,379
compromised and it was it's code was

770
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:13,139
altered to inject coin hives Mineiro

771
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:15,709
minor for several hours anyone visiting

772
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:18,299
the over 4,000 impacted websites

773
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,730
inadvertently ran the hidden mining code

774
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:22,769
on their computer australian web sites

775
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,169
included government departments city

776
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:28,200
councils charities disability support

777
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:30,299
provider's quite a few that actually

778
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,299
have access to the metadata retention

779
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:35,580
scheme also run browsealoud which scares

780
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:38,369
the hell out of me

781
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,799
s RI or sub resource integrity is the

782
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:44,090
best defense here it basically allows a

783
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,259
website to tell users tell users browser

784
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,570
to check the integrity of these

785
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:50,850
third-party assets if the integrity

786
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:55,379
doesn't match the stored hash it doesn't

787
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:57,570
load them in June last year it was

788
00:33:55,379 --> 00:34:00,029
reported that 17 malicious containers

789
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:02,009
were removed from docker hub some of

790
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:04,320
these images were just harmless and

791
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:06,720
mining Manero others created reversed

792
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,899
shells or attempted to install backdoors

793
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,179
on the host machine they were available

794
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:15,418
for over a year before docker pulled

795
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:18,299
them estimates are that the attackers

796
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:21,839
made around $90,000 mining Manero from

797
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:23,369
the the more harmless ones as we as

798
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,190
we're spoken about yesterday with

799
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:28,440
Sarah's talk the best protection is a

800
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,270
private image repositories where you've

801
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:35,190
validated the security of those docker

802
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:38,549
images in July an attacker compromised

803
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:41,819
the es lint scope and NS lint config

804
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:43,949
eslint NPM packages they published a

805
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:46,799
malicious version that would send the

806
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:49,259
contents of the user's NPM RC to the

807
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:52,829
attacker this file typically contains

808
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,149
your credentials to NPM the belief is

809
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:58,410
that they were trying to get more access

810
00:34:54,149 --> 00:35:00,180
to even more npn maintainer x'

811
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,029
these two packages see three million

812
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:05,460
downloads a week they have 31 directly

813
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:09,600
dependent packages and to 20,000

814
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,080
indirectly dependent packages how did it

815
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,970
happen

816
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,950
the official story is that the

817
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:18,779
maintainer reused passwords and didn't

818
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:21,390
use 2fa as I said earlier not all

819
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:26,880
maintainer x' follow the same security

820
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:29,339
practices as we do just last week

821
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:34,800
attackers added a backdoor to the

822
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:36,480
bootstraps as S SaaS rubygem the great

823
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,460
news about this one was that it was

824
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,800
picked up really quickly somebody in the

825
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,780
community went hey this codes doing some

826
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,240
interesting things and created a github

827
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,640
issue the developers got onto it and

828
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,799
pulled it pretty quickly and it only

829
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,000
took a few hours from initial discovery

830
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,260
initial posting to actually being pulled

831
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,460
unfortunately it was still downloaded

832
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,990
about 12,000 times in those few hours we

833
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,150
don't have a full breakdown of what

834
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,580
happened there's only two developers

835
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:08,600
that actually have push rights to that

836
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,710
repo to that that particular ruby gem

837
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,660
we'll find out more in the next few

838
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,660
weeks about how this incident happened

839
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:22,370
and last week another one last week was

840
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:25,020
a wordpress developer called pip Digg

841
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,680
was accused of adding a number of

842
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,500
suspicious

843
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,330
well malicious features to their

844
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,920
WordPress plugin

845
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,529
and it's a very popular WordPress

846
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,180
plug-in and that included a remote kill

847
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,570
switch that deleted all of your

848
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,690
WordPress tables just drop them all a

849
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,700
remote password change function and it

850
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:50,670
was ddossing a competitor's website as

851
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:53,040
well really nice people it appears that

852
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,500
they even took active measures measures

853
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,509
when they were detected of covering

854
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,690
their tracks they deleted their

855
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:02,190
open-source repos deleted most the

856
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:06,300
history and then reposted them up

857
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:10,590
without any of the malicious code as I

858
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,350
said it's it's a mistake to trust all of

859
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,240
these author

860
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:16,569
is that they're not going to be

861
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,839
deliberately malicious sometimes authors

862
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:25,330
do turn out to be deliberately malicious

863
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:26,680
and pretty much bastards that's it for

864
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,450
me I want to thank you all for listening

865
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,310
to me today I hope that you found

866
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,980
something useful in today's session it

867
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:35,259
wasn't too boring for you I'll be

868
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,760
posting up all the contents of this

869
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,640
presentation on my blog over the next

870
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:48,750
few days thank you all very much for

871
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:51,370
listening to me today well all right

872
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:55,090
good stuff I've been following that that

873
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:57,640
WordPress stuff a little and it's yeah

874
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,690
it's there's been some real but there's

875
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,580
been some other ones as well like

876
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:04,180
WordPress WordPress the world of

877
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,670
WordPress is like that trash fire is

878
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,020
burning brighter than usual yes at the

879
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,870
moment hey our just a quick announcement

880
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:14,440
to there's a whole bunch of prepaid

881
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:16,480
merch at the merge desk that people

882
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,990
haven't picked up so if you have prepaid

883
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,360
for your merch go get it go get it and

884
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:25,240
then merch people can relax and smile

885
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:32,100
all of that um so who's got questions

886
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:32,100
for Karen we got one down there

887
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,620
the question is like how big an

888
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,060
organization do you need to be to do all

889
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,529
of this stuff like because there seems

890
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,529
to be a bit of overhead involved

891
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,740
we have 250 sorry 350 employees right

892
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,220
now I felt it was valuable enough to do

893
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,859
it for that I've done most of these

894
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:04,319
steps for my home domains my project

895
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,540
domains a lot of it certain forget yeah

896
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,830
with on the email stuff yeah email stuff

897
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,200
is pretty much set and forget unless

898
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:12,690
you're adding a new DNS you know a new

899
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:16,259
email sort of sending service and that

900
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:19,050
helps with the shadow IT DNS is pretty

901
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,290
much configure and forget because you

902
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:24,270
know it just runs itself with the CI CD

903
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:26,610
one thing I want to pick up on those you

904
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,740
like I don't trust the authors right and

905
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,510
that goes for things like you know

906
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,189
Dockers docker containers and you know

907
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,210
WordPress plugins and whatever but

908
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,770
that's the world we're in now right

909
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,210
where you don't do stuff yourself

910
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,590
anymore you just take all of this stuff

911
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,870
that other people have done you glue it

912
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:42,210
together and you hope for the best so

913
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,589
you know I just wonder if we're in if

914
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,450
we're in that sort of trap right now

915
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,960
where the advice is to do it all

916
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,819
yourself

917
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,360
but like no one's got time to do that

918
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:54,630
 so we just have to kind of cross

919
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,400
our feet I'd like to think of it as we

920
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,860
just need to every time we bring a new

921
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,770
piece of software a bit from one of the

922
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,150
big vendors or a small guy that sort of

923
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,550
you know go let's coding in their

924
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,710
bedroom for an open-source project we

925
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,570
need to just build that trust and go

926
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:12,360
through those steps if it's open source

927
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:14,070
and it's a small codebase take a look at

928
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,730
it see if there's anything that jumps

929
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,930
out at you no one's got time for that

930
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,000
yeah and there's also the problem to

931
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,529
where that single lone coder in their

932
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,690
bedroom you know might be offered like

933
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:27,120
one Bitcoin or well actually no that's a

934
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,920
bit high less than one Bitcoin to sell

935
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,359
off their project yeah to someone who

936
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,560
says they're gonna you know do something

937
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,600
commercial with it then of course they

938
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,549
just you know loaded up with malicious

939
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,529
 and we've seen cases where that's

940
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,180
happened that if you um come to you know

941
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,460
chrome plug-in vendors and gone here's

942
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,410
$30,000 for your chrome plug-in and yeah

943
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,240
if somebody did that for some of my

944
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,710
software projects and I'd be handing it

945
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:51,419
over yeah yeah good

946
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:53,640
don't use myself projects so if you're a

947
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,980
Russian gangster who wants to buy some

948
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,779
software projects and and and you know

949
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,660
target all users contact here and I

950
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:01,950
think many people use my software so

951
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,609
you're pretty safe there I've got a

952
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,609
question back here

953
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,630
very

954
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:18,049
yeah so what do you say to what do you

955
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,699
say to the rest of the organization when

956
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:21,349
they're accusing you of being a

957
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:22,819
roadblock because you might want to look

958
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:25,749
at the haurache oh they're trying

959
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:28,369
to put everywhere in your organization a

960
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:31,640
lot of time these days I now just refer

961
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:33,349
to things cases or I sort of say hey

962
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,999
remember that time that you were

963
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:36,380
involved in that security breach or you

964
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:37,549
work with that customer and you had to

965
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,349
work through that security breach

966
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:42,979
because of one of the other developers

967
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:45,339
within the customer and they start to

968
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:47,538
realize that hey we need to do this work

969
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:49,159
it seems a good way to convince people

970
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:50,989
isn't it together well here's a printout

971
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:53,119
of some headlines for you clunk you know

972
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:54,769
take a bunch yeah and the other thing is

973
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,039
if you can reduce your roadblocks in

974
00:41:54,769 --> 00:42:00,140
other places within your IT organization

975
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,630
that can be a lot easier and that's why

976
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,578
things like DNS control for us it means

977
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,259
that we've got more spare time to do the

978
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:07,969
security reviews and things like that

979
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:10,459
because we're not trying to manage DNS

980
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:13,989
and all the other sort of stuff that we

981
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:13,989
normally would on a day to day basis

982
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:20,830
anyone else going once going yeah are we

983
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:23,888
going there

984
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,889
[Music]

985
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,990
and see what that is

986
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,990
[Music]

987
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,990
yeah

988
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,379
[Music]

989
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,410
so yeah I had to go how to do

990
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,060
if someone who did it themselves that's

991
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,590
no that's like Lionel's one of the

992
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,690
developers at ratify so he's actually

993
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:57,570
