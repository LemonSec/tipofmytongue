00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,860
applause make some noise and if you

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,239

people doing a good job the organizers

13
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,720
and volunteers I think deserve a big

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,700
round of applause as well so let's make

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,350
a lot of noise for them they still

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,869
picking it those guys in the CTF

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,750
wondering what's going on that was like

18
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:10,520
an average maybe and how about you guys

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,939
you guys have to be the most attractive

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,110
audience I've ever seen this morning so

21
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:21,320
a round of applause beer sales come on

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:23,570

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,600
well there's gonna be some audience

24
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,070
participation this morning I'm sorry

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,030
and that was just to kind of get you

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,460
warmed up a little bit so it all started

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,430
off I know Wednesday night with a long

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,070
drive the white line stretched out in

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,530
front of me and I have got some podcasts

30
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,139
on the playlist and I picked one

31
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,450
particularly that was about impostor

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,600
syndrome and the reason I've done this

33
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,880
I'd noticed on InfoSec Twitter that

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,259
impostor syndrome had come up a few

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,560
times I don't really know what it meant

36
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,960
I was like okay interesting let's find

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,470
out a little bit more and by the time I

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,619
got home from my long drive I kind of

39
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,789
figure out two things one was I knew

40
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:10,970
where I was going to submit for crack

41
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:15,290
econ and the second one was that I'd

42
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:18,230
experienced imposter syndrome so a

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:22,700
disclaimer first of all by no means I'm

44
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,079
a health expert at all just on some

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,069
research I found that's interesting and

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,880
that's what I'm sharing with you guys

47
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,119
today

48
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,660
so before you go out and act on anything

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,450
I say do your diligence and your own

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,859
research and if you need make sure you

51
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:41,420
contact a proper professional so it

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,190
would be pretty cool if impostor

53
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,459
syndrome was like some next-level red

54
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,550
team thing right where you can just beat

55
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,680
anyone you know you'd you'd have all the

56
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,140
pentest firms lining up the hospital hey

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,290
you got any of those imposters we need

58
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,470
to do some red team but it's not quite

59
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,530
like that it'd be pretty cool too many

60
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,240
clicks so according to clients and I'm

61
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,400
so there two ladies that did some

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:13,970
research way back in 1978 it's the

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,150
inability to experience or accept

64
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:21,950
success internally regardless of

65
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:26,510
external evidence so regardless of the

66
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:29,390
external evidence you don't accept that

67
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,540
success so what kind of happens is you

68
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,980
end up creating like this false self so

69
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,870
there's two of you happening inside and

70
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,310
the false self is the person that's

71
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,730
doing all the hard work and getting the

72
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,710
success and the true self isn't able to

73
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,000
take that on board and what that means

74
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,350
is you feel like and I'm possibly

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,540
because it's not your true self that

76
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:55,820
you're attributing the work so what

77
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,130
happens is everybody kind of sees these

78
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,720
things on the outside right so your

79
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,760
knowledge your experience your skills

80
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,500
your abilities and they just see you as

81
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,679
one person right then I see is this

82
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,140
false person and this true person but on

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,340
the inside you have trouble correlating

84
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,570
these things with yourself it's kind of

85
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,100
the opposite to Dunning Kruger

86
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,560
which you may have heard of it's a

87
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,049
little bit more widely known so Dunning

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,630
Kruger is like you know we all know

89
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:25,669
people like this right where they think

90
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,630
they know everything and they know

91
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,970
anything

92
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,430
nothing imposter syndrome is the

93
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,770
opposite where you actually know the

94
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,770
things but you think you don't

95
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:43,420
so this is how it starts is a and

96
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,099
impostor syndrome cycle and normally you

97
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,700
start off with an achievement related

98
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,590
tasks okay so you might be at work you

99
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,210
get a task from your boss you decide to

100
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,520
apply for a new job

101
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,810
your wife wants you to build a know a

102
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,820
cubby house or something you start

103
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,910
feeling anxiety and self-doubt a little

104
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,790
bit of worry about this task and then

105
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,380
normally one of two things happens you

106
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,710
either go down attractive over

107
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:15,550
preparation so you know this is your

108
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:20,289
perfectionist needs to be 100% golden

109
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,210
golden nugget or you put it off and you

110
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,990
leave it for as long as you can because

111
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:30,039
you don't really know where to start you

112
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,720
actually end up completing the task and

113
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,760
you have this great big feeling of

114
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,560
relief oh I've done it awesome

115
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,409
except you then start getting some

116
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,410
praise for that task and you start

117
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:49,510
discounting that feedback so you might

118
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,860
say things like ah well you know anyone

119
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,230
could have done it if they put in as

120
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,550
much effort as me and it tends to be the

121
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,580
kind of thing that you might say if you

122
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:00,510
come down the over preparation path all

123
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,950
you might say oh yeah I was just lucky

124
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:06,130
I've heard that a few times this weekend

125
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,550
all right oh yeah I just stumbled across

126
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,870
this O'Day I was lucky all right didn't

127
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,030
take any skill at all

128
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,150
a three-year-old could have done it when

129
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,070
really you know that's not the case what

130
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,489
happens then we discount this feedback

131
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:24,030
and then that feeds back into our

132
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,980
perceived fraudulence or our fake self

133
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,049
we increase self doubt we get my anxious

134
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,750
and in some cases that can lead to more

135
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,270
serious things like depression what

136
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,820
happens next is really cool or maybe not

137
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,830
so much because you start again all

138
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,360
right you get a new task and then you

139
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:44,400
start worrying and you start feeling

140
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,400
anxious and you go through that cycle

141
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:52,450
so what kind of people get impostor

142
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,290
syndrome and impostor syndrome it's not

143
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,140
really a syndrome

144
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,360
technically apparently syndromes like

145
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:02,159
Ana medical term like I said I'm not an

146
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,210
expert it's more of a phenomenon or

147
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,070
sometimes it's called impostor feelings

148
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:11,500
but most people know that it's imposter

149
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:14,380
syndrome it can't happen to for a number

150
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:19,210
of reasons so it could be who knows

151
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:22,120
maybe a stressful job cloak warming your

152
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,049
crazy parents and there's actually one

153
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,720
of these things that's the root cause

154
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:31,300
it's your crazy parents so you can't

155
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,960
actually blame your parents and family

156
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:39,970
in this so thanks mom and dad

157
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:42,520
appreciate that so how does it happen so

158
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,980
you're a little kid right and your

159
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,440
parents that said things like ah you're

160
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,240
so smart you could do anything you put

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,070
your mind to

162
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,690
stuff happens really easy for you you

163
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,190
know you knew two languages you could

164
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,520
count to ten before you even came out of

165
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,530
the womb like you are awesome and you're

166
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,070
like oh yeah okay and you're like yeah

167
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,679
this stuff's cool but then one day it

168
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,550
actually isn't that easy it starts

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,110
getting hard but your parents are saying

170
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:15,550
hey man like you find this stuff so easy

171
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,750
and you have to do some work now I

172
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,390
certainly remember when that happened to

173
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,300
me when I kind of realized I had to

174
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:25,390
actually do some study to pass exams

175
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,390
like that was tough I couldn't just

176
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,880
remember what the teacher said and what

177
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,559
happens is you're like wow my mum and

178
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,520
dad are saying that this stuff should be

179
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,319
easy but it's not and they're also

180
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,299
telling me that I'm really smart so

181
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,670
maybe I'm not and you start the

182
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:47,079
self-doubt cycle right and it kind of

183
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,520
continues as you go through and you

184
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,770
start working harder and harder and

185
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,449
harder and harder because you want to

186
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,850
try and live up to the expectations that

187
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,340
your parents and family are setting so

188
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,410
you work hard at it and then they see

189
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,870
the results

190
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,469
look how easy you find it like man I'm

191
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,510
working hard and you work harder so the

192
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,630
other way it affects you as a kid is

193
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,700
when you're not that smart person it's

194
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,160
when you're the other one all right and

195
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,790
your parents say things like ah you're

196
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,319
the pretty one you're the life of the

197
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,810
party you're the funny one

198
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,040
you know either socially adept one you

199
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:27,390
got all the friends that the good wines

200
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,599
and what happens is a lot of the time

201
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,240
you're actually has smart maybe smarter

202
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,280
than your sibling and you know I'm gonna

203
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,870
show Mom and Dad I'm gonna show them

204
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,720
that I can do this stuff that my brother

205
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:43,050
and sisters doing so what happens you

206
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,790
start working hard and you start working

207
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,160
really hard and you start getting

208
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,349
results and sometimes you get better

209
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,530
results than your brother or sister but

210
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,960
your mum and dad don't acknowledge it

211
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:58,040
all right they don't say oh how smart

212
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,480
are you they say oh oh you're so funny

213
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,640
and you go home and they'll work harder

214
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,590
make them notice me and you're on this

215
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,170
quest for acknowledgement so there are

216
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,330
some other causes and a lot of the time

217
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,650
from what I can tell these childhood

218
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,660
things kind of lay dormant until

219
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:20,699
something else kind of triggers it so

220
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,530
the cycle so you know you're starting to

221
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,230
feel anxious and you get yourself in

222
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:30,870
that cycle and it kind of escalates from

223
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:32,850
there also the need to be special or the

224
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:37,950
best and you can kind of see that coming

225
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:39,390
out of that second scenario as a kid the

226
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,120
characteristics of a Superman or

227
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,699
superwoman like I kind of fit in this I

228
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,440
think where you're trying to be the best

229
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,750
that you can be across like the 60

230
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,220
million different things right so you're

231
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,720
working really hard at work because you

232
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,160
want to be the best at work and then you

233
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,970
come home and you're trying to be the

234
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,800
best dad ever

235
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,450
and you're trying to be the best husband

236
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,849
ever and you're trying to be the best

237
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:04,020
everything you know and there's only so

238
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:09,840
many hours in the day fear of failure is

239
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:11,699
another thing that can drive this also

240
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,209
and the fear of fail is like we're that

241
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,759
progress

242
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:16,109
nation thing comes in sometimes right so

243
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,069
you don't actually want to start doing

244
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,999
something because you're afraid you're

245
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:25,498
gonna fail at it and then your denial of

246
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:27,509
ability in the scanning price so and

247
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:30,269
then there's also the feeling of fear or

248
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:33,420
guilt about success and in the original

249
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:37,290
research is a different time back in the

250
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,748
seventies this was a lot of rounds woman

251
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,699
in particular not feeling comfortable

252
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:47,399
that they were successful because it was

253
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:48,990
seen that successful women were not you

254
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,179
know like motherly and loving that

255
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,240
they're hard and driven and that wasn't

256
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:58,019
really traits that people particularly

257
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,509
wanted so it affects a wide range of

258
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,329
people so different races different

259
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,939
sexes different backgrounds cultures

260
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:12,359
countries it's pretty much a universal

261
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:15,618
thing and it affects high performance so

262
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,480
you know sports people we've got

263
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:21,569
successful business people entrepreneurs

264
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,589
you've got doctors and surgeons you've

265
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:26,998
got teachers and lecturers academics and

266
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:30,559
you know InfoSec professionals like

267
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:32,639
yourself so Einstein

268
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,920
most people would reckon he is probably

269
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,769
one of the most clever people in the

270
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:42,290
whole world right across time and you

271
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:44,189
can see from the quote that he's kind of

272
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:48,299
experiencing some of these impostor

273
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:50,939
syndrome traits right he's like seeing

274
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,720
himself as a swindler you know as his

275
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,740
Einstein

276
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,819
if anyone knows stuff it's him right

277
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,709
how's this fascinating the rest of us

278
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:00,809
feel I've pulled out a couple other

279
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:03,689
famous people so you've got Mike Myers

280
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:06,029
right and depending with you like Austin

281
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:10,170
Powers or not you might not think that

282
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:12,089
he's got any talent at all and you know

283
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,569
personally I think I liked him better in

284
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,299
Waynesville

285
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:17,040
but anyway you guys are lucky I had a

286
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:20,579
whole presentation with Austin Powers in

287
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,560
it for my sect aux so they suffered

288
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:25,599
through that sorry guys

289
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,680
Emma Watson from Harry Potter there's

290
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,810
another one and JLo you know like she's

291
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,550
she's pretty successful I think most

292
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:37,540
people would argue but she doesn't feel

293
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:40,150
like it so how many people experience

294
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,339
things like this so I do a little

295
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:46,540
experiment

296
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,400
I reckon probably about here so

297
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,160
everybody that side just put up your

298
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:55,300
hand alright so we'll be wrecking this

299
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:58,390
about it's about 15% so if you think

300
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,650
it's more than 15% of people I want to

301
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:07,140
here say more okay are you ready go if

302
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:11,590
you think it's less let me hear say less

303
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:16,270
no no one thinks it's less okay so let's

304
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:21,790
go these people over here ends up so

305
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:23,790
that's that's like 40% do you reckon so

306
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,099
if you think it's more than 40% say more

307
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,890
do you think it's less well there's a

308
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:35,230
couple of people all right now let's go

309
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:38,770
over to about here so if you're on the

310
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,600
side hands up I reckon this about 70

311
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:44,110
percent right if you think it's more

312
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,900
than 70 percent say more if you think

313
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,670
it's less interesting

314
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:54,280
most people agree is actually 70 percent

315
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:58,150
different research that figure moves

316
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,920
maybe down to 60 maybe up to 80 so those

317
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,560
70 percent people put your hands up so

318
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,969
you imagine if I said if you guys feel

319
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,280
like this go on that side of the room

320
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,940
and if you don't go on that side that's

321
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,079
what it would look like all right so

322
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,090
it's one of the things with imposter

323
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,170
syndrome there's a lot of people think

324
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:19,600
they're the only people that feel like

325
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:22,660
that when an actual fact they're not so

326
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,890
there's some traits that we kind of have

327
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:29,439
come out that it's our subconscious way

328
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,560
of trying to work ourselves out of the

329
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,660
cycle right and one of those is

330
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,560
diligence and hard work so

331
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:41,170
this is where I kind of fit in mostly

332
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:45,550
you know I try and be a hundred percent

333
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,719
of everything you know I kind of think

334
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,550
back to the time when I was trying to

335
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,830
learn InfoSec in as short a time as

336
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:54,490
possible as deep as possible

337
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:56,950
across everything from red team to blue

338
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,710
team to reverse engineering to

339
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:02,170
governance to you know you get the idea

340
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,210
right there's a lot of stuff and you

341
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,160
just work and you get home from work and

342
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,290
then you study and you're sleeping you

343
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,420
dream about it and then you wake up and

344
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,920
you eat it for breakfast and that's just

345
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,209
you just got that one-track mind right

346
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,910
you're just trying to get all the stuff

347
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,710
in and what I realized after listening

348
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,040
that podcast is I've actually working to

349
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:24,300
somebody else's expectations all right

350
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,920
that I thought one of my previous bosses

351
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,400
needed me to you know do some more stuff

352
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,490
and get some more qualifications to kind

353
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,160
of prove out where I need it to be and I

354
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:40,660
was just working all right no fun for my

355
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,310
wife that's for sure so the idea is that

356
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,530
you're trying to work and fill that gap

357
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,930
between your true self and your fake

358
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:50,260
self and so trying to merge those

359
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,939
together but remember that fake self is

360
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,460
somebody else's expectation of you all

361
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,150
of the time and it's not necessarily

362
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,920
based on real life either

363
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:02,290
track number two is funniness and

364
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,438
inauthenticity so this is an interesting

365
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:08,139
one it doesn't kind of play out the way

366
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,040
that I thought so this is about being

367
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,600
inauthentic

368
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,369
about your comments right about what you

369
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,010
say and what you do so you might be in a

370
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:20,169
meeting and everyone's talking and

371
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,089
brainstorming and if you demonstrate

372
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,680
this trait what you'd normally do is

373
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,530
just agree with everyone all right

374
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,010
because you don't feel like your opinion

375
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,300
really counts for that much right

376
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,879
because you've got this feeling of fraud

377
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,510
you're like I don't really know you know

378
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,340
I'm not that great at this thing I just

379
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,190
won't say anything and then I won't get

380
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,040
found out all right and this can be a

381
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,400
problem sometimes because you know your

382
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:51,720
boss may have hired you for those ideas

383
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,640
and if there's a proportion of the team

384
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,680
with this train it just ends up being

385
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,980
the boss's idea that gets put through a

386
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,380
lot of the time we like our bosses but

387
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,080
some of their ideas need a little bit of

388
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,700
work a little bit of help but if we're

389
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,520
not giving that to them because we don't

390
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:13,600
feel like we have the experience to do

391
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:17,410
that it can cause trouble the third

392
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,570
track is charm and perceptiveness so

393
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:23,440
this is where you end up sort of going

394
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,120
well look if they find me out because

395
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,970
I'm a rubbish infoset guy

396
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,399
maybe they'll keep me on because I

397
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,930
organize morning tea every week and I'm

398
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,120
on the Christmas party and the social

399
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,130
club and I'm helping out this department

400
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,590
with that thing and I'm doing you know

401
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,990
the this thing and you you go off and

402
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:45,010
you find all these other things to get

403
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:47,050
busy with so that you know you got a

404
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,570
back-up plan if they find me out they'll

405
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,330
keep me on because on you know a nice

406
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,189
guy and I do all this other stuff but

407
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,960
what happens is you go off and you do

408
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,310
those things and then you start feeling

409
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,620
like a fraud doing those things alright

410
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,389
so then you're gonna find more things

411
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,129
don't you feel like for doing those and

412
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:10,540
you get is just a cycle you just gotta

413
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:13,500
round and round and these things in here

414
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:17,110
as well you know Chum you're trying to

415
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,490
you know be everybody's friend which can

416
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,260
sometimes lead back into that

417
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,470
inauthenticity one where you don't want

418
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:27,460
to say your idea because you might not

419
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:31,090
want to upset someone giving it away

420
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,650
there okay so is impostor syndrome a bad

421
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,500
thing a good thing or somewhere in the

422
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,540
middle well it kind of depends right so

423
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,610
there's a lot of successful people that

424
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,670
feel like this and it actually drives

425
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,800
them to some of those successes so it's

426
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,570
not entirely bad it can help you get out

427
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,810
of bed in the morning and can help you

428
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,030
get stuff done but if it's not managed

429
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,440
and you get into that cycle and you're

430
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,690
going around and around and around and

431
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,340
around you can actually end up being

432
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,230
back so it can lead to things like

433
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,230
chronic anxiety and depression

434
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,998
all right so I see the audience

435
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:07,859
participation so we're actually gonna do

436
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,119
a survey so I know all of you will

437
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,489
probably have your laptop or your phone

438
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,570
and now's the time to get it out now

439
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:16,769
this is going to be a non anonymous so

440
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:20,899
don't panic I'm not recording any

441
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:25,109
details so if you go here so tinyurl.com

442
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:27,029
/ JP - crikey or if you really want the

443
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:31,859
QR code should work so I'll give you a

444
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:34,529
couple of minutes so what we'll do is as

445
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,960
we go through the talk you guys can fill

446
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:39,090
this out is 20 questions the idea is

447
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,649
that you just go through you know

448
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,369
straight off-the-cuff don't think too

449
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:43,639
much about it

450
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:47,369
Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam so I meant

451
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:50,219
and then later on we'll have a look at

452
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:53,369
the results and the reason one of the

453
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,840
reasons for doing this is I have a

454
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:57,330
feeling that info sex a little bit

455
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,850
different and I'll explain my reasons

456
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,949
why but I couldn't actually find any

457
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,320
evidence to back it up so I thought

458
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:07,259
while I was here I do a quick little

459
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,749
survey and see if I can find some of

460
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,309
that evidence so you guys might prove my

461
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:14,029
theory is wrong you might prove them

462
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:16,259
right or we might be on the fence

463
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:21,269
because you know we don't want to

464
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:24,539
project our opinions alright so there's

465
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:26,730
like a scale of 1 to 5 ones not at all

466
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:31,019
true face very true you get the idea

467
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:35,159
right so why do I think that people in

468
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:42,450
InfoSec might experience this a little

469
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:45,509
bit more so well first of all InfoSec is

470
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,820
a really deep field I think right it

471
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:49,769
covers a range of talk on it elaborated

472
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,080
on this Elliott a range of topics right

473
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:53,789
so you've got the guys configuring

474
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,699
appliances they're kind of in the

475
00:21:53,789 --> 00:22:00,419
security industry we've got guys running

476
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,129
exploits for binary we've got I know

477
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,929
dudes that are like reverse engineering

478
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:06,119
and that's their whole you know their

479
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,909
whole life is doing reverse engineering

480
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:10,859
so we have this really broad spectrum

481
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:12,480
and a lot of the time we kind of

482
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:13,600
expected to know how all these bits fit

483
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,430
in together

484
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,530
especially if you're working on defense

485
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,690
but it also happens on the offensive as

486
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,420
well right so as a pen tester you kind

487
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,510
of expected to know if a customer comes

488
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,930
up how to pen test that application in

489
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,520
that language on that hardware all right

490
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:33,610
as a defender you're expected to be able

491
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,330
to defend against whatever attack of the

492
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:39,040
day you know whether it's spectra you

493
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,379
know like you gotta go talk to your boss

494
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,770
about CPU architecture and whether we're

495
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:47,140
at risk of this thing or not and you

496
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,780
know that's not my background so you've

497
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,850
got to go and drama at these things out

498
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,310
also the rate of change is something

499
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,350
else that I think plays into this

500
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:58,629
because you can actually sit down and go

501
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,320
well okay you know this is gonna happen

502
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,300
this is gonna happen

503
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,200
so I need to learn these things because

504
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,490
you don't really know what's gonna

505
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,740
happen all right

506
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,150
somebody might come up with some DNS

507
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,130
rebinding attack that you've never heard

508
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,300
of and then you gotta go and search your

509
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:14,530
infrastructure to see if you're

510
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,270
vulnerable to that all right this is

511
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,270
also something else is comparing

512
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,100
yourself to others right so you might be

513
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,670
seeing they're working I'm working and

514
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,230
working on something and you're looking

515
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,050
at everybody else that's having success

516
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,510
right you drop an ad on Twitter and

517
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,460
you're like man it's so easy for them

518
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,490
I've been doing this thing for like at

519
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,800
least a month I can't get anywhere and

520
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:40,240
what you don't see is that behind that

521
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,180
O'Dea that they just dropped on Twitter

522
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,100
there's like 5 6 10 years 20 years worth

523
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:50,770
of effort and background that's gone

524
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:53,320
into that our adversaries are also

525
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:56,290
something else that I think is different

526
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,120
in InfoSec right so I bet you've

527
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:01,420
probably got friends that aren't in the

528
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,870
industry and I bet you they don't get

529
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,430
out of bed in the morning jump up all

530
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,199
right

531
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:12,000
North Korea here I come I'm taking you

532
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:14,440
on man and then when I'm done that

533
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,450
organized crime I'm gonna slow you down

534
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,950
yeah but that's us right you know if if

535
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,210
you're a library and you're probably not

536
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,240
thinking that in the morning

537
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,679
you're just gonna go and do some books

538
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,389
or something right I don't know

539
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:34,950
I'm sure it's I'm sure it's more than

540
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:37,899
that so another thing is diversity so

541
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:40,990
it's not the amount of diversity it's

542
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:43,418
the lack of diversity so for example I

543
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:46,779
can't look around the room there's a lot

544
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:49,269
of people that can't look like me so if

545
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:50,379
I'm someone in information security and

546
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:52,830
I don't look like me

547
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:55,240
and look like everybody else in the room

548
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:58,559
and I already have these impostor

549
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,789
feelings and I feel like I don't belong

550
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,980
and I can't see anyone else that looks

551
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:07,149
like me that just reinforces that bias I

552
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,249
have right and this is kind of going

553
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:11,320
back to that original research in 1978

554
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:15,429
that clients in homes did around women

555
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,168
and their impostor feelings it's still

556
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:20,019
current today but it's not just women

557
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:22,840
it's different cultures races all sorts

558
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,159
of things so I think that's why it's

559
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,189
really important things like the Crocky

560
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,269
women event a run so that if somebody is

561
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,980
feeling like that they can look around

562
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:30,759
the room and go you know what I do

563
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:37,149
belong here

564
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:39,639
all right I'm nervous I'm thinking more

565
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:41,649
than once all right so how do we fix it

566
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:43,449
well hopefully we haven't employed this

567
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:48,189
guy because he's not the sharpest nail

568
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:54,879
in the toolbox I don't know I liked it

569
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:57,070
right like what is he doing we can't

570
00:25:54,879 --> 00:26:01,240
actually fix it but we can manage it

571
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:03,360
right so we don't do it with Bitcoin

572
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,200
whiners

573
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,959
it seemed to be the answer for

574
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:14,049
yesterday's because section so we do it

575
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,659
by recognizing patterns and if you're

576
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:21,070
thinking it kinda looks like a magic eye

577
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:22,990
picture who knows but by recognizing the

578
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,570
patterns of impostor syndrome you can

579
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,889
actually start to manage it you can

580
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,928
recognize when you start having these

581
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:30,908
feelings you can make a choice whether

582
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:32,799
you want to act on them or not like I

583
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:33,840
said sometimes it's a good thing it gets

584
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,049
you out of bed in the morning

585
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,779
but sometimes you just need to kind of

586
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:43,158
take a break and reset otherwise it

587
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:46,169
leads to two bigger problems

588
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,940
you can also reframe your beliefs so

589
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:50,880
this is about scripts that run in your

590
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,230
head and what you believe right so one

591
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,520
that I realized because I've been

592
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,559
thinking about this since listening to

593
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,190
that podcast one that I realize a head

594
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:02,600
was that if I don't IT at uni instead of

595
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,679
business I know how to code right

596
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,928
everyone knows that's what you do means

597
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:11,460
for you know if they go to uni has 15

598
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:13,620
bucks you're done but I realized that I

599
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,149
wasn't actually going out and learning

600
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,830
how to code even though I wanted to

601
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:19,590
because I had this belief in my head

602
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:22,770
they said that I can only do it if I had

603
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:24,830
done it at uni which is you know I'm

604
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:29,520
sure you guys agree that's not sensible

605
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:31,949
but by identifying them these scripts

606
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,559
that play in your head you can change

607
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,980
them and you're like right logging on

608
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,899
here we go

609
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,419
notice your tendency to compare so we

610
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:45,479
touched on this before with the

611
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,740
boyfriend mean so if you are going to

612
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,049
compare yourself to other people make

613
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,390
sure you got the full story don't just

614
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:54,690
look at their manicured social media

615
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,850
site all right but for the most part

616
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,830
it's probably best not to you shouldn't

617
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,330
be sitting there going well you know

618
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,799
so-and-so had been in jail for two years

619
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,559
and then they got this promotion I

620
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:09,840
should too right make sure that you're

621
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:11,100
comparing yourself to actual facts also

622
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,830
note your reasons for not accepting

623
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,299
feedback all right so that feedback that

624
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,939
you get that you discount note the

625
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:20,129
reasons why so if you say you know hey

626
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,010
dude good job on that thing and you go I

627
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:25,320
was just lucky or congratulations on the

628
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,059
new job oh you know I was the only one

629
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,860
in the company so they just gave it to

630
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,970
me all right

631
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:34,500
hear yourself saying these things write

632
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:38,820
me down and then what you can do is you

633
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:41,610
can go back and try and reframe them you

634
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,840
can also say thank you and it's just an

635
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,789
easy way to stop that script from

636
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,110
playing hey do you congratulations on

637
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:51,419
the new job thank you

638
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:55,620
job done all right you stop the script

639
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:59,730
easy-peasy also commit to authenticity

640
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:01,330
so if somebody asks you for your opinion

641
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,890
within reason

642
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,320
you know pitch it to the right audience

643
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,880
but if someone asks you for your opinion

644
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,289
don't just say echo theirs back at them

645
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,120
because there's probably not what they

646
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:13,210
want they probably actually want to hear

647
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,039
what you think and unless you do that

648
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,350
you'll never have your opinions

649
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,200
validated so you'll never actually know

650
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:21,610
whether you've got good ideas or not

651
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,080
because you just regurgitating somebody

652
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:28,928
else's and another thing that we can do

653
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,460
is talk about it and this is you know

654
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:33,429
one of the main reasons that I'm here

655
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,740
today is that this was a takeaway from

656
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:38,260
that podcast I was like all the easiest

657
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:42,309
things to talk about it I need to talk

658
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,720
for Crocky Khan so let's do this one and

659
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:47,168
it doesn't have to be in front of a

660
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,639
whole audience that's probably you know

661
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:51,789
hit the answer my impostor syndrome I

662
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:53,350
was taking on too many things but it

663
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:56,139
can't just be one on one or in a small

664
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,699
team back at the office it's kind of

665
00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:00,850
like the boogeyman right if you turn the

666
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,340
light on and open the door it's just a

667
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,260
hat and a coat there's nothing more than

668
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,090
that all right and it's the same a

669
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,010
little bit with impostor syndrome if you

670
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:12,360
open the door and look at it you go yeah

671
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,360
okay it's not that scary after all

672
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:20,519
shall we see our results

673
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:20,518
hopefully other better than brexit oh

674
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:31,928
well done 139 awesome all right so I'm

675
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:35,110
not gonna read all these out because

676
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:36,220
that would be tedious but as we just go

677
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:40,000
through you've read all the questions

678
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:44,649
you can't have every going so from

679
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,070
memory one is not very often and five is

680
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:52,989
all the time so you can see for most

681
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:58,689
people it's in this four column isn't it

682
00:30:52,990 --> 00:31:00,000
like 52 all right so what's that 37% and

683
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,210
30% that's

684
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,889
almost 70% of people think that they got

685
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,159
a job because they're in the right place

686
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:11,309
or that you knew the right people right

687
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:16,769
say look at this it's backing up what I

688
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:21,470
thought this one is interesting this

689
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:23,789
one's kind of being the other way but

690
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,980
interesting factors that I thought my

691
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:30,929
university entrance was attributed to a

692
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,789
mistake so I had a friend that applied

693
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,289
for uni as well and I actually Adam

694
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:36,809
finish school year I was it like a year

695
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:39,240
early and I put in because I had enough

696
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:42,690
at school and I got in and she didn't

697
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,490
and she was pretty smart and I kind of

698
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,529
mean you know what must be because I put

699
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:50,240
my name first and the class had filled

700
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:50,240
up before they got to hers right

701
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:03,100
so I think we can agree that as a group

702
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:06,390
there's probably a few of us here that

703
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,389
have experienced some of these feelings

704
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:15,370
you're all a bunch of hyper-competitive

705
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:20,428
weirdos if that last ones if I'm not the

706
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:22,719
best I want to die but that's it like

707
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:26,320
we're all competing against everybody

708
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,019
else but not a truthful level where

709
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,510
we're trying to outdo social media

710
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:34,950
profiles and all sorts of crazy things

711
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:38,789
so here we go just to summarize

712
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,789
recognize the patterns okay

713
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:46,389
reframe your beliefs so that's about

714
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:51,610
those scrips notice your tendency to

715
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:55,269
compare note your reasons for not

716
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:56,649
accepting feedback say thank you it's a

717
00:32:55,269 --> 00:33:02,440
really good one to try and get out of

718
00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:05,080
that excuse script commit to

719
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:09,669
authenticity so make sure you submit

720
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:13,500
your ideas and discuss with others so in

721
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:13,500
a nutshell that's how we can manage it

722
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:21,428
so what next where we go from here well

723
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,168
like I said before I'm not an expert if

724
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:26,559
you want to do your own research Google

725
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:28,779
imposter syndrome with clients and Iams

726
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,658
so they're the two ladies that did the

727
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:33,970
first bit of research into this and

728
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:35,620
another one is Jordan Harbinger so he

729
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,690
has a podcast that's the one that I'll

730
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,000
listen to I think he probably does a

731
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:44,190
much better job than me but maybe that's

732
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,480
just my imposter syndrome again and

733
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,880
maybe when you're on your drive home

734
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,760
tonight and that white line stretched

735
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,760
out in front of you you can think back

736
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,279
over some of your experiences and see if

737
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,860
they line up with imposter syndrome

738
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:02,020
thank you

739
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,020
[Applause]

740
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,560
as someone who's completely

741
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,480
non-technical who spent 18 years in a

742
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,799
technical discipline I have no idea what

743
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,668
impostor syndrome is like at all huh she

744
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,240
should have come with a trigger warning

745
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:23,639
that one it's funny right because I

746
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,020
remember speaking to someone recently a

747
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,270
good friend who was feeling a little bit

748
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,380
anxious about their job right I said

749
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,489
worried are they're gonna they're gonna

750
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,350
bundle me out of here I was like

751
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:32,489
imposter syndrome all over this is

752
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:36,839
someone had known for a long time very

753
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:38,790
very capable with an unusual skill set

754
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,830
that was perfectly like fitted to this

755
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,168
job as well so I said to them as a

756
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,460
management position big deal job and

757
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:46,049
actually managed to really help them

758
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,100
with it but by one thing and I think

759
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,260
it's a question that a lot of people

760
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:52,230
could do well to ask themselves just I

761
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,550
said okay who else can do your job if

762
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,860
you were to leave tomorrow who else

763
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,360
would you hire to do your job and they

764
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,280
start rattling off these names with

765
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,170
people who are like you know running

766
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,060
very successful businesses like people

767
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,070
who are doing other right I said

768
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,660
okay let me rephrase who would you hire

769
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:12,990
to do your job who would actually take

770
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:14,580
your job ah yeah it's a question like

771
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,109
it's a question I think a lot of people

772
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,270
can really do well to ask themselves

773
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:22,980
sometimes it's an interesting point so

774
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:25,980
recently I had a task to actually hire

775
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:28,590
somebody to fill my job for about three

776
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,440
months and I had to write a position

777
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:33,300
description because I didn't have one at

778
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,700
that point and actually going through

779
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,980
and writing out what it is that I wanted

780
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,779
somebody to know and do on God's green

781
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,080
earth and do all of these things yeah

782
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:47,340
and I was like holy crap you know I

783
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,259
actually do know a fair bit of stuff so

784
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,450
that's a good point and maybe you know

785
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,090
that's some homework for people no yeah

786
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,759
try to try to a managed you know imagine

787
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:59,870
your replacement who's got questions

788
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,870
anybody we've got one over here

789
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:05,140
for excess wandering advice and maybe

790
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:09,759
don't want answers but what about steam

791
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:11,799
cleaners people men team what can they

792
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,600
do about it so the question is what can

793
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,280
team leaders do to help people on their

794
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,360
teams who might you know be obviously

795
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,360
suffering from impostor syndrome

796
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:35,670
yeah yeah so yeah like let's take the

797
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:37,509
the team leader part first so I think

798
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,000
there's a couple of things that we can

799
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,500
do I'm a team leader myself generally

800
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,330
speaking and I like I said someone else

801
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:49,150
is doing my job for a bit so good luck

802
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:51,670
to them thanks Jamie so yeah what we can

803
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,080
do if you do recognize that I guess one

804
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,670
of the things is to talk about it and

805
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,850
you don't have to single that person out

806
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:00,330
and go hey I think you feel like a fraud

807
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,100
and they're gonna go huh

808
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:05,890
good job I make all those cakes cuz I'm

809
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:09,940
about to get it alright but it may be

810
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:11,410
bring babies maybe bring it up right and

811
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,520
say hey I'm into this talk are keep

812
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,319
going and talking about this thing and

813
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,670
bah bah bah bah bah how do you guys feel

814
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,060
about that you know is this something

815
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,070
that you guys feel about and also and

816
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:25,150
you know I have thought about this like

817
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:29,560
trying reinforce for your team we do see

818
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,820
them doing good work so hopefully you

819
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,860
can kind of do that it can it be as

820
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,270
simple as just one on one sincerity by

821
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,860
calling someone in and saying look you

822
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,840
know sometimes I feel like maybe you

823
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,260
don't realize that you are in fact doing

824
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,780
a good job and you know these these five

825
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,310
things that you've done recently like no

826
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,410
 you're actually doing a really

827
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,880
good job you know and I just know that

828
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:51,220
and feel that I mean can it be as simple

829
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,170
as that or is that Zack to him it can

830
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,700
yeah and you know like those scripts

831
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,590
that you have in your head you'll

832
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,270
actually hear other people say alright

833
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:01,030
like I said I heard some of them up on

834
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,030
stage over the weekend we're going I was

835
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:05,050
lucky and I feel on that thing all right

836
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,270
that's the kind he and say well no

837
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,860
actually that took a lot of skill

838
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:10,340
there's a lot of people that wouldn't

839
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,770
have been able to do that and

840
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,640
that's a complicated thing right like

841
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,900
you're talking to someone who's

842
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,529
basically won the cosmic lottery

843
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,140
job-wise

844
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,010
you know with anyway that's a whole

845
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,960
other conversation

846
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,930
I'll just we've got a bottle of scotch

847
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,920
and I'll sit there weeping about it does

848
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,919
anyone else have a question

849
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:40,010
but but if you apply too many times

850
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,010
so now Jeremiah

851
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,699
ERD

852
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:50,700
no way

853
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:54,090
having identified so in that environment

854
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:58,430
in fact you really get to sell yourself

855
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,430
on the bicycle no I'm not

856
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:05,030
it is so how do we rephrase that

857
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:11,060
question I think something about talking

858
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:18,710
to your boss you know intergenerational

859
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:20,330
aspects - how do you convince someone of

860
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,560
their Worth and of course you know we

861
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,660
haven't even had the conversation about

862
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,070
like when humility is actually justified

863
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,540
right because you know it's all very

864
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,280
well and good for everyone to claim I

865
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,570
think it's sometimes good to recognize

866
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,830
that we've been lucky I don't

867
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,250
necessarily think that that's a really

868
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:36,380
unhealthy yeah everything you're saying

869
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,050
is put down to like then of course yeah

870
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,130
of course all right well I think it is

871
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,020
actually time to bring on the next talk

872
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,780
everyone thanks good they don't see the

873
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,559
highway

874
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,559
[Applause]
