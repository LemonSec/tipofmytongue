1
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,820
my name's Simon Harvey I'm here as an

2
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,279
individual I have to say this my I'm

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,860
speaking on behalf of myself not my

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,660
employer I'm really really scared of the

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,800
HR forms but also there was an

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,440
interesting thread on Twitter this week

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:41,750
I was last Monday kicked off by this one

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,550
this tweet was really a go at the RSA

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,280
Conference for having that whole stream

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,370
of mental health talks and there's

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,850
actually some very good arguments on on

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:55,220
both sides on whether non-professionals

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,300
should be talking about mental health so

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,980
I am going to play that fine line I'm

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,110
here as an individual I'm a normal

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,520
security guy and I'm saying that in

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:10,250
quotes for the people who work with me I

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,798
do have a basic mental health first aid

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,240
accreditation through mental health

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,729
first aid Australia off the books

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,810
somewhere but still if I accidentally

22
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:23,000
veer into my own history I'll try not to

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,130
this advice is general it's in surrender

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,740
to search what works for me may not work

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,479
for you which is I'll try Nevada if I

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,880
did for this exact reason that's on the

27
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,250
right if you're affected by this by

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,360
anything we've talked about today

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,690
there'll be some contacts on the slide

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,580
or I'll be around afterwards and I'll

31
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,908
learn to turn the screensaver off as

32
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,000
well so impostor syndrome here we go

33
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:50,260
again

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,320
click so wise mental health an issue

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,210
well back in 2011 I need to find some

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,070
updated stats it was the third biggest

37
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,490
cause of death and disability in this

38
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:04,429
country so by disability is unable to

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,048
work not the traditional physical

40
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,810
disability that we think of

41
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:15,110
that's after cardiovascular and health

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:17,000
and cancer in though in those in 2011 it

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,700
was roughly about one in five people

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,860
would be diagnosed with a mental health

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,989
issue by a medical professional by a

46
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,650
doctoral psych

47
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:29,440
so I'll come on so I'm a Susskind slide

48
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,690
and about one in 10 of those

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,730
only about 2% of the population which is

50
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,650
still too many would be diagnosed with a

51
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,119
severe mental health problem this is

52
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:44,410
getting into the suicidal attempts

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,930
extreme psychosis etc but what I noticed

54
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,790
in a previous employer who senses all

55
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,400
all the management layer into mental

56
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,660
health first aid training so it wasn't

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,660
just the people at that employer I

58
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,180
worked out which was in workplace health

59
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,740
insurance it was also I looked round to

60
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,900
me looked around at my peers in the

61
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,960
industry thought about myself my own

62
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:09,430
history and realized that mental health

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,680
issues extremely pronounced in the IT

64
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,430
sector but then there's one particular

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,930
segment of that InfoSec where we do we

66
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,480
do have a lot of mental health issues

67
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,370
fortunately there's a lot of deaths in

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,869
our industry particularly in the US

69
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,220
there's a lot of depression and these

70
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,940
sets of figures are actually more

71
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,560
generic they're across the the whole of

72
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,460
the whole of society in Australia in

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,230
2011 I think it was but well the one in

74
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,640
five I mentioned there's a

75
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,600
disproportionate amount affecting

76
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,989
females over males in general they found

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,570
that males tend to suffer the stunt the

78
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:53,200
standard mental health issues anxiety

79
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:57,030
depression bipolar but a high proportion

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,920
had substance abuse disorders it's water

81
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,890
alcohol drugs whether that's illegal

82
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,280
drugs prescription drugs and they tend

83
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:09,160
to make the ultimate sacrifice and

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,580
suicide quite young before they're

85
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,180
around 40 what the research found which

86
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,000
shocked me and the researchers is this

87
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,280
column those one in five and this was

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,450
back in 2011 remember not knowing are

89
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,729
today the female the females are

90
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:32,020
researched a lot high proportion of

91
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:34,780
anxiety depression and bipolar and in

92
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,240
general a lot higher mental health

93
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,000
issues

94
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:43,280
then the mill cohorted any female in the

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,380
room would probably be look at me going

96
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,469
welder but you know what the

97
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:51,560
government's like that's what they found

98
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,440
was that men tend to internalize it use

99
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,460
drugs use alcohol prescription drugs non

100
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,750
prescription medication and their lives

101
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,500
females tend not to and they're not

102
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,990
entirely sure why the theory being is

103
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,729
it's trying to be the matriarch of the

104
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,099
family trying to be the strong one

105
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:14,120
because the husband or the father or the

106
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:15,770
boyfriend has taken that sacrifice the

107
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,430
reason matching is that they carry this

108
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:24,139
on in general to their dying day so from

109
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:26,569
around 40 to 90 93 that's 50 years of

110
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:29,270
suffering with poor mental health in

111
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:33,770
general and stuff all supports in

112
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:35,659
Australia for women over 40 because the

113
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,539
media governments politicians they're

114
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:40,810
focusing on the suicide rates and the

115
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:44,110
the younger generations and the males

116
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:48,139
that makes headlines sports people

117
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,449
University students politicians but not

118
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,219
here so it's just something I want to

119
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,979
leave someone would leave you all with

120
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:57,080
that 40 minds that mental health is

121
00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:00,680
definitely not male issue it's

122
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,810
definitely not an only female issue but

123
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,919
those are suffering are suffering mostly

124
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,500
in silence and believe me I was one of

125
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,750
the male's suffering I know many females

126
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,860
that are and really have no one to turn

127
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:18,289
to which is part of this windiest talk

128
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,900
well why is it issuing in the cybers is

129
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:21,800
it because of who we are about

130
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,258
personality types a lot of as a

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,270
perfectionist

132
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,770
luckily the talk this morning from from

133
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,979
John from John Peter think of us

134
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,508
imposter syndrome so a lot of people in

135
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,729
this room were nodding this morning in

136
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:38,479
that talk I think I'm suffering it right

137
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:41,900
now to be honest in my day job I'm an

138
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,250
architects and architects we were

139
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,219
apparently we know everything but

140
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,199
there's a lot of this in India but is it

141
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:49,110
the next work we do risk management we

142
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,630
always see the bad

143
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,240
stuff but very rarely see the good stuff

144
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,740
for those of us are in consulting see

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,390
lots of bad stuff everywhere in

146
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,730
operations my god I don't know how you

147
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,060
deal with it I just hear about it from

148
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,560
you guys also it's associated industries

149
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,330
for those in the room who are not

150
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,120
cybersecurity people but in aligned

151
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:14,510
industries in legal consulting sales

152
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,650
recruitments they're suffering too and

153
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,960
because we are so focused on trying to

154
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,179
get our day jobs on we're actually not

155
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,219
treating these people who we work with

156
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,610
for the same suspect we should be our

157
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,920
own colleagues isn't about the

158
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,260
professional precious never one in the

159
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,830
bar put the beer down for a second the

160
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,890
cyber cyber dance we think cyber all the

161
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:41,159

cultures you know you get shots you just

163
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,300
you get shot you get your if you raise a

164
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,280
risk if you find something but in your

165
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,290
organization are you the one that's

166
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,179
going to have to deal with it you've see

167
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,860
it through to resolution so the number

168
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,450
of organizations in Brisbane that

169
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,870
actually out that way so a lot of people

170
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,900
keep this to themselves customers going

171
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,250
why can't you just let me put that web

172
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,710
server directly on the internet with no

173
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,400
firewalls and no monitoring because

174
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,870
those guys are and from a perspective

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,909
why don't they listen we can see all

176
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,220
this bad stuff happening in our day jobs

177
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,900
we can see the train coming down the

178
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:21,030
tracks is going to derail we can see the

179
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,250
high risk medium likelihood high

180
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,409
likelihood of something bad happening

181
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,380
cosmas being great customer data being

182
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,270
breached until emails going but the

183
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,729
business don't care so we tend to take

184
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,659
this on as a burden ourselves are we

185
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,690
actually doing this to ourselves as well

186
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:43,228
for those who work in the supply chain a

187
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,150
lot of customers including where I work

188
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,530
we're becoming a lot much more difficult

189
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,120
client we're actually putting stress on

190
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,030
our supply chain on the people who work

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,100
there and their supply chain so those of

192
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,390
you who work with me in current and

193
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,560
previous roles I'd do that through

194
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,810
really bad dad jokes that's

195
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,900
to hide all of the other stuff but

196
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,189
really we actually do forget that when

197
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,900
we outsource when we have managed

198
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,580
services when we get consultants in

199
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,110
we're putting them under a lot more

200
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,420
pressure than what we would have been on

201
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,870
they're doing in-house we forget

202
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:18,880
everyone's we're all people too and a

203
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:20,110
lot of suffering in this space so what I

204
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,370
mean by mental health issue

205
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,350
well there's various definitions I've

206
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,520
put some represents at the bottom the

207
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,140
way I'm going to define them in this

208
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,050
talk our mental health problem is a

209
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:36,550
decline of good mental health it's just

210
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:38,740
not having normal day-to-day life things

211
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,040
are getting on top of you there's family

212
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,050
issues as work issues but it's what we

213
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,579
all go through and if someone says they

214
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,280
don't have this at any point in their

215
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,290
life they're lying to you but most

216
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,449
importantly a mental illness or a mental

217
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,730
health condition is the diagnoseable

218
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,160
medical condition by a medical

219
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,290
professional that causes a disability

220
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,360
that's the World Health Organization's

221
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,860
definition there just took the person

222
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,270
ability to work carry out daily

223
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,580
activities and engage in satisfying

224
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,750
personal relationships so there's

225
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:14,580
nothing in there about physical

226
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,540
disability or mental disability that is

227
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,000
the definition for the World Health

228
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,160
Organization this affects a person's

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,710
thinking emotional state one's own

230
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,569
behavior and it's that behavior one I

231
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:30,850
want everyone to think about because

232
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:34,330
those on the Left they're examples of

233
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,580
poor mental health which most likely

234
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:41,380
some people in the room suffering now

235
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:44,680
have suffered those on the rights are

236
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,480
diagnosable mental conditions the stuff

237
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,150
that makes the headlines the stuff that

238
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,070
actually is difficult to talk about but

239
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,620
there's I don't know if it comes up on

240
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,570
the slide very well can I want tell me

241
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,710
what the difference is between the ones

242
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:01,960
on the left and the ones on the right no

243
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:05,950
it's not coming up

244
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:11,650
it's they're the ones on the left you

245
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:14,170
need help for as well yeah yeah I've

246
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:17,400
grouped them on purpose because the only

247
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,660
real difference between these two

248
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,939
depression the fleeting suicidal

249
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,310
thoughts the starting to plan if you're

250
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,130
going to go down that roads and the one

251
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,810
on the rides there's only well there's

252
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,900
actually three key differences the

253
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,430
duration how often you feel that whether

254
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,180
it's becoming all-consuming you thinking

255
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,069
24/7 is opposed to a short period of

256
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,719
time

257
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:45,580
frequency every day all the time and

258
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,970
severity this is where we're starting to

259
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,880
take action on those thoughts this is

260
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,490
where when we as people trying to look

261
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,560
out for each other in the office when

262
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,030
someone's behavior changes they're not

263
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,050
coming up to lunch with you every day

264
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,880
like they used to

265
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,890
they're spending a bit more time on the

266
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,370
phone they're a little bit distracted a

267
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,900
bit zoned out this is these are some

268
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,510
symptoms of these things on the left

269
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,490
starting to take hold and what I want us

270
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,860
to do as a community is get better at

271
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,290
looking out for these and try and

272
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:23,050
encourage people to get help before it

273
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:24,550
turns into the ones on the right I said

274
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,130
I wouldn't use an example I'm going to

275
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:31,329
use one when I was suffering poor mental

276
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:34,030
health 15 years ago I had to manager a

277
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:37,990
consulting firm that really wanted to

278
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:41,020
help didn't know how he got his manager

279
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:45,900
to come up to me and ask me is

280
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,900
everything okay have you found God which

281
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,330
his meanings were well intentioned watch

282
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,450
young half Muslim half Catholic

283
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,980
both my parents families have been you

284
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,990
know death threats and all that of all

285
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,210
through our life probably not the thing

286
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:09,040
to give a religious thing to someone

287
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:12,220
who's going towards this side and yeah

288
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,560
so even though the intentions were there

289
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,129
how we approach how we actually offer

290
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,959
assistance

291
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,589
which I want going stakes that games the

292
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,779
treatment side is actually important

293
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:27,139
I'll give some tips on that

294
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:29,839
but luckily few Crikey's ago Eric who

295
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:32,930
will be on a bit later today he came up

296
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,620
with the paradox paper foul food seven

297
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:39,319
seen this one before so his theory is

298
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,189
that 80% of security technologies are

299
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:44,360
there they're trying to fix that part

300
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,860
fixing technology problems sell me a

301
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,399
nice shiny box put a firewall in the

302
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,480
front will be secure jobs a Gooden 80%

303
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:56,540
of security problems are down here

304
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,809
people are he called it lazy but what

305
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,660
she meant was demoralized unfocused got

306
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:04,459
the mind on other things so when the

307
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,319
security guys have continually beating

308
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,859
up the users for not using strong

309
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:13,759
passwords or clicking on fishing links

310
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:19,040
is it because they're malicious most

311
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:23,120
likely not is it these demoralized too

312
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,599
busy have trying to get their job done

313
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,970
and what we're doing is security people

314
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,309
putting in strong passwords not putting

315
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,689
out single sign-on multi-factor we're

316
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:35,120
making their lives harder so they're

317
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:37,610
trying to actively bypass that who's got

318
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,050
those exemptions for USB keys because

319
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,069
it's too hard to get data transferred on

320
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:45,949
your network there you go the other ones

321
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:48,439
people make mistakes people do make

322
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:51,378
mistakes technology is there to help but

323
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:54,500
if you're if you as a person have got

324
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:57,230
other things going on in life these

325
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,470
things we're secure professionals need

326
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,779
to be aware that not everyone's one

327
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,819
percent thought active every day they

328
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,449
may be going through other problems at

329
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:11,089
home or at work

330
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:12,410
Oh organizational culture as well a lot

331
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,749
of us are in organizations where you've

332
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,209
got to deliver more bigger faster

333
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:20,360
quicker cheaper yesterday Security's in

334
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:23,420
a way what workplace support is now and

335
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:27,420
there's no one here from HR any HR

336
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:30,599
function no see one person lovely

337
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,430
a lot of human resources of functions

338
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,019
that I've worked with they actually want

339
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,329
to talk about this they want to equip us

340
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,620
in actually being able to spot each

341
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,229
other in offices they're

342
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,610
resource-constrained as well

343
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,540
the lawyers won't let them do this

344
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,130
budgets occur so there's a wider

345
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,240
organizational issue as well but it's

346
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,100
not something we can solve it's

347
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,240
something we can advocate for may be

348
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,970
using our industry as an example but as

349
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,170
I was updating slides this morning I

350
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:01,740
don't know how much at the news in the

351
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:05,550
past ten minutes is it on so now we've

352
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,709
got no election yet so last time I gave

353
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,389
this talk in Melbourne I was on World

354
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,040
Mental Health Day no one in the room

355
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:14,100
actually knew it was world mental health

356
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,019
day that day the Australian government

357
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,850
on an allowance day Productivity

358
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,220
Commission review into mental health in

359
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,899
Australia that's supported by both side

360
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,610
of politics and it's going to look at

361
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,620
the commercial world what are employers

362
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,660
not doing or doing what they should be

363
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,660
doing so I'm quite hopeful that the

364
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:33,300
employer community will over time before

365
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,339
step up but also government's as well

366
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,060
and as we saw in the election in the I

367
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:41,730
mean the budget a couple of days ago

368
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,138
Sims with a 7 million whisk it was put

369
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,269
aside for mental health and suicide

370
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,670
prevention programs a lot of that is

371
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:48,740
going to a charity called headspace

372
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,810
don't know if anyone's familiar with him

373
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,569
headspace are a fantastic organisation

374
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:58,099
who give mental health support 16 to 25

375
00:16:54,569 --> 00:17:01,410
year olds only they do online counseling

376
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,930
they help teenagers in particular and

377
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,399
the younger generation gets pot that

378
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,990
they feel they feel they can't get

379
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,880
through anywhere else they're gonna be

380
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,890
expanding I believe those services to

381
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,949
the adult community as well so you can

382
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,169
get support from trains counsellors not

383
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:19,039
just some guy on slack or on the

384
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:22,470
internet or fire a Google search which

385
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:27,449
emerged in half day that's excellent

386
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:30,240
news yes he was 12 men those they yeah

387
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:32,520
things so saying that random guys on

388
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,549
slack the intersect communities actually

389
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,658
been doing quite a lot in his space and

390
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:39,210
here in Australia we're only just

391
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:40,260
starting to see that so it's a non aware

392
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,309
of info sanity

393
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:47,250
- awk so infacility dog is a group of

394
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:50,668
our peers in the u.s. I believe shut

395
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,559
Jack Daniel's one of them malaria a lot

396
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:55,140
of the personalities

397
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,510
they've gone quite open and actually

398
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,340
explains their mental health problems

399
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,410
their journey which is where some with

400
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,510
blowback is or what work for me might

401
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,160
not work for you but on there they've

402
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,750
got people there's people who are not

403
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,330
health officials just security people

404
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,190
like you and me they're there to listen

405
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,710
the slack channel invite-only to get

406
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,450
keep the trolls out but yet there are

407
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,950
people that work with it working

408
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,330
actually that know what we're going

409
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:24,260
through at least as a sounding board

410
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:26,428
Mental Health First Aid Australia I'm

411
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,340
there one of my favourite ones I must

412
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,929
admit a lady called Betty Kitchener

413
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,750
who's not a social psychologist on a

414
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:35,490
nurse back in 2010 realized we've got

415
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,549
this crisis in Australia set up this

416
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,040
foundation to Train employers on how you

417
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:44,250
can train your people to look after each

418
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,470
other better it's a two-day course it

419
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,320
cost quite a bit of money but they're

420
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,020
very nicely released a booklet on the

421
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,659
kindle for $5 which gives you a little

422
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,820
bit of guidance in support or if I

423
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,740
suspect someone in my workplace on my

424
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,439
family is suffering an issue how do I

425
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,390
approach them how do I offer advice what

426
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:09,540
do I say it gives you a bit of

427
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:10,679
ammunition to help you in that and yeah

428
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,080
I've told my boss I want to become a

429
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,090
trainer in this space because I'd rather

430
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,500
do that then my next steps are costs I

431
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,990
think firstly I would rather go down

432
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,309
there as well and um see help

433
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,010
open-source Mental Health Initiative

434
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:25,530
that's an IT wide one they've got some

435
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,570
nice publications on lean pub which is

436
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,639
donation where she's actually quite good

437
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:33,120
for the cios the CTOs

438
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,410
the HR functions of well how do I deal

439
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,479
with mental health issues in the

440
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,549
technology part of my business what

441
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,470
should I be thinking of that's an open

442
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:42,990
source initiative on get books I think

443
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,850
but it's actually bottom up against IT

444
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,580
guys trying to educate businesses that

445
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,379
you need to do something about this once

446
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,649
on the right though I'm especially proud

447
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,650
of

448
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,660
you probably know couple years ago I

449
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,879
winced a lot to Asia or certain crikey

450
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,360
after too many beers saying I want to

451
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,470
talk about this and instead of pushing

452
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,459
me away they went yes yes I'll give you

453
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,890
all the support you need and help you

454
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:16,140
and he was worse even better what can

455
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,140
you do to help us so I'm trying to get a

456
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,250
community of us together to actually

457
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,370
improve how we deal with mental health

458
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,170
in our sector so I'm just one person

459
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,169
there are many others who are doing

460
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:31,170
doing things in Australia

461
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,850
Betty kitchner and mr. young who sort of

462
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,240
mental health affairs in Australia their

463
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,100
son works come off bangies but I'll eat

464
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,140
that on so used to run just wife David

465
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,030
John for those who know him he's a

466
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,260
trainer in this space he's been trying

467
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,330
to get this message out for years as

468
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,900
well so when I look up to for the work

469
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,840
he's done but also what we do just as a

470
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,220
function of the community these four

471
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,010
it's actually making a lot of difference

472
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,110
so I meant to a few students I've been

473
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:01,230
told by a number of students in the past

474
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,000
couple years that what they found best

475
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,930
from the mentoring program to the QUT

476
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,280
Yuqing Griffith run is the people that

477
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:10,860
are working with them are actually

478
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,990
helping them with panic attacks mental

479
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:17,360
health issues the fear of trying to get

480
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:19,080
work in our sector NIT that one on one

481
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,330
cut one on one

482
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,679
collaboration is actually helping even

483
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,810
though we might not be experts with our

484
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,510
sense of community is really helping

485
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,399
each other say it's okay to not be okay

486
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,410
I don't want to say that phrase but

487
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,200
there we go it is okay to be not okay

488
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:37,710
and it's okay to ask for help

489
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,540
ma WS n is an amazing organization again

490
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,940
not sort of for mental health it's to

491
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,159
set up it's set up twice you provide a

492
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,040
peer forum for women in security we've

493
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,050
heard some of the challenges quite

494
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,300
disgusting challenges that women do face

495
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,919
but that peer network peer support

496
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,820
network is helping a lot of people get

497
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,810
through and for the men men shed I've

498
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,460
not been to one

499
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:02,669
my dad has and he keeps going on at me

500
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,290
about it but that's because I'm own

501
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,090
steel Muhammad yoga back

502
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,520
back off them and get my headshot gear

503
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:10,830
running again with you with me for those

504
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,190
who know someone know who with you with

505
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:18,060
me is again there's go on one little

506
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:20,850
wave up there with with me help train

507
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:24,560
people from one career stage to another

508
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:27,209
they do a lot from ex defence personnel

509
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,399
they don't do mental health specifically

510
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,290
but providing that community that peer

511
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,960
engagement they're actually helping

512
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,950
people get through the transition that's

513
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,110
something that we are absolutely

514
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,090
terrible in an IT within our own

515
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,580
community to go from ops to security or

516
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,110
security management so it's a lot we can

517
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,620
learn from these guys as well as

518
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:49,229
supporting each other the big fault at

519
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,729
the bottom the big for support fighters

520
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,150
they in the past few years they've

521
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:57,240
actually realized that's IT hospitality

522
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,100
and eighteen thirty year olds are three

523
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,870
biggest s-- sufferers upon mental health

524
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,120
in Australia well that's more likely

525
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,320
twelve to thirty year olds now so we're

526
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,419
starting to see some programs

527
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,100
particularly beyondblue are actually

528
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,420
trying to target what we're doing

529
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,429
hopefully we'll get some of those to a

530
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:15,060
conference like this in the future to

531
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:16,830
actually see what the experts in the

532
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,020
mental health space can do to help us

533
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:23,159
and vice versa as well it's for us to

534
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:25,620
all support each other through this so a

535
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:30,090
few platitudes there I'm afraid but what

536
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:32,909
can we do for ourselves well and I'm not

537
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,860
I'm at work talking about life so in

538
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,260
your peers managers friends client

539
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,889
service writers most importantly your

540
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,560
loved ones friends family children when

541
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,120
I was doing research for the previous

542
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,520
slide this morning there's a

543
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:52,679
heartbreaking story on the ABC website

544
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,780
about a father who is pleading for us

545
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,190
all in Queensland in particular to

546
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,490
actually keep an eye out for our

547
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:03,120
children his 12 year old attempted to

548
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:06,420
end his life a few months ago he was he

549
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,899
was brain dead for eight minutes they

550
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:12,360
brought him back and quite luckily no

551
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,720
brain damage he was making a full

552
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,830
recovery and this poor father is blaming

553
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,489
himself because he didn't see

554
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:24,059
the signs so 12 year old 12 year old and

555
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:27,159
younger are actually suffering with this

556
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:28,690
making attempts so the first thing I

557
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,489
would look for and what he's trying to

558
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,830
campaign for say it's on the ABC News

559
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:35,710
website today look for changes in day to

560
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,629
day behavior someone not engaging as

561
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,100
they normally do in the office not the

562
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:40,809
temp not coming to lunch with you not

563
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,360
coming for a coffee when they used to do

564
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,489
that children withdrawing into

565
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,580
themselves spending more time in their

566
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:50,859
room I'm on the phone on the computer

567
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,189
that is when that is the time to get

568
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:57,039
advice that's when your head spaces

569
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:59,769
lifelines your GP is your best friend

570
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,970
here what can I do I suspect something's

571
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:05,220
going on but I don't know how to

572
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:07,480
approach if if you don't feel confident

573
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,399
that's the first persons call if your

574
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,340
GPS doesn't care or is no interest or

575
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:14,129
too busy find on the GP because really

576
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,539
stuffs too important

577
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:19,119
what should we do miles industry should

578
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,759
we be training ourselves better should

579
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,499
we as IT people start to dispel the myth

580
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,720
that we can't talk about this and

581
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:27,789
actually support each other I've taken

582
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,789
my awkward hugs to band off but Vaughn's

583
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:34,059
an all-star hug more than happy but it's

584
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:36,429
really to we're all people we got what

585
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:38,470
we do in our day jobs we need to look

586
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,789
out for each other because for those of

587
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,749
us have gone through this we don't want

588
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:45,009
you to go through what we've been

589
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:45,850
through the actor mrs. Doubtfire who's

590
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:48,429
the actor last year

591
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:51,070
Robert wind Eames his quote was the

592
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:52,570
reason why people advocate for the stuff

593
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,009
we've been through the pain you don't

594
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,559
want the single person's go through this

595
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:59,019
ever again there's a goal you'll get

596
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,080
there eventually the big - I like for

597
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:04,179
actually how do you do that first

598
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,899
approach are you okay I okay to hog-tie

599
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:09,669
you to actually take someone aside ask

600
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:12,758
how you're feeling

601
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:15,700
be prepared for when they say no but

602
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:18,340
when you they do say no listen don't

603
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:22,149
talk just let them speak don't push them

604
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:24,249
to speak more than they want to what

605
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:27,158
works for me may not work for them so

606
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:29,499
don't give advice on treatments have you

607
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,489
found God if you drive mindfulness

608
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:33,589
mindfulness doesn't work for me I know

609
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:38,209
but I do know it works extremely well

610
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:40,940
for other people encourage action so the

611
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:43,609
person who's suffering needs to be in

612
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,769
control that's extremely important

613
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:48,708
encourage them to seek help to speak to

614
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:50,959
their GP that's probably the key once PT

615
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:52,969
GP or call one of these numbers which

616
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:55,369
I'm gonna give you on the next slide and

617
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:58,099
check-in how are you going for a coffee

618
00:26:55,369 --> 00:27:00,019
don't force the issue some people it

619
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:02,509
takes you it's quite slow some people

620
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:04,729
it's quite quickly in my case it was ten

621
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:08,779
years and I wouldn't be standing here

622
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:10,899
now if someone didn't do this to me the

623
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:13,579
Mental Health First Aid your approach is

624
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:16,428
pretty much exactly the same for

625
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:20,209
encouraging support peer support as well

626
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:22,369
I say contact me offline if you need

627
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:24,739
some more links but there will wait you

628
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:27,070
slides in this talk verbal and they'll

629
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:30,109
be on the website they stop learning yep

630
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,809
so I know we're over time a little bit

631
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:35,809
so I've got five minutes I guess for

632
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:38,799
questions but one plea if you could all

633
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:42,200
or most of you take those phone numbers

634
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,719
put them in your phone and QR codes are

635
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,399
not quick rolls I promise I did check

636
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:47,629
them before I came out today no one's

637
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,649
got no ones and the man in the middle of

638
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:52,639
me if not only for you or your family

639
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:54,408
for your friends for your work

640
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:56,059
colleagues it's at least

641
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:58,849
chrissteele you'll see someone who's

642
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:01,129
suffering when you least expect it being

643
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:02,570
able to whip out phone and say for an

644
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:06,529
eight twelve to twenty five-year-old or

645
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:08,029
now a bit older headspace is fantastic

646
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:11,419
they've got trained counselors there

647
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:12,559
from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. I think it is

648
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:16,429
online and by phone

649
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,899
beyondblue and lifeline 24/7 and this

650
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,999
lot this last one at the bottom I didn't

651
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:21,889
get permission to add it there's someone

652
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:25,179
in our community I don't know who it is

653
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:28,129
but the people that told me about this

654
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:31,789
I've got no reason to not trust them is

655
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:34,549
suffering they they are on the

656
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:36,139
right-hand side of that diagram they are

657
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,869
trying to get professional help they

658
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:40,279
can't afford professional help so

659
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:42,269
instead of that extra beer tonight

660
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,190
it can chuck $5 $10

661
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:47,039
go fund me I know a few people in the

662
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,109
room already half think they're trying

663
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,080
to raise about $25,000 for the help they

664
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:58,168
need I think that's a biscuit we can get

665
00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:00,589
today so any questions round of applause

666
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,589
for Sami
