00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,270
[Applause]

2
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:25,189
okay so thank you all for coming along

3
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,230
firstly because I know that a mitre

4
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,000
attack high-level overview

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,230
yeah it doesn't sound like the most

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,180
appealing talk to give you some context

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,730
as to who I am where I'm coming from a

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,160
PJ manager of cyber intelligence working

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,890
for Symantec what does that mean they

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,989
don't let me near sales that we're

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,540
focused very much on an internal

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,390
security protecting Symantec from people

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,430
coming after it two and a half years in

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,590
cyber Intel in the Australian financial

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,290
sector and five and a half years working

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:00,290
for the Australian government I'm really

17
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:03,050
looking at the lens of being a cyber

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:05,059
noob but also looking at the looking

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,990
through the lens of the operational to

20
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:11,899
strategic landscape trying to stop the

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:15,679
attack bingo card from coming along

22
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:18,680
before it comes along the scope of

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,720
course I'm very very biased not aimed at

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,820
a technical audience anyone in this room

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,010
could certainly bury me if we started

26
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,479
talking technical and that last talk

27
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,990
frightens me and that guys never taught

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,869
touching my laptop thinking very much in

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,820
that adversary centric mindset I'm all

30
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:37,420
about the person behind the keyboard

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,270
trying to figure out how they think and

32
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,860
who they're going to come after and the

33
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,479
standard disclaimer last two points

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:49,039
there so again the background we all

35
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,289
know why we're starting to use

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,180
frameworks and things like that one of

37
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:57,110
the things that I really like about the

38
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,900
miter attack framework is the pitchers

39
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:03,500
right risk teams are starting to

40
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,900
understand it sometimes can be a good

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,449
thing but it's becoming a common

42
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,349
language that is at the right level for

43
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:16,189
inter organization and intelligence

44
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,659
sharing within teams as well the reason

45
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,720
why I'm saying that it's at the right

46
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,980
level is that if you go too deep when

47
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,650
you're starting to share intelligence

48
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,190
about some sort of an incident that

49
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,740
you've seen

50
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,630
you start giving away how to hack into

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,090
your network you start giving away your

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,310
company vulnerability but if you

53
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,880
abstract back to that moderate AK level

54
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,070
and a little bit deeper you start being

55
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,130
able to share some actually interesting

56
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,440
and relevant experiences and it's

57
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,690
starting to really solve that problem of

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,810
the poor communication leading to some

59
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,520
real significant failings naturally ever

60
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,300
in the room thank you for putting your

61
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,850
hands up everyone understands it it

62
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,400
really is that Babel Fish and again that

63
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,980
not too detailed it's rapidly becoming

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,480
another industry standard doesn't take

65
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,060
away from the work of the various in

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,030
Quebec frameworks but again I think it's

67
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,150
that abstraction back which is letting

68
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,640
us use this talk to management and talk

69
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,130
to people who are less technical by

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,890
nature and by trade but they're the ones

71
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,290
making the policy decisions that are

72
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:30,109
affecting all of our lives all of the

73
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:33,109
time particularly when it goes bad this

74
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:35,600
is certainly my opinion I think that

75
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,640
hunt operations detection engineering

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,700
incident response plans in play books

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,160
and especially cyber intelligence should

78
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,679
all use the mitre attack framework as

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,440
much as humanly possible because then

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,600
everyone's speaking the same language if

81
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,510
someone's talking about a particular way

82
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,850
of doing something or pretty much

83
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,019
anything we're all starting to speak

84
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,359
that same language

85
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,340
I've seen a number of failings before

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,770
both in my time in government as well as

87
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,690
my time out of government when one

88
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,590
organization is talking to another

89
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,540
organization using a common term the

90
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,100
trouble is is the definition of that

91
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:17,570
common term between the two

92
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:20,019
organizations is entirely different and

93
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:24,349
that can certainly lead to some

94
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:26,810
suboptimal outcomes and also it can help

95
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,640
educate management this is going to be

96
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:32,900
the ongoing theme throughout the

97
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:36,030
presentation itself and it's trying to

98
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,820
get the security community to get ahead

99
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,159
the bingo card message to get ahead of

100
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,200
what's happening and where the industry

101
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,960
in general is starting to move and

102
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,450
trying to stop my manager from turning

103
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,039
around and going I want a tick in every

104
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:55,530
box on this particular grid and again

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,930
the bias attacking itself has some bias

106
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,299
the size and scope of all the different

107
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,190
techniques naturally definitely check

108
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,770
out the attack on videos that are there

109
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,740
and around talking about the depth of

110
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,859
PowerShell for example is really really

111
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,610
relevant a lot of the conversations with

112
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,560
attack also comes to not everything's

113
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,170
relevant to my organization or my

114
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,010
organization needs to work outside of

115
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:25,290
the matrix that's a really good thing

116
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,800
being able to understand that attack is

117
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:31,980
not necessarily going to cover 100% of

118
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,960
everything that you see but when you can

119
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:39,210
and when you can communicate in that

120
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,340
common message use it because it's there

121
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,010
that's certainly relevant depending on

122
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,260
the size of some of the organization's

123
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,000
being represented in this room and some

124
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,400
of the size of the security teams as

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,500
well you will undoubtedly see things

126
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,469
that are sitting way outside the attack

127
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,270
matrix and then when it comes to

128
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,450
actually communicating that message to

129
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:03,810
other organizations that might help you

130
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:06,090
actually sit back and say I need to

131
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,090
define exactly what I'm talking about a

132
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,539
lot tighter and a lot and I kind of you

133
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,250
know define everything a lot more and so

134
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,960
I certainly encourage people thinking

135
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,850
outside the matrix some of the stuff

136
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,859
that we do is set up temporary

137
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:23,460
designators for things that are sitting

138
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,410
outside the matrix so then when might of

139
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,299
themselves roll out a new edition of the

140
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,370
attack framework or something like that

141
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,020
we can translate those temporary

142
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,800
designators back in where applicable or

143
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,830
continue having those temporary

144
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,910
designators it's a bit of an interesting

145
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,289
one and a tricky one to cover as well

146
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,300
the other shortcomings when using mitre

147
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,570
attack analyst shortcomings certainly

148
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,639
including mine automate automate in

149
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,159
being the goal

150
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,139
wouldn't it be great if we could

151
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,259
automate everything trouble is we can't

152
00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:00,650
and of course is it still too high level

153
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:03,560
I tend to think of mitre attack as I'm

154
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,789
going to talk to my supervisors or my

155
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:11,000
seniors I don't think of mitre attack

156
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:14,000
necessarily as I'm gonna present a piece

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,389
of paper matrix to my hunt team and say

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,030
here's how apt 10-roll or here's how

159
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,250
someone operates because my hunt team

160
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,169
will look at that piece of paper scrunch

161
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,689
it up and throw it back at me and say

162
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,810
it's not detailed enough and they do

163
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,849
it's happened so looking at some

164
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,729
hypothetical scenarios I think it's a

165
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:38,060
really nice way to introduce some of the

166
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:40,389
tradecraft that we're using to influence

167
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,000
our management in the correct way

168
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,810
naturally you slide full of caveats

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,669
definitely have a look at your own

170
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,979
Incident Response data I'm going to

171
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:50,810
short-circuit the system and very much

172
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:53,750
use the data that's available from mitre

173
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,849
themselves and some of the things that

174
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,449
I'm going to do is start borrowing from

175
00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:03,199
geospatial analysis people have been

176
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:06,650
reading maps forever some people succeed

177
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,469
some people fail that really matters but

178
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,299
I'm going to start borrowing and

179
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:15,830
stealing from cartographic design

180
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,930
principles map makers their whole job is

181
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,688
putting a piece of paper in front of you

182
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,909
as a manager or as someone who wants to

183
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:25,669
get from point A to point B and achieve

184
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:28,099
a certain goal you need to be able to

185
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:31,310
look at these really quickly understand

186
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:33,799
the message and then make a decision so

187
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,349
I'm gonna start stealing some tips and

188
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:40,189
tricks that I learned back in when I was

189
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:44,540
doing some geospatial analysis I'm gonna

190
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:47,209
do things like present my work on a

191
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,000
piece of paper to my manager and I'm

192
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,040
gonna stare at him the reason why I'm

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,880
staring at him is not just to freak him

194
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,849
out but it's to follow his eyes and look

195
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,800
at where he's looking on the page

196
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,160
and we'll start touching on some of that

197
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,620
stuff as well and instead of saying

198
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,350
defensive posture I'm gonna try and

199
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:12,880
broaden scope a bit to actually include

200
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:14,889
detection as well and I certainly live

201
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,610
very much within the assumed and

202
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:21,370
compromised mindset I just think that

203
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,259
everything is wrecked all the time some

204
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,920
people call it paranoia I call it assume

205
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:29,980
compromise so asking some of these

206
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,829
questions looking very much at my own

207
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,620
organization where do I work probably

208
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:39,459
important who's coming after me and

209
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:42,339
who's coming after my organization how

210
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:44,199
do those adversaries operate how does

211
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:45,610
that align to my data am i seeing the

212
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,920
same thing or am i seeing something

213
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,660
completely different and most

214
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,529
importantly as well how does this align

215
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:55,750
to my competitors data if I'm a bank I

216
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,420
really want to know what's wrecking

217
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,209
other banks not because I can sit there

218
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,819
and go you got wrecked it so I can sit

219
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:06,189
there and say well okay are we going to

220
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:09,370
start seeing some of that same behavior

221
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:12,310
on our networks because that's a really

222
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,259
bad scenario I'm just gonna

223
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,050
short-circuit everything and leave those

224
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:21,040
seeds planted and we'll have a look and

225
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:24,008
see what might I have to say again being

226
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,449
an expand key finance sector Who am I

227
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:27,639
worried about and what am I worried

228
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:32,079
about financial loss naturally being

229
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:34,600
number one Swift ATMs and ATM back-end

230
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,670
infrastructure especially when people

231
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,310
start referring to Swift add to ATM

232
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,719
backing the infrastructures which is it

233
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,839
took me a long time to figure out the

234
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,399
difference there far too long I'm also

235
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,850
worried about the theft of personally

236
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:53,470
identifiable information that can be I

237
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:57,370
don't want customer data stolen but that

238
00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:01,630
should also expand to if I'm running a

239
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:04,000
bank that also runs in another country

240
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:07,630
am I worried about an espionage related

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,939
actor or if I'm a bank moving into

242
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,810
another country am I worried about

243
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,219
someone can

244
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,579
doing some sort of espionage for

245
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,860
competitive game I think that that's one

246
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,980
very very interesting point which is

247
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:24,010
starting to appear more and more is

248
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,180
espionage for competitive game I'm also

249
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,480
worried about intellectual property

250
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,010
theft when I'm talking about

251
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,350
intellectual property within the

252
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,360
financial sector I'm talking about that

253
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,370
big bucket of analytics which has run

254
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,640
over all this excellent customer data to

255
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,710
then try and sell you things being able

256
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,150
to understand and work through that

257
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,500
particularly if you're working at

258
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,640
somewhere like a major financial

259
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:51,760
institution so the first thing I did was

260
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,040
have a look ok let's have a look at a

261
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,050
matrix and attack matrix and I brought

262
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,939
this one up and yes the font is

263
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,040
remarkably small intentionally so

264
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,810
because I'm trying to keep your read

265
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,540
keep your eyes away from the words

266
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,589
themselves this is a comparison between

267
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,930
the Lazarus group and the cobalt group

268
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:16,120
these colors were a terrible decision

269
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:18,459
and think about why I put this in front

270
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,970
of a manager and I said tell me what you

271
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,540
see

272
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:26,950
and he said Green is good I'm detecting

273
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:31,120
everything in green orange red is bad

274
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:33,760
and like our that is terrible a really

275
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,760
really really bad idea because green is

276
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,110
not good but that's the element that

277
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,450
we're dealing with when it comes to

278
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,100
management right I look at a piece of

279
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,800
paper and I just think traffic lights

280
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,650
it's a really nice way of visualizing it

281
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,660
because the colors contrast quite well

282
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:52,420
but my management read it as traffic

283
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,140
lights so that's my failing as someone

284
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:59,560
trying to communicate to that manager so

285
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,660
rather than that I spun things around

286
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,119
and added carbon act just to mix it up a

287
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,990
little bit but I started presenting

288
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:11,410
things in a heat map mode darker color

289
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,510
lighter color a wife's tore red because

290
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,949
red is bad red is something I want you

291
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:20,439
to focus on and I started having a look

292
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:24,040
and explaining some of those core red

293
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,990
bits the actual product that I sent to

294
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,969
the man

295
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:31,390
doesn't I've actually removed all of the

296
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,730
places where there was no scoring and so

297
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,730
my manager only got the actual colored

298
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:39,730
squares this is part of what I mean

299
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,190
about fighting that detection bingo card

300
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,020
if you present your manager with a bunch

301
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,560
of white squares and then a bunch of red

302
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:50,170
squares you manager may look at both as

303
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,790
an equal and valid proposition and say

304
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,819
well what about all these white ones

305
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,620
can't we detect things here okay I'll

306
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,440
just remove them what I'm talking to my

307
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,540
manager because in my opinion that's not

308
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,670
relevant to my network that's not

309
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,740
relevant to my attackers that's

310
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,099
irrelevant information so I'm going to

311
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:13,060
make your job as a manager easier to

312
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,670
focus on what actually counts also we

313
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:20,699
can start bringing out things things to

314
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:24,240
note and very much as a narrative form

315
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,550
looking again at the energy sector I'm

316
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,680
more worried about things like

317
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,959
facilitating disruption intellectual

318
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,479
property theft again theft of personally

319
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,099
identifiable information

320
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,830
hacktivists and things like that as well

321
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,310
there's a different set of threat actors

322
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,170
that operate in a different way for the

323
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,930
energy sector when compared to the

324
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:50,709
finance sector and also when compared to

325
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,959
Symantec where I am now understanding

326
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:55,479
the differences there when you're

327
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,689
looking beyond the commodity level is

328
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,150
very very important and this is where it

329
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,820
almost slides a little bit more into

330
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:06,640
that kind of risk function or something

331
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:10,650
like that looking at an organization

332
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,810
that has targeted industries like mine

333
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:16,120
very very similar scenario right you're

334
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,119
looking at the heatmap style of thing

335
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,310
being able to talk to and articulate to

336
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,459
management the reason why we're seeing a

337
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,050
bit of bias in this heat map as well it

338
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:28,209
may be there's more reporting on

339
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,959
particular adversary sets doing

340
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:32,640
particular sets of activity also keeping

341
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,279
in mind

342
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,010
visibility bias as well just because it

343
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,510
just

344
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,670
because you can't see it doesn't mean

345
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:44,360
that it's not happening Schrodinger's

346
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,160
attack again

347
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,560
that's where little narrative starts

348
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,510
kicking in and the things to note

349
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,910
so they drive by compromise the system

350
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,819
owner discovery and things like that we

351
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,550
can start in a narrative or a sit down

352
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:02,660
session explaining some more of that

353
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:05,109
deeper level knowledge to management but

354
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:08,660
again making sure that we actually

355
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:11,390
translated in such a way there was an

356
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,150
interesting talk that I attended back

357
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:17,530
with the ABC we were putting on a series

358
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:20,030
of podcasts for their science show and

359
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,939
what they were talking about throughout

360
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,839
the podcast series for that evening was

361
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,550
the importance of science communicators

362
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,410
essentially letting the scientist carry

363
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,900
on with the experiment while the

364
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:36,170
communicator stepped up translated what

365
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,000
the scientist was doing to the public to

366
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,120
the management to the people that are

367
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,920
paying for the research trying to

368
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,130
harness the skills of the technical

369
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,050
piece technical people and not letting

370
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,010
them get bogged down in PowerPoint which

371
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:54,469
they'll probably find very frustrating

372
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,930
and again another scenario the

373
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,570
hospitality retail sector theft of PII

374
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,599
point-of-sale compromised credit card

375
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:05,449
compromising theft no big surprises in

376
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,839
the adversary space here this is Big

377
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:11,209
Time meteor it's affecting everyone but

378
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:15,198
it's interesting to see the differences

379
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:17,959
in techniques but more importantly by

380
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,810
reorganizing and reshuffling the way the

381
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,540
modern matrix looks my managers are

382
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,030
getting the correct articulation of the

383
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,879
viewpoint it's really important

384
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:33,139
considering people in Western countries

385
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,320
read from left to right top to down to

386
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,270
actually format the matrix in that way

387
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,639
because I want someone to actually pay

388
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,040
attention to the stop to the top of the

389
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,810
page before they get distracted by phone

390
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,530
call before they get distracted by an

391
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,690
SMS message

392
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,680
something like that I need them to

393
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:55,080
actually get to that point some of the

394
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,200
things that I really want to try now

395
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,240
is mapping all the vendor feeds into

396
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,160
these all the vendors are saying that

397
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,730
they're starting to do attack matrix and

398
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,020
attack mapping so let's give it a shot

399
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,570
adding a lot more of our own incident

400
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,220
data into these mix as well and I want

401
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,250
to see what visibility and collection

402
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,260
gaps start appearing that certainly

403
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,690
speaks to some of that trading is attack

404
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,300
just because I'm not seeing an attack

405
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,540
happening is that a detection problem or

406
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:30,570
is that attack genuinely actually not

407
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:32,190
happening I'm really curious as well

408
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,669
because I'm always thinking in that

409
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:39,150
adversary centric mindset people are

410
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:42,270
creatures of habit they do things in the

411
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:44,490
same way back when I was mulling around

412
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:47,010
with DOS prompts and hiding and unhiding

413
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,650
files because my parents knew how to use

414
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,440
a computer I would sit there I would run

415
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,450
the flags for particular things in

416
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,100
certain ways because that's how I

417
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,590
remembered them and that's what made

418
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,050
sense to me and my brain at the time I

419
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,510
remember talking to one of my friends

420
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,120
and seeing him run the exact same set of

421
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:09,480
the exact same command but all the flags

422
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,699
were in a completely different order and

423
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,950
I was like wow never even thought about

424
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,800
running it that way I was running it

425
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,760
because rash makes in English words and

426
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,409
so therefore that's how I remembered it

427
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,290
but it's things like that I really want

428
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,150
to start experimenting with seeing if we

429
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:32,450
can see a bit more human behavior and a

430
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:36,480
bit more fingerprinting we will achieve

431
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:39,410
peak intel shall we say if I can pick up

432
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,060
an incident response set of reports

433
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,380
gather all of that information and

434
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:48,600
actually group that campaigning together

435
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,540
it'd be even better if then by using

436
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,709
open-source we can start hypothesizing

437
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:57,780
about some attribution and also

438
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,560
prioritizing detection strategies as

439
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,830
well right

440
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,049
if all

441
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:06,730
the adversaries that I think are coming

442
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:09,600
after me will use certain things then I

443
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:12,580
want to be able to turn around to my

444
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,610
hunt and detection team and say maybe we

445
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,220
need to focus on detecting this before

446
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,769
that there's a whole range of

447
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,899
complications in there obviously and you

448
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:25,600
won't be able to just tick through in

449
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:27,879
order one two three four five but it's

450
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,709
certainly some way of prioritizing and

451
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,100
starting to shake out the noise that

452
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:37,330
appears and also the standardizing and

453
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,668
automating for analysis the dream the

454
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:43,149
place where I'd start to think about

455
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:46,389
wrapping up is mainly saying thank you

456
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:48,489
to all the people in this room thank you

457
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:50,889
to the people who run these conferences

458
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:57,279
and thank you to people who are open to

459
00:20:50,889 --> 00:21:00,279
sharing their ideas because I'm not out

460
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:03,450
here by myself I'm standing right very

461
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:06,580
much on the shoulders of giants and I'm

462
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,559
trying to add to that collaborative body

463
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,549
of knowledge which is starting to spin

464
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,960
up and really starting to focus

465
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:16,389
certainly thanks to the guys over the

466
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,399
guys and girls over at mitre for doing

467
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:19,870
things like the attack con putting all

468
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,149
the videos on the internet and things

469
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:25,809
like that the various open-source

470
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:29,370
projects again looking at it from a

471
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:32,019
non-technical new kind of level and

472
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,149
being able to leverage some of the work

473
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:35,559
that already exists and just spinning it

474
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:38,018
round to try and speak to that

475
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:39,789
non-technical audience and most of all

476
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:42,399
thanks to anyone who's actually curious

477
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:44,260
about how things work and stuff like

478
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:49,779
that I did notice in tricks in the badge

479
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:51,039
before but yeah so very fast talk and I

480
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:52,779
know that I've probably thrown the

481
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,320
schedule again looking at Scottie as he

482
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:57,630
stares at his watch but thank you all

483
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,189
for attending as well

484
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,960
definitely I'm curious about taking

485
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,789
questions and I'm curious about hearing

486
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,500
your thoughts particularly when dealing

487
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:09,700
with some of these moderate a key

488
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:12,490
elements and if we start working and

489
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,240
educating and management now fingers

490
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,000
crossed we

491
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,150
avoid the bingo card that will pop up

492
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,900
Jim thank you very much

493
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:30,700
[Applause]

494
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:32,350
we have a question the question was is

495
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,680
the finance sector using this already to

496
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:39,480
share Intel starting to starting to and

497
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,950
it's because there was like a little

498
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,840
Intel sharing community that started

499
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,510
just kind of shrieking about it all at

500
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,550
the same time it's been around for a

501
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,580
while but the last year it's just all of

502
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:53,110
a sudden it is everywhere mmm you know

503
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,449
just as that common language it's been

504
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,790
surprising actually how quickly it's

505
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,500
it's caught on what do you say yeah

506
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,750
definitely and I think one of the

507
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,940
strengths for it as well is that as an

508
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,140
analyst if I look at a really detailed

509
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,210
framework

510
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,730
I'll get locked into analysis paralysis

511
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,770
I won't know if something belongs into

512
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,270
that of that and then my brain kind of

513
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,740
locks up but with the miter attack

514
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,440
framework it's a little bit more

515
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,590
straightforward all right do we have any

516
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,000
other questions

517
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,449
all right everybody please thank Kevin

518
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,980
Cleary

519
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,749
thank you

520
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,749
