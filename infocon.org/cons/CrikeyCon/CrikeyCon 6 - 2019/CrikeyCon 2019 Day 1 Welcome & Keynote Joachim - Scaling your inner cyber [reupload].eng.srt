00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,360
my name is Wade I'm one of the

4
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,890
co-founders along with Glenn in the

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,390
front row here Glenn some a lot of the

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,280
hard work to get this thing happening

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,170
we're really pleased to welcome you

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,620
today to what we think is gonna be one

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,390
of our best troika cons yet troika comes

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,190
a result in Glyndon of Glenda myself

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,450
catching up over a few beers and

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,400
wondering what we can do for the local

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,870
community how can we provide opportunity

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,699
to learn how can we provide an

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,430
opportunity to to meet up and chat about

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,670
stuff and InfoSec and hence Crockett

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,680
Khan was born I won't lie to you the

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,930
first few years were a bit touch-and-go

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,040
particularly the first one we weren't

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,990
sure whether it was just gonna be asked

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,689
to and a few close friends turning up

22
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,360
and that would have been absolutely fine

23
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:09,070
but very quickly we got a fantastic

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,200
dedicated bunch of people to come along

25
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,470
and Crockett Ron's grown year-on-year as

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,840
a result of it so since last year it's

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,369
been a pretty spectacular year in our

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,679
industry has been a whole heap of things

29
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,390
happening we've got even the morning

30
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:24,159
shows talking about cyber security we've

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,639
got so many different it's a new segment

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,899
every other day and probably some of the

33
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:31,929
biggest things for me that have happened

34
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:33,460
in the last 12 months are our Parliament

35
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:35,200
being compromised in some of our major

36
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,490
parties as well I mean it's one of the

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,380
biggest couple of the biggest things

38
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,908
that have occurred which kind of trusts

39
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,770
the people in this room and the people

40
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,899
with this skill set into the line life

41
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,310
not or into the front line so it's

42
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:49,630
really important for us to to have a

43
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,490
good kind of meeting area a good kind of

44
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,589
conference and that's why I'm really

45
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,350
pleased to see the lineup of speakers we

46
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,600
have today I've got a great bunch we've

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,329
got a whole heap aired including Justin

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,770
Stephen we've got Sarah young and we've

49
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,689
got somebody who really kind of just

50
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:10,119
needs one name bit like Beyonce

51
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:11,980
Silvio so but crikey comes more than

52
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,810
just about security it's about also

53
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,010
about giving back to the community and

54
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,810
we're pretty proud of what we've been

55
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,780
able to do in the previous years in your

56
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,370
behalf so last year on your behalf we

57
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,300
were able to donate twenty thousand

58
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,300
dollars to our charities

59
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,840

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,609

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,929
coffee carts we've asked the speakers to

128
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,010
mostly keep it family friendly so you

129
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,200

name is Patrick gray you might know me

152
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,230
from such podcasts as risky business and

153
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,989
it's my job to basically just introduce

154
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,800
the speakers and keep things moving

155
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,110
which is going to be a hell of a

156
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,910
challenge this year because I can't

157
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,880
believe how much great content

158
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,920
crikey Kahn's been able to squeeze in as

159
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,050
Wade just explained the first one I was

160
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,080
there it was a really small little event

161
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,970
it was very informal and one of the

162
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,500
great things that happened at the first

163
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,970
crack econ was it really got quite

164
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,440
interactive there were a lot of

165
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,880
questions and answers coming from the

166
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,969
audience and it really felt more like

167
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,230
you know like a group chat it was really

168
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,030
cool and we like to try to keep that

169
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,940
vibe as much as possible so if you do

170
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,070
have questions assuming we have time it

171
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,500
would be great for everyone to you know

172
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,290
feel free to ask them and it's my job to

173
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,060
try to help help that process kick along

174
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,640
now

175
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,250
before we got get on to the next of the

176
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,050
first talk I should mention them you

177
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,750
know some of the speakers might use

178
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,000
swear words you know if this is likely

179
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,070
to offend you you might want to you know

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,260
see a volunteer about a refund you know

181
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,200
no harm no foul just warning you that

182
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,120
that's something that might happen we're

183
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,460
actually running 15 minutes early and

184
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,990
given the number of talks that we have

185
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,789
to squeeze in I think I might just

186
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,710
introduce our first speaker and we can

187
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,260
go from there if that's all right with

188
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,500
you Glen excellent so our first speaker

189
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,960
is your him Mets he is a Googler

190
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,980
technically a security engineer at

191
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,349
Google with a background in IR and he's

192
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,730
going to be talking to you today about

193
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,250
scaling defense you know we know

194
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:36,370
attackers scale in his talk abstract

195
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,810
you're here mentions that you know

196
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,700
botnets are a great example of how

197
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,320
attackers are scaling things but how do

198
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,110
we scale defense he's going to give us

199
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,440
some examples on that and I think you're

200
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,890
ready to go thank you very much MS

201
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,430
[Music]

202
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,419
[Applause]

203
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:57,949
yeah Thank You Patrick

204
00:07:53,419 --> 00:08:00,878
so my name is yoga mats and roughly the

205
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:03,199
next 45 40 minutes I'm gonna talk about

206
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,000
scaling security from a defensive

207
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,919
perspective I'm not a local for for

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,139
those of you who saw my name maybe on on

209
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,080
on the agenda you might have googled it

210
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,819
and you might have you might have found

211
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,949
a couple of people that that were

212
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:21,770
mentioned as chemistry scientists

213
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:23,990
photographer or a scarf designer I can

214
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:29,060
tell you these are different people so

215
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:31,610
no worries the thing the thing the thing

216
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,649
let me before I go into the presentation

217
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,060
more about about scaling defense I want

218
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,919
to give you a little bit a little bit

219
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,098
about the background who I am and how I

220
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,990
came to information security as a young

221
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,029
young person I was always interested in

222
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,620
in tinkering with Hardware tinkering

223
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:50,959
with software and when you tinker with

224
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,600
hardware and software you'll you'll

225
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,689
notice you find your way around security

226
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,000
controls you like things like savegame

227
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,570
like tinkering with save games or

228
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,600
copyright protections in in in computer

229
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,820
games and I wanted I wanted to kind of

230
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,589
get a professional into that in at a

231
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,600
time but when I started there was no

232
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,350
there was no such thing like a security

233
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,290
engineer job role so I ended up doing

234
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,370
doing being a jack of many trades as

235
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,689
with a soft development a bit of

236
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,779
deployment engineering a bit of system

237
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,160
admin and eventually network engineering

238
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,769
and that was kind of one of the first

239
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,870
first roles that pushed me more towards

240
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,220
information security because as a

241
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,579
network engineer you were responsible

242
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:37,220
for dealing with the firewall when in

243
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:39,199
2005 one of my former colleagues came to

244
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,329
me and said like hey we're looking for

245
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:44,630
people that do that do digital forensics

246
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:46,790
in in in fraud investigations as

247
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,240
consultancy I thought why not that

248
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,240
sounds interesting

249
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,170
the the thing the thing is though if if

250
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:58,230
you if you have done consultancy for

251
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,329
quite a while you get a bit demotivated

252
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,480
the thing is that you go to you go to a

253
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,130
customer you help them out six months

254
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,260
later you're there with the same

255
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,180
customer same problem you have to tell

256
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,970
them the same thing maybe six months

257
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,630
later you have to help them again so so

258
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,430
unfortunately my experience with with

259
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:21,330
consultancy from an instant response and

260
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,920
IDO French perspective was the companies

261
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,410
are not changing during the information

262
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,870
security posture so that was kind of for

263
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,839
me a reason to look for something look

264
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,430
for something else and and I was playing

265
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,410
with the ideas like hey why not develop

266
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,790
computer games because I suppose so they

267
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,579
were so interesting to to

268
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,020
reverse-engineer them or or do some sort

269
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,150
of business for myself but

270
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,329
coincidentally I ended up at Google

271
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,980
Google Switzerland particular thanks to

272
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,710
one person in the room Michael Cohen who

273
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,430
was who we ended up there as well just

274
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:55,380
before me now what I what I started

275
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,180
there was do forensics and instant

276
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,460
response but you have to realize that

277
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,219
Google is a very non-traditional IT

278
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,230
environment if you see and console to

279
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,250
see a lot of Windows ad environments

280
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:11,780
Google environments completely different

281
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:14,280
and and and also just the sheer scale

282
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,250
scale of the matter kind of changed and

283
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,790
changes your perspective significantly

284
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,380
in how to solve how to solve problems in

285
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,270
2017

286
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,240
I don't know of Australia privacy laws

287
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,860
are changing as well but in Europe

288
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,070
there's a GD P R and there was kind of a

289
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,160
strong push in 2017 to be ready for the

290
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,600
for the 2018 deadline my role changed

291
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,069
from not only dealing with security

292
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,160
incidents but now also dealing with

293
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:44,160
privacy incidents and and the TLDR of

294
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,600
privacy incidents is is it's the data

295
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,959
could dedicate a security control

296
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,490
failing besides all besides dealing with

297
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,200
all these organs organs and hectic

298
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,910
things I also like to spend some time on

299
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,580
the on maintaining and developing open

300
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,040
source and I maintain a vast vast set of

301
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,050
open source forensic life forensic

302
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,449
libraries some of you might have

303
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:08,699
stumbled upon before before I continue

304
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,060
I'm gonna have a Ministry of notice

305
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,860
first

306
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,760
I mean you've probably seen this a lot

307
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,399
of a lot of press

308
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,350
patience before is that like as a

309
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,959
disclaimer my opinions are not about not

310
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,389
the opinions of my of my employer but

311
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,250
while writing is I I actually kind of

312
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,949
realized reflecting on is that my

313
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,850
employers have influenced my perceptions

314
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:31,229
of information security over the years

315
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,600
especially in consultancy because she

316
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,300
must see so many different environments

317
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,399
is you get you get you get a lid a lot

318
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,930
of different different perspectives

319
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,170
there and and some of these will be

320
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,138
reflected in the talk today now I can

321
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:49,019
hear you in the room say like hey but

322
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:51,750
like like some of the things I might be

323
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,160
saying my might not be relevant for or

324
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,630
not applicable to the organization

325
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,370
you're currently working for and that's

326
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,860
perfectly fine what are asked of you

327
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,870
what I asked of you is take the elements

328
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,290
of what I'm saying think about it and

329
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,570
think about how how you can use what

330
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,910
isn't relevant to you and you use that

331
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:13,199
to improve information security posture

332
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:16,139
of your organization as preparation for

333
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:17,849
this for this this talk and and I also

334
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,800
kind of read a lot of articles on the

335
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,019
internet like one thing that recently

336
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,779
stood out that I found very shocking as

337
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,910
an internet responder on one side that

338
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,829
means that 2019 is going to be a busy

339
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:33,209
year if this if this trajectory

340
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:35,069
continues but also why why why is

341
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:37,050
information security especially for my

342
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:39,479
defensive point of view still such a

343
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,930
hard thing hard thing to do if we see

344
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,639
like 4.5 billion billion records being

345
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,300
being exposed just the first half of

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,970
2018 so this is kind of the central

347
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,849
question to my to my my thesis here is

348
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,990
this why are our defensive security

349
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,690
practices failing in a lot of

350
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,699
organizations and reflecting a bit of a

351
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,170
bit upon this and and ironically enough

352
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:05,130
this was one of the reasons why I left

353
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:07,319
left consultancy is I think a lot of

354
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:09,959
organizations lack a culture of

355
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:12,209
continuous improvement it is the fact

356
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,930
that we we see security as a one one

357
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:17,579
time salute one time solution that we

358
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,010
need to implement and then continue and

359
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,199
continue on business as usual and this

360
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,050
this is weird because

361
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:29,370
2019 we have more security controls than

362
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:31,829
ever before firewalls client-side threat

363
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,050
against user behavior analysis threat

364
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:37,859
Intel feeds you name it there's more

365
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,079
mandatory and requirements legal

366
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,990
frameworks information security

367
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,529
frameworks ISO Basel 3 if you're in

368
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,660
finance

369
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:50,630
southbend Oxley gdpr you name it like

370
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:54,209
there are a lot of controls but so why

371
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:57,420
why are securities practices still still

372
00:14:54,209 --> 00:15:00,388
a thing that are slacking why did a

373
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,819
bitch is still occurring so what I want

374
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:04,709
to do today is I want to share with you

375
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,160
a couple of things that that my employer

376
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:11,069
has done done over the years to kind of

377
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,889
see how we've been using continuous

378
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,480
improvement across across across Google

379
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:17,790
to improve our information security

380
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,240
posture this mod might give you some

381
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,360
more ideas on how to how to take those

382
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,860
and apply this to your own organizations

383
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,800
so first of all what is continual

384
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,380
improvement it's nothing new it's a in a

385
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,920
nutshell it it it's actually small

386
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:38,760
incremental improvements over time it

387
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,529
there was a book Kaizen in 1986 that X

388
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,680
talked extensively about about

389
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:44,880
continuous improvement now if you're if

390
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,500
you're in if you're doing a software

391
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,240
development you might have also you

392
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,290
might have also heard of continuous

393
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,570
integration continuous delivery

394
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,390
continuous deployment which which are

395
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,829
also implementations of continuous

396
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,839
improvement within the developments

397
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,239
within a software development process

398
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,399
and recent developments like the FA Cups

399
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,910
actually try to execute it as part of

400
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,800
that as well

401
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:10,350
so why how are we applying continuous

402
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,199
improvement in more traditional security

403
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,670
information she could controls do our

404
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,529
organizations have someone that is

405
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,420
actually driving this continuous

406
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:24,240
integration based on maybe the outcome

407
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:26,779
of incidents so one important element of

408
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,860
continuous integration is testing and

409
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,899
it's kind of more an open question for

410
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,940
the room and an open question for for

411
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,750
your organization is that how often do

412
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,390
you actually test your security controls

413
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:41,320
while reading while reading up on a lot

414
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:44,610
of matters funny enough or a bit sad

415
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,660
ironically is that most organizations

416
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:51,160
improve the security information

417
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:54,670
security after an impactful breach which

418
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,610
is too late so what options do you have

419
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,729
to maybe prepare yourself before the

420
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:03,760
breach one thing one aspect could be is

421
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,140
you could use a red team you can learn a

422
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,540
lot from a red team especially a

423
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,829
successful red team put in putting the

424
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,170
information the state of information

425
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,520
security back in perfect back into

426
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:16,180
perspective but also back onto the

427
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:21,879
executive on your under the desk of your

428
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:24,790
executives but as a defender that's only

429
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,430
so much time time to spend so how do you

430
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:30,730
deal how do you effectively deal with

431
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:33,040
with taking the lessons learned of

432
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,480
average taking the lessons learned of a

433
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,470
red team and and actively addressing

434
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,120
actively addressing some of those issues

435
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,860
if you're if you're familiar with

436
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,800
project management you see here kind of

437
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,250
a very kind of rough way of reducing

438
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,750
risks in a project and it's by

439
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,510
four-quadrant rising in impact and

440
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,160
probability now high probability high

441
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,140
impact you probably want to you probably

442
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,240
want to address that directly that it's

443
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,650
the highest priority but then then there

444
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,480
are two kind of areas that are more

445
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,880
problematic as a defender which are the

446
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,860
ones that are low probability but high

447
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,500
impacts and the ones that are high

448
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,790
probability and low impacts and I'll go

449
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,900
a little bit more a little bit deeper

450
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,250
into those areas to kind of see will to

451
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,330
kind of show you what what is possible

452
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,980
there to do if you take high probability

453
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:25,030
and low impact as a defender typically

454
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:27,100
means noise means a lot of noise and the

455
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,300
thing is in defense see what you want to

456
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,830
do is you want to reduce the noise in

457
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:34,330
your environment and there's many

458
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:38,260
sources of many sources of noise now

459
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:41,830
we're low quality threat intelligence

460
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:44,470
scams fishing but also the internet the

461
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,699
media a lot of information out there is

462
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:50,350
unreliable if you if you if you

463
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,900
leak your defense if you like you'll

464
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,780
defendant be led by that information you

465
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,460
spend up chasing a lot of a lot of dead

466
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:02,080
ends now

467
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,140
let me let me share some a couple of

468
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,580
examples of how to reduce the noise with

469
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,950
you that we've done with it within

470
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,409
Google now I have to take take you back

471
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,780
a couple of years when when Mac when we

472
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,190
were using Mac OS but the platform

473
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,020
itself didn't have much enterprise

474
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:22,630
security controls yet and that virus it

475
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,389
blocked some threats didn't block other

476
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,070
threats block some threats partially if

477
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,620
so did wasn't entirely it was not

478
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,990
sufficient for our for our needs which

479
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,550
cost a lot of reinstallation xandrie

480
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,230
installations are costly to a business

481
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:38,080
especially especially if you have

482
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,690
software engineers that that that that

483
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,610
you kind of solver engineers that that

484
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,570
are four to four to eight hours

485
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:48,550
non-productive so we we looked at we

486
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,610
looked at the other options like what

487
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,260
options will be half binary whitelisting

488
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,939
was very effective on other platforms so

489
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,270
why why didn't we have a binary

490
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,850
whitelisting solution for Mac the TLDR

491
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,830
was there was none it didn't exist

492
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,909
now the advantage of working for a large

493
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,050
tech company is that you have resources

494
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,090
you can spend on building these things

495
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,770
yourself so if you're a smaller company

496
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,439
you might you might need to account you

497
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,440
might need to get a developer or team up

498
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,490
with other companies to get to get this

499
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,900
but this was one of the reasons that

500
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,790
Google developed Center in 2014 which is

501
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,260
now open source if you if you were if

502
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,360
you have a large matically than you want

503
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,420
to apply is and it basically stops

504
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,659
stopped the whole problem of of adware

505
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:38,050
on Mac but SSO as with so many security

506
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,400
controls there is a catch it was so

507
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,540
effective that it also stopped the

508
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,160
binaries from users to do the work so

509
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:48,100
kind of a problem there so one side

510
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,230
stopped the adware the other side stop

511
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,320
stop users from doing their work and

512
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,660
this is why why we reintroduced upvote

513
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,689
and for those of you not familiar with a

514
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:01,410
fault it was it was open source in 2018

515
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,000
but it introduced the concept

516
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,580
it introduced the concept of social

517
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,710
voting so the problem with with most

518
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,789
binary whitelisting solution is the

519
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,360
whitelist you have to maintain a

520
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:14,520
whitelist a lot of whitelist and an

521
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,979
organ in a foreign organization the

522
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,960
scale of Google it's complex managing

523
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,320
exceptions is a complex and costly

524
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,900
across the operations so how how do you

525
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,149
manage exceptions especially exceptions

526
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,600
that are small-scale in a more effective

527
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:33,330
way what a broad introduced is social

528
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:39,658
voting which allows which allows users

529
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:42,570
to vote for allowing a binary to run on

530
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,549
their system but this is a local policy

531
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,220
so let's say you have five users that

532
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:49,950
want to run the run binary on their

533
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,360
system and that binary is malware those

534
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,240
five systems might be getting infected

535
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,889
but it it means that the global fleet

536
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,809
does not is not affected by it and it

537
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,929
also means that there was no no

538
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:02,668
additional costs of someone that had to

539
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:06,000
make changes in the global in the global

540
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:08,460
whitelist this adds a bit more noise

541
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,880
back into this system at the trade-off

542
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,710
of preventing a lot of costs on

543
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,690
maintaining on having them maintain a

544
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:18,360
global a global whitelist and let alone

545
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:21,059
all the frustrations about users having

546
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:28,530
to apply for exceptions within within a

547
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:31,289
large organization in the end this despo

548
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:34,678
solution stopped us having to mass

549
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:37,770
reimage a lot of machines the number of

550
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,350
reimage iziz is down to a manageable to

551
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,760
a manageable number

552
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:45,090
another element of a very hard problem

553
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,340
to deal with is phishing and when I talk

554
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:50,668
with peers in order and other companies

555
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,678
what what two of the top three issues

556
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,659
that they typically deal with is one is

557
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,880
Microsoft Office document and malicious

558
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,539
ones and the second one is typically

559
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,950
phishing now phishing is a large it's a

560
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:04,679
larger complex problem than I'm here

561
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,620
presenting here but I wanted to kind of

562
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,960
share two to two different strategies we

563
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,959
have applied over the years for

564
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,150
particular user credential fishing

565
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,450
fishes are persistence even the ones

566
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:23,470
that are more opportunistic that are

567
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,940
less thought let's target it and what

568
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,140
you could do what we've done with

569
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,490
password alert is we warn users about

570
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,590
the fact that they gate just gave away

571
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,600
their core credentials because why why

572
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,129
why should the user use the corporate

573
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,469
dentures on anything else but court

574
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,850
resources now this might be good to get

575
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,580
a bit more challenging if you have a lot

576
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,949
of third-party Corp resources but still

577
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,460
you might want to consider not using the

578
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,179
same credentials for your Corp

579
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,710
environments as for those third-party

580
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:55,840
solutions and the advantage of password

581
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,870
alert is that you can you can centrally

582
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,789
collect these these alerts so you could

583
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,678
measure how effective your and our

584
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:05,770
fishing training is you could measure is

585
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,539
how how many users which departments are

586
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,850
actually the ones that are most

587
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:11,559
vulnerable to fishing and maybe focus

588
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,620
your attempts there instead of focusing

589
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:19,030
an organization-wide phishing awareness

590
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:21,459
program but in 2017 what we notice is

591
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:24,250
that even though even though password is

592
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,530
very effective in in making users aware

593
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:29,010
of being fished is that the fishes

594
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,629
themselves were getting getting more

595
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,190
getting more persistent that they're

596
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,500
also starting to fish second factor

597
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,940
token-based token-based Corp credentials

598
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:44,020
and this and this was a this was a

599
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,809
larger risk to the company one one way

600
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,240
we solve this is is we we prevent it

601
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:52,149
basically uses from entering the second

602
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,750
factor by hand so security we introduce

603
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:58,000
the security token that provides the

604
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:01,210
second factor directly into the system

605
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,820
this means that if that the Fisher no

606
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,010
longer is able to intercept the second

607
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,270
factor therefore they even they get if

608
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,490
they even get the username and password

609
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:12,280
they still haven't got the second factor

610
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,530
which which were Google limit eliminated

611
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,139
most of the credential based fishing for

612
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:20,049
for their work for work accounts as I

613
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,570
said phishing is a larger problem this

614
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:25,980
is this is just a small small part of

615
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,980
the problem scope

616
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:32,470
another element in in defense that is

617
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:35,169
that isn't to use in time impactful one

618
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,840
our false alarms and you might be

619
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:41,500
familiar with the fable the boy cried

620
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,928
quite move is that false alarms

621
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,409
typically end up in disastrous results

622
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:52,450
and I want to kind of highlight a recent

623
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:55,450
a recent recent I would say for me a

624
00:25:52,450 --> 00:26:00,159
boycott quite bull situation so what was

625
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:03,549
this nist NVD has had raided a Colonel

626
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,110
Bach as high critical basically they

627
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:08,379
were saying this is a remote code

628
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:10,899
execution in the Linux kernel this was

629
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,929
copied by a lot of companies on the

630
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:17,110
internet very very quickly very blindly

631
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:19,419
with no one verified it luckily Souza

632
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,939
was one of the few that actually said

633
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:25,360
like wait what's going on and and

634
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:29,049
pointed correctly out that that NIST did

635
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,199
misclassify misclassified their their

636
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:35,379
assessment of this digging a little bit

637
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,130
deeper into the CV and CVS process it's

638
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,510
it's not that weird that this happened

639
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,500
apparently there's very little due

640
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:46,210
diligence or quality controls applied by

641
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:50,470
the organization that is providing in

642
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:52,750
CVS they they blindly assume the

643
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,789
reporter is correct for logic companies

644
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,960
like Microsoft which have their own like

645
00:26:54,789 --> 00:27:00,220
assessments or larger open source open

646
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,330
source projects like Apache that have

647
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,980
their own kind of do their own

648
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,199
assessment as well this is less of a

649
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,330
risk because they have built they they

650
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,799
take care of those quality controls but

651
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:12,908
apparently for the Linux kernel in this

652
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:15,520
particular case it was not also CVS

653
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:22,750
whores are based on worst case

654
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:25,840
assumptions they NIST assumes the worst

655
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:28,299
in calculating now for your own

656
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,830
environment as the organization there

657
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:33,340
might be a lot more different factors

658
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:36,370
that that your impact assessments or ion

659
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,159
then just to see the CVS scores here and

660
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,709
I'll go I'll go into a couple of

661
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,559
a couple of considerations a little bit

662
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:46,280
further and apparently and this I think

663
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:51,899
this is for me the most the most

664
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:54,660
shocking element for for false alarms is

665
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,370
that there's a lot of organizations they

666
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:00,630
are out there that don't check their

667
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:03,809
information we assume an authority like

668
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,730
NIST is correct which for a defender is

669
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,120
problematic because now all hands on

670
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,830
deck

671
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:13,949
just because someone made them made a

672
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:16,379
wrong assumption so for me it's

673
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:20,250
informative from a defense perspective a

674
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,590
lot of a lot of the issues I see that

675
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:26,100
are false alarms I classify a cyber

676
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:28,860
drama these are the internet telling

677
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,350
things telling things they are but not

678
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,809
necessarily being a reflection of all

679
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,149
the details a lot of this has to do with

680
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:38,220
low quality vulnerability reports so if

681
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:42,059
you're if you are the vulnerability

682
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,530
researcher please make sure form of for

683
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,059
me as a defender perspective make sure

684
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,129
there are high quality

685
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:50,220
make sure you did do your assessments

686
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,070
make sure you did you clearly indicate

687
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,299
what what the potential impact is often

688
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,649
it also has to do with with

689
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,580
misunderstood hardware and software

690
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:01,710
behavior especially in in detection a

691
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:05,158
lot of alerts are just based side

692
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:08,250
effects of normal behavior because but

693
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:15,690
the behavior was not very clear or very

694
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:18,210
edge case these distinct service now you

695
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,470
can do a lot of organization controls to

696
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,000
solve this I mean especially for

697
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,610
vulnerabilities make sure you make sure

698
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,860
you understand your execs are aware of

699
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,360
this make sure because they said those

700
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,370
are typically the four ones to ask first

701
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,080
and say like hey yeah how are we put

702
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,510
I'll be safe how is the business

703
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,280
impacted by this vulnerability so the

704
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,150
best best way to do is to talk with them

705
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,100
beforehand

706
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,169
say like what information do you need at

707
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,120
what time when there's a large

708
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:45,360
announcement on the internet about about

709
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,729
a security control failing but there is

710
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,010
also a technical way to approach this

711
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:51,570
and me as a security engineer and

712
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,770
working for tech company

713
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,760
technical approaches are typically

714
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:59,100
preferred because they scale and one of

715
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,110
this is defense-in-depth and I'm not

716
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:04,169
sure how many people are aware of the

717
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,979
room of defense in depth but in essence

718
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,220
is pretty simple

719
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,960
it's you you make sure that you have

720
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,240
multiple layers of security controls and

721
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,640
if one fails you have another layer that

722
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,130
they take care of it takes care of it so

723
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,890
in case of your vulnerability the kernel

724
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:23,490
the kernel mode sorry the remote kernel

725
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:25,650
root exploit may be remote connects port

726
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,110
maybe not the best example but take it

727
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,230
take a burner ability in the library if

728
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,909
you have a security sandbox available

729
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,560
the vulnerability is suddenly less of an

730
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,870
issue you might have a remote code exact

731
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,990
in the library with the sandbox take

732
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,250
care of most of the exploitation

733
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:43,380
exploitation parrot if you're long if

734
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:46,050
you are able to detect that someone is

735
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,090
trying to exploit it you have it you

736
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,830
have you have a fairly fairly bit of

737
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,429
additional security cost of controls in

738
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,840
place so you can actually take care of

739
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:57,510
properly assessing the vulnerability

740
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,459
instead of making rush decisions and

741
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:03,390
maybe maybe bringing down your

742
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,520
production as well nao-san boxing is

743
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,320
complex I don't know how many people in

744
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,210
the room might have tried to sandbox

745
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,970
process before but if you're dealing

746
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:16,200
with with code that that uses a Python

747
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:18,300
stack a C++ may be other languages Sam

748
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,290
boxing is complex and this is one of the

749
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:27,600
reasons Google kind of released released

750
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:30,030
ASAP is sandbox APR to help sandbox just

751
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,679
individual components if you if you're

752
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,350
dealing with third-party proprietary

753
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,040
libraries it might be this might be a

754
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:39,750
solution to to sandbox those if you if

755
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,659
you if you don't know what the source is

756
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,720
or if you don't control if you don't

757
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,490
control what's in there I think one of

758
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,310
the more important points points for me

759
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,540
is is about the boy who cried wolf is

760
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,090
that a lot of these false alerts

761
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,790
actually fatigue or fatigue oh

762
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,889
responders they fatigue people good

763
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,139
people leave because they are either

764
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,370
burned out or they get bored out just by

765
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,529
the poor information

766
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:12,989
that they are provided with provided on

767
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:14,669
a daily basis now this this is something

768
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:18,900
closer to my heart because I said like

769
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:20,190
my background is information it's

770
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,159
instant response and take it off

771
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:26,039
forensics now it's probably also one of

772
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,840
the more harder areas to to scale and be

773
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,360
to do to do continuous improvements

774
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:36,899
because you're always in always in a

775
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:38,850
constant state of panic you're most of

776
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:41,610
the cases you do it they're high time

777
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,110
pressure the high visibility so your

778
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:47,639
execs are continuously asking for

779
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:49,949
updates there might be regulatory time

780
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,140
limits like a 72-hour breach

781
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:55,200
notifications and there's a small mark a

782
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,570
small margin of of mistake but I still

783
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,570
want to kind of take you through the to

784
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:02,129
the process that where we have been

785
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:05,010
partially be able to do within Google

786
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,500
but also partially without so I go back

787
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,379
to 2005 when I when I started doing

788
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,460
digital forensics as a consultant and

789
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:16,110
like the lessons I learned pretty

790
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:19,080
quickly is that nothing works it's hard

791
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:20,939
to automate and you really have to do a

792
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,408
lot of work to get to the data and and

793
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,059
that's what you spend most of the time

794
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:27,149
you spend most of the time recovering to

795
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:34,020
the recovering data because your

796
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:35,699
customers are not capturing that as

797
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,770
there's things you can do there's things

798
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,929
you can put in place a centralized

799
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,770
logging is a very simple way of of

800
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:45,750
getting some of the data but the game

801
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:49,559
changes when your organization is

802
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:51,690
certainly large like in more indicators

803
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,809
I was used to before I joined Google was

804
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:57,149
I went to a customer made a physical

805
00:33:54,809 --> 00:34:01,110
copy of the disk maybe the copy of my

806
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:04,289
network data and investigated it in the

807
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:06,360
lab of line when you're dealing with an

808
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:09,540
organization across many spending many

809
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,149
locations many time zones you have to

810
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,230
think about this differently and this

811
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:14,139
could also benefit in smaller

812
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,380
organization

813
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:19,750
I start collecting your logs centrally

814
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,640
think about how to get information life

815
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:25,330
without having have having to take the

816
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:27,400
time for a full disk image or maybe

817
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,699
better yet even preserve our data

818
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:34,000
automatically before and after the time

819
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:38,830
of suspicious events and track

820
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,780
historical changes the thing I think

821
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:44,110
that we were able to build within within

822
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:47,230
Google and as open-source as well is

823
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:49,780
girl and girl was kind of a at the time

824
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,210
a game changer in the way of how we

825
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,850
approached how we approach live analysis

826
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,040
it's basically an agent that supports

827
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,900
live analysis of multiple platforms and

828
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,110
allows for quick triage

829
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,900
so this this reduced the time of us

830
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:07,510
needing to get access to a machine maybe

831
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:11,230
run our live script maybe get a disc

832
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,540
shipped wait wait two months to the

833
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,610
analysis you get the idea

834
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,920
Gerber's a gorilla's a significant time

835
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,440
saver now I wouldn't say that girls just

836
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,750
looking for everyone because I will go

837
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,010
into this a little bit later is that if

838
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,120
you build such systems you have to

839
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,620
maintain them as well

840
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,970
and your organization needs to be ready

841
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:33,420
for that as well but using a different

842
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:37,750
approach than you did before

843
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:41,860
within Incident Response helps to

844
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:44,020
quickly change the process as you can

845
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:47,110
see here we added more components over

846
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:51,610
time because live analysis was not the

847
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:53,650
only solution we've got we got a we got

848
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,870
a corporate cloud and suddenly we needed

849
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,260
to make sure we're also able to copy our

850
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,380
clouds

851
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:03,430
calcium's sometimes we still needed to

852
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:05,880
make forensically sound copies of disks

853
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:10,870
so we also needed a way to remotely

854
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,700
remotely image image discs but one of

855
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:15,670
the lessons I think I wanted to share

856
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,470
today is that you can speed up you can

857
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:22,150
speed up your instant response by

858
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:23,649
putting a lot of sorry

859
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,920
putting a putting responsive

860
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:32,890
capabilities in place beforehand before

861
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:35,950
you need them now collection is fine but

862
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,839
what did I do it is data I mean like an

863
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:41,799
one side I need to quickly analysis and

864
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,019
analyze them as well as I said before

865
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:46,180
the success of the life response agent

866
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:49,328
was that heavy we are suddenly able to

867
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,970
get the data much quicker but now now

868
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:53,349
processing was a challenge and if you

869
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:56,049
look at if you look at traditional

870
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:59,140
digital forensics tools they are not

871
00:36:56,049 --> 00:37:01,420
necessarily the tools that are best

872
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,118
built with security in mind a lot of

873
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:07,119
them assume that they run in a lab

874
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,940
environment a lot of them assume that

875
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,380
they're dealing with semi trusted data

876
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,150
do you want to have a live agent with

877
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,500
root with root access or system and

878
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:19,150
administrative access on your on your

879
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:21,910
system that parses parses data random

880
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:27,220
arbitrary data with some of these

881
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:29,140
parcels probably not so this kind of if

882
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,299
you look at the early days of girl you

883
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,359
see that we're fighting we're fighting

884
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:37,180
back and forth in conceptual is like how

885
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:40,328
to best deal with this but over time

886
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:42,069
over time this this is settled in the

887
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:45,250
fact is that we offloaded the processing

888
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:47,680
to to another tool called lock to the

889
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:50,980
timeline and and this is very this tool

890
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,180
is very focused on on-time lining and

891
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,640
super time lining if you're not familiar

892
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,470
with that concept either because you

893
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,150
don't have a forensic background is it

894
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:02,649
basically a chronological overview of of

895
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:04,779
of relevant time values on a system and

896
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,970
this this this has been an ongoing

897
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:10,869
process for quite a quite a long time as

898
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:14,859
I said before when I was in consultancy

899
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:16,480
it's like to get out of the out of the

900
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,250
tool itself in this particular end case

901
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,789
and and and their poor time lining

902
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:23,259
capabilities we wrote a small what a

903
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:25,089
small library to use of interact with

904
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:28,869
other tools others build other builds

905
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:30,730
upon that in overtime someone someone

906
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:33,250
named Kristin Gilda Hansen wrote lot to

907
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:35,160
timeline and we started adding expanding

908
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:39,069
expanding more capabilities to death

909
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,810
over time but it's resulted in a vast

910
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:44,759
amount

911
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:47,549
data now the more data you collect the

912
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,530
more data you you process the more data

913
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,470
you have to analyze and this is not

914
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,390
always the most effective in an instant

915
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,709
response situation because you don't

916
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:58,230
want to wait you don't want to wait

917
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:00,660
hours or days for a full system process

918
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:02,640
you need to be selective in what you in

919
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,370
what you what you collect and what you

920
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,250
what you process one way of doing this

921
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:09,690
is if it's you could try to speed up the

922
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,790
speed of your processing another way of

923
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,490
doing is you you selectively collect

924
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:17,100
what you need but you also want to have

925
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:19,950
the full timeline if you in case you

926
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,020
need to really kind of go back Forli

927
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:24,990
understand what is happening and this is

928
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,880
why why as you can see here we started

929
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,200
building and experimenting with with

930
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,780
different tools and different techniques

931
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:33,120
like data science there are science

932
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:38,160
techniques to actually find needles in

933
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:42,299
haystacks automatically you can imagine

934
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,759
this that this tool chain over time is

935
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:49,290
can be pretty powerful it can help you

936
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:53,490
it can help you automate address analyze

937
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:56,610
doing things without necessarily having

938
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,839
to do them manually and this is kind of

939
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,460
the last lesson I want to get in a

940
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,400
giveaway is that if you think if you

941
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,530
think about turning a lot of your manual

942
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,600
work and to continue the automated

943
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,700
processes there's suddenly easier to

944
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,310
test as well there's suddenly easier to

945
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,830
control as well because they're

946
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:16,529
continuous you can test them you can

947
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:21,120
automate them you can extend them and

948
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:24,360
this means you can spend your time on on

949
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,520
improving your defenses even further now

950
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,310
one word of caution about open source is

951
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:32,700
that having having worked at having

952
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:34,710
maintained this is that a lot of people

953
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,899
assume open source does the thing you

954
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,570
want out of the box but it is rarely the

955
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,360
case you have to be ready to invest time

956
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,190
into it and you have to be ready to to

957
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,140
adopt it to your own needs

958
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:49,110
this also means you have to understand

959
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,730
your needs you have to be able to

960
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,800
communicate your needs necessary to do

961
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:55,360
the project maintainers

962
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,360
because your needs might not be the same

963
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,130
as their originally needs and if you

964
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,470
really rely on software in cases of

965
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,810
incident management well you you you

966
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:09,250
might want to have support on sighs in

967
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:12,400
case of a fire it's kind of roughly

968
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:18,850
recap I only kind of addressed the top

969
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:23,560
of the iceberg here what are ways you

970
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:27,600
could you could improve the security of

971
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:33,400
your defenses now what one way is is is

972
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:36,910
approach it proactively turn manual work

973
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:40,990
into continuous automated processes keep

974
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:43,720
the noise and manual burden low don't

975
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:46,180
fatigue your people with low quality and

976
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,230
poor poor quality information keep

977
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:53,770
testing keep evaluating your defenses

978
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:55,570
and what loss one lost code if you're if

979
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,460
you're interested in pushing the

980
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:00,180
boundaries of information security we're

981
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:03,600
always looking for for good people

982
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,600
any questions

983
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:16,410
[Applause]

984
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,790
hello okay now to imagine to a lot of

985
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,129
people who are working in the trenches

986
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:23,400
in InfoSec you know this is a bit like

987
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,560
science fiction well these are problems

988
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,420
with our max getting hosed let's just

989
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,730
create a whitelist software and assign a

990
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,990
bunch of people to write it it's always

991
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:35,700
good to see what's happening in the

992
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:37,500
future but I do wonder one thing that

993
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,990
came through right and just before I I

994
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,230
want to ask my own question

995
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:45,419
rich mogul was a security analyst

996
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,790
turned startup guy he's been in the

997
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,280
industry for decades and he coined a

998
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,930
term recently that I thought really

999
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,099
helped me to think differently about a

1000
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,810
lot of this sort of stuff and a lot of

1001
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,090
this sort of tooling and he turned that

1002
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:59,430
blue collar slash white collar security

1003
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:01,050
tools and it seems like the blue collar

1004
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:03,419
tools the ones that actually just get

1005
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,099
 done are the most valuable I just

1006
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,660
wondered what your take on that is

1007
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,530
because it seems like you're really

1008
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,910
quite a proponent of just these you know

1009
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,099
these things that can take away a lot of

1010
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:16,859
the a lot of the load that are quite

1011
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:18,510
simple things so so I'm not a proponent

1012
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,580
of it I actually actually think a lot of

1013
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:23,070
like a lot of the work I started in the

1014
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,750
early days in forensics is those kind of

1015
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:28,320
tools they're like tools to get the work

1016
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:29,450
done the thing is the thing is if you

1017
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,510
keep using the tools

1018
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:35,520
you cannot extend beyond those tools but

1019
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,470
once once you're able to kind of glue

1020
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,540
these tools together you can do even

1021
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,359
more and that is kind of more the

1022
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,910
message like use the blue color tools

1023
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:47,520
you get those tools in preferably in

1024
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:50,609
reusable components you can you can glue

1025
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,680
together use those components to further

1026
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:54,060
build build the system and for the

1027
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,950
people here who might be working for

1028
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,720
more traditional enterprise I mean I'd

1029
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,580
imagine that's kind of result in you

1030
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,689
know gluing together various commercial

1031
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,950
tools I mean is that something that

1032
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:05,010
you've looked at I imagine you would

1033
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:06,210
have a fairly decent insight into some

1034
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,500
of the commercial tooling or is it

1035
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,619
really just the case that because you

1036
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,180
google you build your own so so so I

1037
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:14,099
mean there's definitely a tendency to

1038
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,598
build our own because just just the

1039
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:17,010
diversity of the environment it's it's a

1040
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,960
non-traditional it's a non-traditional

1041
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:21,660
IT environment so

1042
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,599
a lot of like the commercial available

1043
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:27,180
solutions don't do necessary work I know

1044
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,550
I know it specially for forensics there

1045
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,618
are organizations working on this but

1046
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,569
there's also presentations of the

1047
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:35,280
vendors themselves to glue those things

1048
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:37,740
together because that means suddenly

1049
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,440
they cannot long no longer lock you into

1050
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,479
their into their product so it really

1051
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,390
depends I mean you could use you could

1052
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,710
you could hire a server if you're like a

1053
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,118
more traditional environment could hire

1054
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,369
a software developer that can help you

1055
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,050
glue these things together you could if

1056
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:53,520
you have good relationships with with a

1057
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,119
vendor and some events are pretty open

1058
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,130
to it

1059
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,650
you could even work with them to get

1060
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,599
these things together you have to kind

1061
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:02,550
of think outside of the traditional box

1062
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:04,589
here is that I have a tool and this is

1063
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,450
the only capabilities I have within my

1064
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,950
tool instead of checking through the

1065
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,419
checklist think about everything to work

1066
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,410
together now we do have a question here

1067
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,410
gentleman in the blue jacket

1068
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,740
but in

1069
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:22,270
you have a little bit coming from

1070
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:25,890
conference and presenting it you have

1071
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:25,890
like Constitution areas deal with

1072
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,830
[Music]

1073
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:36,280
so the question was really like you know

1074
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:37,900
whether or not yo Kim here's a you know

1075
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,340
is really trying to evangelize this

1076
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,930
position and encourage other people to

1077
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:44,020
do it or if he's just speaking about

1078
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:45,669
what Google does I would say it's more

1079
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:48,670
it's more is more a large part I mean

1080
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:52,270
that we see at least talking with kind

1081
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:54,310
of tech companies or a tech companies we

1082
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:56,980
see similar we see them going into

1083
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:58,960
similar directions but what I said from

1084
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,480
the beginning I mean like I don't expect

1085
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,580
a bank or a financial institute to adopt

1086
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,740
the same principles like I don't think I

1087
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,450
think a lot of the continuous

1088
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,549
improvements are very specific to the

1089
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,680
organization I think you can I think an

1090
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,850
organization like a bank can do it but

1091
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,759
it's gonna be different it's gonna be

1092
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:18,220
different I think if there's if there's

1093
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,140
room to share approaches if there's room

1094
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,819
to go like hey there's open source

1095
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,279
solution that can do this X for you and

1096
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:27,490
if you adopt it in such a way well you

1097
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,710
have outsourced open sourced Santa and

1098
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:31,750
and things like that I think one really

1099
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:33,640
good example for Google is you know

1100
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,960
beyond Corp where you've you know

1101
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,879
externalize that and people are like

1102
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,560
great that's science fiction but then

1103
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,330
other companies have sort of run with it

1104
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,910
like duo have run with their whole

1105
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,529
beyond Corp for the rest of us so yeah

1106
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:47,430
other questions we got one over here

1107
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,430
from Brett more

1108
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:51,950
[Laughter]

1109
00:46:53,490 --> 00:47:00,390
the Smythe's on petition the detective

1110
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:03,820
work on business to debate that did not

1111
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:06,390
voice the words will take on health much

1112
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:08,620
[Music]

1113
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,750
for those who haven't heard yeah it's

1114
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,759
like asking about the risks of

1115
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,830
oversharing like techniques for

1116
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,360
detection and stuff we are you worried

1117
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:18,370
that by sharing these people will have a

1118
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,080
better shot at by passing your detection

1119
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:22,120
so you have to always you have to always

1120
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,299
be ticketing in mind that you see the

1121
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:27,069
same as threat intelligence death that

1122
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:30,130
some most of the times these information

1123
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:31,150
is shared in close and close groups so

1124
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,500
you have to be careful about what you

1125
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:37,630
share but but also like a lot of the

1126
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,490
time the attackers don't care especially

1127
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,930
with the automated attackers they have

1128
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,240
to hijack your resources they're there

1129
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:45,009
to hijack they collect the accounts sell

1130
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,629
them they don't care about if you're

1131
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:55,450
using a very Wireless thing or not they

1132
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:57,250
don't care about it just they so it

1133
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:00,399
depends I mean like if you if you have a

1134
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,070
if you have a very targeted attacker you

1135
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,780
might not want to share that information

1136
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:07,690
but a lot a lot of the attackers are are

1137
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,280
not that targeted and those are the ones

1138
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,260
that are actually causing for the former

1139
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,630
defender perspective most of the

1140
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:18,720
headaches so why not share those

1141
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:23,310
techniques question down here

1142
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:26,790
yes it really so much about using stuff

1143
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:29,430
like the right way we're using Excel

1144
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:31,440
information to get a better response to

1145
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:34,879
the concert attack as you get to your

1146
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,880
end to the bulk of the attackers

1147
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:45,869
some of the much Peola using the tool in

1148
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,869
if you have it replace the trying to

1149
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:51,950
prevent down

1150
00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:55,369
jin-yi potentially the kind of technique

1151
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:55,368
haven't perfect

1152
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,029
so I mean you want to repeat the

1153
00:49:00,109 --> 00:49:03,710
question well I mean I I'm trying to

1154
00:49:02,029 --> 00:49:11,119
sort of unpack that question a bit as

1155
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:13,190
well you might have tech might have

1156
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,289
checked to me is an ontology that tries

1157
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:17,119
to describe different types of attack so

1158
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:20,510
if you if you want to use it in your

1159
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,890
organization say like hey I'm giving

1160
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:24,829
this attack this label because it's

1161
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:26,450
important important me why not wear a

1162
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:28,400
real risk of mitre attack being diluted

1163
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:31,118
by every single vendor or like putting

1164
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,490
little check marks all over their matrix

1165
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,220
now the question we need to go back does

1166
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,779
that answer your question or look I'm

1167
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,609
trying to gonna understand you guys can

1168
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:46,150
pick this one up after all right who's

1169
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:46,150
who's next we got one right here sorry

1170
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:57,169
very services

1171
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,270
robots which are you know why for the

1172
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:02,960
company that have contextual knowledge

1173
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:07,440
all the company's assets they don't have

1174
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:10,630
the skillset for instance

1175
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,590
those guys seem to be the guys that I

1176
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,590
did we

1177
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,830
and this security maturity and marijuana

1178
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,000
has been brought to the point where

1179
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:22,119
lighting

1180
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,530
[Music]

1181
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:29,450
little I'm doing tool development these

1182
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:33,590
guys have to make a decision as to

1183
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:38,379
whether they engage by

1184
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:38,380
it's all saved will draw down there

1185
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:44,800
it's false

1186
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:48,680
is there anything that you can give us

1187
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:54,200
to make that decision as to whether

1188
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:55,368
business more informed decision so the

1189
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,020
question for people who didn't hear it

1190
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:58,340
is like this is science fiction to a lot

1191
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,230
of people in this room how do the rest

1192
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,410
of us deal with the people who don't

1193
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:08,510
have like for I are ninjas on staff

1194
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:10,640
writing software I mean I mean could you

1195
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:13,900
work together with a software company to

1196
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,900
maybe get some of this in place

1197
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,280
so I think I think there are but I mean

1198
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,330
it's gonna be it's gonna be difficult so

1199
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,200
I should just say the question because a

1200
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,880
lot of people wouldn't have heard that

1201
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,960
it's like at what point you know how do

1202
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,540
you make the decision to actually engage

1203
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,940
say an external forensics you know

1204
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,590
consultant or something at what point do

1205
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,790
you pull the trigger on that as an

1206
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:00,190
organization that doesn't have one on

1207
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:01,359
staff I mean me you probably are able to

1208
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,280
already capture this in an

1209
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,480
organizational security control you

1210
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,369
already have come maybe a checklist

1211
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,500
where you can say like hey think about

1212
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:10,210
these things and make a decision of our

1213
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,130
death if you work able to capture it in

1214
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,990
a checklist you're able to script this

1215
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,130
to some to some extent and that's

1216
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:17,410
already the first step of your

1217
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,119
continuous order into integration you

1218
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:21,430
can reevaluate that that checklist and

1219
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,859
say like okay is that our new cases that

1220
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:25,720
we haven't thought about so start small

1221
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:27,040
there and like and don't don't limit

1222
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,660
yourself to kind of just you need

1223
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,380
software to do this a lot of this can be

1224
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:33,848
done organizational controls as well

1225
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:36,580
hopefully that answers kind of because

1226
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:37,570
you get any more questions one more down

1227
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,869
the back and then I think we're going to

1228
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,869
wrap it up

1229
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:55,549
so you're talking about sharing with

1230
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,079
inside yeah so Google being a massive

1231
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:58,579
organization for those who didn't hear

1232
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:00,470
you know how do you then go about

1233
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:02,210
sharing you know internally generated

1234
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,680
threat intelligence with the rest of

1235
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:07,460
Google is that something you even do I

1236
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,839
mean I mean but in yes certain

1237
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,539
information is shared across the company

1238
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:13,819
but like I already indicated a different

1239
00:53:11,539 --> 00:53:15,799
party organization have different needs

1240
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:18,049
for different types of threat

1241
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:19,490
information so it doesn't make sense to

1242
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:23,480
put everything in a large reports it

1243
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:25,848
makes more sense to have the teams that

1244
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:28,549
need the information get that in an

1245
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:29,960
efficient way from the team that deals

1246
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:31,460
with generating information there are

1247
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,049
companies that make information sharing

1248
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,940
platforms just for that that are

1249
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:37,220
hideously complicated but that some

1250
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,839
people actually need you know I did a I

1251
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,640
did a sponsored thing for one of the

1252
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:42,529
companies that that make that stuff and

1253
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,240
it's yeah when you're dealing at that

1254
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:46,250
sort of scale like trying to figure out

1255
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,549
where you know what goes where is just

1256
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:52,039
it's quite difficult but especially

1257
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:54,230
there I would say be pragmatic I mean

1258
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:57,859
most of the value is in actually in a

1259
00:53:54,230 --> 00:54:00,529
pragmatic solution and less in by taking

1260
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:03,140
the deployment of such a platform to to

1261
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:05,270
correctly put put the information in

1262
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,160
whatever ontology that is used across

1263
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:10,250
the company like having information

1264
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:12,410
available is probably the most in an

1265
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,390
easy way to get it's probably the most

1266
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,799
the most effective the most beneficial

1267
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:19,129
part of what's the practical way to do

1268
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:21,440
that like a wiki wiki a web service that

1269
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:23,869
web servers that allows you to query the

1270
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,900
information is relevant to your to your

1271
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:28,970
part of the organization

1272
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,970
at least I can I help you miss

1273
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,470
you
