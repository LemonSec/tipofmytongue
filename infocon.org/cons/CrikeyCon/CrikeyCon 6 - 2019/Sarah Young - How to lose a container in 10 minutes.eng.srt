advocate called Tania Juncker I do have

40
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,149
her permission to steal this I know

41
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,039
she's been on risky biz so but they

42
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,710
already gave the game away and cuz you

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,979
know it's not a big it's not a big

44
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:09,560
surprise with my t-shirt either I work

45
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,239
for this small software technology

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,720
company you might have heard of them I

47
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,610
don't know again the problem I I should

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,129
have told you Pat not to say who I work

49
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:23,959
for but because it was this slide anyway

50
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:25,079
yeah I am a security architect I'm based

51
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,660
in Melbourne

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,170
they actually say that I pay rent in

53
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,609
Melbourne because I'm never there

54
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,119
practically after this I'm going to

55
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,320
Japan which is cool of course but yeah I

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,080
don't spend a lot of time at home I'm

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,920
the best flatmate because I'm never

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,410
there but I pay half the rent my job is

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,079
helping customers move their stuff into

60
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,600
the cloud securely and advising them how

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,120
we can do that now also I talked about

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,680
how specifically Microsoft and Azure

63
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,210
does that I'm not doing that today of

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,740
course because that this would not be

65
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,000
appropriate for a community event I

66
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,590
worked in tact for last decade or so I

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,390
originally from the UK which you can

68
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,440
probably tell by the accent I used to

69
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,179
live in New Zealand for quite a long

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,090
time and then last year I came to

71
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,760
Australia I overuse alot of memes and

72
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,980
gifts or gifs whatever you want to call

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,940
them we're not going there and in my

74
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,220
presentations so yeah and this is

75
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,890
actually my job title which is Azure

76
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,620
cloud security and compliance global

77
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,510
black belt and like you think I'm joking

78
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,489
but I'm not this is genuinely my job

79
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,350
title I didn't know it was my job title

80
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,209
until I started at Microsoft when

81
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,890
everyone was referring to me as a gbb

82
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,040
and I had to ask someone what it meant

83
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,899
because I had no idea you can basically

84
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,630
replace that word global black belt with

85
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,550
specialist but at least you know I can

86
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,130
kind of tell people I fight hackers and

87
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,019
stuff I don't I've actually not an

88
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,430
incident response or anything but you

89
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:59,790
know it sounds pretty cool right I don't

90
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,580
know yes we'll go with it yes it does it

91
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:06,329
kind of borderlines on kind of a little

92
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,610
bit I'm trying we've talked about family

93
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,670
friendly words and now I can't think of

94
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,080
one hour again I was definitely trying

95
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,299
to think of a family friendly word that

96
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,890
it borderlines an arrogant and cool I

97
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,269
don't have it on my business cards

98
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,219
either she just have specialists but

99
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:25,650
officially that's my job title so yeah

100
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:28,050
and in the similar vein to what our

101
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,570
previous talk and I have a super common

102
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,930
first and last name and if you google me

103
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,580
you will see other seryeong's and my dad

104
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,350
told me and if it had been anyone apart

105
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,969
from my dad who told me this this was

106
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,619
only last week he was like do you

107
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:43,259
if you google you you come up on the

108
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:45,179
first page now and I was like dad okay

109
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,949
kind of weird well it's not weird cuz

110
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:48,479
it's my dad but if it had been anyone

111
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:49,919
else it would have been weird but you

112
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,589
also have seryeong the Christian author

113
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,619
see I found her book in this was in CVS

114
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:58,259
in Hawaii last year but her book was

115
00:04:55,619 --> 00:05:00,389
like $30 so I wasn't gonna buy it and

116
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,149
one that I can't put up a slide of it is

117
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,309
seryeong the late-1980s porn star it's a

118
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:08,369
real thing so google that with caution

119
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:10,379
because it is a thing I found it when I

120
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:13,289
was 14 at school so that doesn't say

121
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,879
much for my work my school's filtering

122
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,659
we were all doing the put our name in

123
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,059
comm and seeing what comes up and yeah

124
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:24,539
and no one no one got what I got that

125
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:26,639
was for sure so um so there you go so

126
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:28,169
actually the seryeong Condamine has

127
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,579
actually gone up for sale recently and i

128
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:33,419
really want to buy it but it's like 500

129
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,889
bucks but yeah so i think i probably

130
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,139
wasted about five minutes just talking

131
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,399
about random things a lot of the time

132
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,779
I've done this talk when I was

133
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,099
international and usually I have some

134
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,199
slides about how everything in Australia

135
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:44,639
is trying to kill you because people

136
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,079
seem really obsessed with out overseas

137
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,329
but we're in Brisbane so I don't need to

138
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,969
I think I got those slides from this bit

139
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:53,759
so what are we going to talk about so as

140
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:55,139
you saw my amazing movie poster you

141
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,550
don't need to know anything about that

142
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,649
movie if you haven't seen it by the way

143
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,599
for this talk but if you don't know the

144
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:03,029
premise of that movie it's basically

145
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:05,069
that Kate Hudson decides that she's

146
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,009
she's a journalist and she's going to

147
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:10,259
make all the common mistakes that women

148
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,319
make during datings and what we won't go

149
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,849
there into how kind of vaguely

150
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,569
stereotypical and possibly dodgy that

151
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:19,979
kind of whole concept is but and then

152
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:22,019
she tries to see if she can drive

153
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,029
Matthew McConaughey I can't remember the

154
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,860
names and the natural movie she sees

155
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:29,069
sees if she can get rid of him in ten

156
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,829
days so I was thinking about containers

157
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:33,869
and how they get owned a lot or people

158
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:35,639
don't do them particularly well that's

159
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:37,289
what hey maybe I could do an experiment

160
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,509
where I could see if I could get a

161
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,849
container owned in ten minutes

162
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,799
now when I submitted this talk to the

163
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,719
CFP I was still kind of in the middle of

164
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:47,429
this experiment and I had this great

165
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:49,769
idea that I would spin up a container

166
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:51,789
just before the talk and we check it at

167
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:53,830
the end and we'd see that

168
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,930
been totally owned now I wouldn't wasn't

169
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,340
gonna give out the like details of it

170
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,390
because I realize like if I give out the

171
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,580
details of something at a hacker

172
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,830
conference clearly by the end of my talk

173
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,650
it's gonna be owned like that seemed

174
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,300
like slightly unfair no that didn't work

175
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,330
amazingly well but we'll come back to

176
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,520
that so that probably in itself isn't a

177
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,620
presentation that's probably about ten

178
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,270
minutes worth of ranting so I'm going to

179
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,610
talk about good security practices for

180
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,890
containers kubernetes and related tools

181
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,080
I'm also going to talk a lot about cloud

182
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:26,140
migration and like I said I'm cloud

183
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:30,159
agnostic today which is cool ignore the

184
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,570
back of my t-shirt and we're going to

185
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,400
talk about good security practices for

186
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,140
containers Cuban Eddie's and other

187
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,780
related things I'll talk about cloud

188
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,640
because usually when someone is moving

189
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,989
to the cloud and container right they're

190
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,659
container izing their apps at the same

191
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,690
time they often go hand-in-hand I have

192
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,850
seen one whole business that decided

193
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,310
they would containerize on pram I don't

194
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,920
really know why you'd bother but I

195
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:56,200
accept that is the thing possibly so I

196
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,450
split this into a couple of bits which

197
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,930
is protecting your data caring for your

198
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,219
OS and orchestrators checking privilege

199
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,000
shifting left of containers and getting

200
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,130
my containers pwned I do add as I said

201
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,590
before a lot of gifts and random

202
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,150
pictures in you know what if I can't

203
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,750
find anything suitable I just default to

204
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:20,950
cat so you know I like it it's a cat the

205
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:24,850
container come on if I fit so sits you

206
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,380
know yeah anyway so and this pretty much

207
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,570
sums up container and Cuban Eddie's

208
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,030
security for me and it's not monkey

209
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,610
emoji specifically it's monkey see no

210
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,860
evil hear no evil speak no evil one of

211
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,479
the big problems that I find when people

212
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,039
want to containerize their apps is they

213
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,760
just think hey and we'll just split it

214
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,380
up dump it in the cloud done and as far

215
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,200
as security goes well whatever we were

216
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,180
doing on a traditional application stack

217
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,240
we can just keep doing that no problem

218
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:56,199
and it'd all be fine anyone come across

219
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,050
that attitude yes

220
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,760
I'll good hands up some hands up I like

221
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,349
to like get people to put hands up like

222
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,810
I'm not publicly shaming people I

223
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,610
promise and so good data

224
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,170
action practices though this is one cool

225
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,430
thing about me moving to Microsoft is

226
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,040
that I get to use all the little bit

227
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,050
racoon stuff in my presentations which I

228
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,709
wasn't actually they are open source a

229
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:20,050
lot of them but yeah so in the words of

230
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,640
Mary Poppins and I know it's not Mary

231
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,709
Poppins who actually originally said

232
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,540
this so someone pointed this out to me

233
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:29,290
once after a talk I dunno I just don't

234
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,949
actually I can't find out who it is well

235
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:35,140
we're gonna is half done so when like if

236
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,720
you this is something that is not new to

237
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,730
anyone in security but if you lift off

238
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,640
an application and the application is

239
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,800
rubbish and you put it in the cloud even

240
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,779
if you containerize it it's still

241
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,490
rubbish at least at the application

242
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:50,560
level as you can see I'm trying to

243
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,260
carefully pick my words to make this

244
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,050
family friendly and I sound so British

245
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,080
being like it's rubbish oh it's not very

246
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,240
good like I said I want to default to

247
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,550
other words but I'm trying to be good so

248
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,490
you don't bleep me and so if you move

249
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,410
into the cloud like you should be and I

250
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,000
if you're a developer you should be

251
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,219
doing this and if you're a security

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,950
person you should be encouraging your

253
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,650
developers to do this actually tidy it

254
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,350
up like use TLS 1.2 or even better use

255
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,240
1.3 nothing should be being sent in the

256
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,880
clear if you've got some kind of weird

257
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,620
funky deprecated protocols and okay you

258
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,120
may have to set up some kind of tunnel I

259
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,820
don't know that's horrible but do it

260
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,400
make sure everything's encrypted tidy up

261
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,790
code in other words simplify the whole

262
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,470
thing now I know the you will get people

263
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,849
saying well this isn't part of the scope

264
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,580
of this work we're just doing a

265
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,820
migration but I asked you if you're not

266
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,200
doing it now when are you gonna do it or

267
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,709
are you just gonna check it on the risk

268
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,920
register for later okay like everyone

269
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:55,780
knows that happens but yeah okay what

270
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm saying here isn't container specific

271
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,490
but this is I think it's still very very

272
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,930
relevant because you know it doesn't

273
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,440
matter if you move something into the

274
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,569
cloud you know probably Google Amazon

275
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,860
Microsoft whoever like let's face it we

276
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,600
can probably do data centers a lot

277
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,040
better than you can but if your

278
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,900
application is still rubbish on top

279
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,480
though those layers of the stack is

280
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,269
still rubbish right so yeah

281
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,800
and me talking about that brings us

282
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,889
nicely on to the shared responsibility

283
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,839
model when you put things in cloud you

284
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,670
need to understand this has anyone heard

285
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,779
any cloud provider it doesn't matter

286
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,110
which one talk about shared

287
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:35,510
responsibility model a few people

288
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,889
possibly not enough well everyone calls

289
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,319
it the same thing as far as I'm aware

290
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:42,970
and this is understanding which bits of

291
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,709
the which bits of the cloud you are

292
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,630
responsible for now and I stole this

293
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,189
little graphic as you can see it's

294
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,130
blatantly been cut from a different

295
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,199
slide from one of my colleagues but I

296
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,500
think it's a pretty good descriptive

297
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:59,329
description so um SAS that's like a

298
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,190
hotel room essentially you just bring

299
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:03,620
yourself along and check in nice

300
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,949
everything's done for you it's tidied up

301
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,810
every day did something just fall down

302
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:12,290
yeah I just saw that little corner of my

303
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,119
eye platform-as-a-service it's more like

304
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,579
a furnished apartment so you know you

305
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,560
bring all your own stuff still a largely

306
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:20,599
done for you but maybe the cleaning is

307
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,449
done like once a day and not what's

308
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,100
today sorry once a week and with eius

309
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:27,050
it's more like a rental apartment so you

310
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,880
get the room but you need to sort

311
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,800
everything else out in there so you need

312
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,620
to furnish it you need to look after it

313
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,149
and you need to clean it private cloud

314
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,490
is essentially like owning your own home

315
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,899
you buy it and then you've got to build

316
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,459
it you've got to do the maintenance for

317
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,290
the outside of the building the inside

318
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:45,500
etc you know it's all your

319
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,029
responsibility yeah it's it's really

320
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,430
important you understand this because a

321
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,350
lot of cloud problems come from not

322
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,469
understanding where that responsibility

323
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,069
lies and I've had multiple discussions

324
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,870
and my current role and previous roles

325
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:03,050
about just you know who does what

326
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,339
because often misunderstandings with

327
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,430
that you know things fall through the

328
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:09,370
gaps it happens a lot because we're

329
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,469
moving away from that traditional

330
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:16,819
security model castles this is a good

331
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,589
castle so I like castles I could say has

332
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:20,420
everyone used this analogy like the

333
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:25,490
traditional security model has a castle

334
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,839
with big walls and a moat etc yes we'd

335
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,339
like it that was a good picture of a

336
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,570
castle I should have put a Japanese one

337
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:33,020
on actually Singh isn't good

338
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,850
soon birth anyway it's also important to

339
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,140
understand isolation and how we're

340
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,780
moving away from this traditional

341
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,910
security model so instead of doing the

342
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,449
big big enforce perimeter we're going

343
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:46,579
towards zero trust and this was as we

344
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,140
all know Google Beyond Corp is probably

345
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,970
the most famous implementation of this

346
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,110
but you should be doing this throughout

347
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,040
your cloud so we're doing

348
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,840
defense-in-depth

349
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,130
which we've already which we've already

350
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,660
had talked about so I'm not going to

351
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,240
explain difference in depth because it's

352
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,740
multiple layers of Defense but the idea

353
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,830
is that even if someone breached some of

354
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,170
your cloud hopefully and there will be

355
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,970
controls within your actual internal

356
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,160
environment that will stop them moving

357
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,880
laterally or or at least make it more

358
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,040
difficult so I wanted to do a quote

359
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,470
about isolation I'm pretty sure Jimmy

360
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,930
Page wasn't talking about the cloud but

361
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,660
it was quite a good quote because it

362
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,339
said security and isolation should make

363
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,130
you feel very secure you should be doing

364
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:32,660
isolation I'm like a per endpoint per

365
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:34,310
instance per whatever level you can tell

366
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,230
it like I've been so used to doing like

367
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,209
small customer presentations and my

368
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,070
default at the end of a section is to be

369
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,200
like just that make sense anyone have

370
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,810
any questions like we can wait to the

371
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,780
end but I've spent too long doing that

372
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:51,530
recently so I'm caring for your OS and

373
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:53,439
your Orchestrator now I've been using

374
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,439
Cuban Eddie's an Orchestrator kind of

375
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,870
interchangeably in in this talk so far I

376
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,930
acknowledge that the reason for that is

377
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,260
I do think that Cuban it is in my

378
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,930
personal non-employer opinion is going

379
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,080
to become the sort of de facto

380
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,569
Orchestrator

381
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,880
I know there are others out there and I

382
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,800
have different runts about those if you

383
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,240
want to come and ask me afterwards so

384
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,699
I'm going to talk a lot about Cuban

385
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,830
Eddie's but you know quite a bit of this

386
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,590
can be applied to any old Orchestrator

387
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,200
is anybody not using if anyone's using

388
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,480
orchestrators or who has had experience

389
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:33,430
with orchestrators are you using

390
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:39,880
anything apart from cuban Eddie's okay

391
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:42,920
any ranchers or Rancher person cool

392
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,980
but mostly cuban at ease yeah I thought

393
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,990
so I went to Cuba in Seattle in December

394
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,700
and it's like 8,000 people is huge it

395
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,010
went up from something like a thousand

396
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,500
the year before it's it's totally a

397
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,150
thing sort of way um if there's one

398
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,680
thing you need to do one thing you need

399
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,360
to do when you talk when we're doing

400
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,729
container security this is what I tell

401
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,950
everyone to do which is make sure you

402
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,930
know where your container images come

403
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,370
from because we know there are so many

404
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,469
repos on the internet there's the

405
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,660
official docker Wan and then there's

406
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,970
loads of random stuff on github and get

407
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,060
lab and it doesn't matter doesn't matter

408
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,070
what it is um make sure that in an

409
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,540
enterprise environment you're pulling

410
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,310
these container images and then you're

411
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,170
storing them in an image repository and

412
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,640
when there's not in the image repository

413
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,160
they've been scanned they've been

414
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,920
checked you've had all your enterprise

415
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,810
tools whatever you use put on them don't

416
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,689
let devs just randomly pull from the

417
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:39,800
internet um I know that's easier said

418
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,380
than done I know but please try and make

419
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,969
it easy for them to do it this way

420
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,189
because then you make sure your images

421
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,440
are consistent all the big cloud

422
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,570
providers have image repositories and

423
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,490
there's plenty of open source and other

424
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,800
third-party tools you can choose from

425
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,660
this Claire there's no tree I think no

426
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,740
tree just got bought by someone and has

427
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,680
become something else

428
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,150
so can't remember now but because you

429
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,040
know if you've got a compromised image

430
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,359
and this is the same with anything you

431
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,099
know it's game over already it doesn't

432
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,448
matter what controls we put on top

433
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:12,230
because you know it's like sneak attack

434
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:16,000
I know I know

435
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:19,930
I just leave it there for a minute for

436
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,609
someone told me I'm I did this talk in a

437
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:26,060
meet-up in Melbourne and a lady told me

438
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:28,159
that she didn't like this gift because

439
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,980
she found it upsetting and then I felt

440
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,050
really guilty so my caveat is like I

441
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,420
hope no one finds that upsetting I just

442
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,419
find it funny because I don't think the

443
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,550
kid will have been badly hurt but I mean

444
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:45,800
I think they just fell over but if if

445
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:47,870
anyone doesn't like that I'm sorry so at

446
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,430
the fault in default like I wanted to

447
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,860
put that The Fault in Our Stars which is

448
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,140
a really weepy teeny movie but it didn't

449
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,000
really seem to fit um

450
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,920
kibbeh no these default config aren't

451
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,330
really secure now they are getting a lot

452
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,800
better they just released version 1.14

453
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,810
last week or the week before I forget

454
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,280
very recently and you really need to

455
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,530
work through Orchestrator conflicts to

456
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,090
secure them and some notable bodies

457
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,740
depending on the kubernetes version

458
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,990
you're using is that the API server

459
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,550
listens on port 8080 there's no kind of

460
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,050
checking or authentication and it'll

461
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,770
just take pretty much anything you throw

462
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:23,080
at it which is kind of terrible and

463
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:27,100
secrets manage kubernetes secrets

464
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:30,790
management restored a net CD and encoded

465
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:34,780
in base64 that was until about three

466
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:37,149
versions ago so excuse me if you're not

467
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,740
using the most recent the most recent

468
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,660
version or two of Cuban Eddie's like

469
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,600
please make sure you're not using that

470
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,190
default and sis the int Center for

471
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,350
Internet Security have released a Cuban

472
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,230
a benchmark it's free it's really easy

473
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:53,409
to use please work through that please

474
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,480
and you know to if you're not two up on

475
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,870
kubernetes and it's only been around for

476
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,570
like since 2014 and like I said I was at

477
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,860
Q Khan in Seattle in December and there

478
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,360
were a load of the Google engineers

479
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,280
there who've been involved in it since

480
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,959
the word go and even they're saying like

481
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,700
we don't understand it all anymore

482
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,680
there's just way too much stuff going on

483
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,160
no one can possibly know everything

484
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,260
about it so you know there's no shame if

485
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,330
you didn't you know either yourself or

486
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,920
your engineers or your development teams

487
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,139
don't really understand this yet because

488
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,000
you know it's reasonable and first time

489
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,980
I ever did this talk was in Seattle so I

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,380
put Fraser in even though I know Fraser

491
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,980
wasn't actually filmed in Seattle but I

492
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,370
do love him so yeah and if your result

493
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:39,490
of found it's a secret to everybody I

494
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:42,580
know revealing my age don't bake creds

495
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:46,570
and secrets into containers anyone seen

496
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,490
this happen I mean it's almost as bad as

497
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,230
just like it's it's like the new and

498
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,910
it's the modern-day equivalent of just

499
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,670
having config files with hard-coded

500
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,170
creds in right don't bake resin secrets

501
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,720
into containers they should be passed in

502
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:01,630
as variables as I said Cuban Eddie's

503
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,180
will store secrets a net CD encoded in

504
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,410
base64 unless you're on the last couple

505
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:12,350
of most recent versions I love

506
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:14,540
it's one of my favs yeah everyone loves

507
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,639
this it's it I mean it's really old now

508
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,290
but I refuse I mean I think this one's

509
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,820
nearly a year old but I refuse to take

510
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,909
it out of my presentation because it's

511
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,500
like too good again you should be using

512
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,450
some kind of secrets management whatever

513
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,790
cloud you're using everyone provides

514
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,740
their own secrets management and the

515
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,930
third-party tools I always recommend

516
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:36,050
just using can't native tools if you can

517
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:40,010
usually just for ease of use now I have

518
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,899
seen a couple of use cases where the in

519
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,730
the cloud inbuilt secrets management

520
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,340
isn't suitable and if that's the case

521
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,860
then you utilize third-party secrets

522
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,530
management but don't do it unless you

523
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,840
have to is my advice and we don't talk

524
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,570
about this enough I almost give it its

525
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,820
own slide because like I said we don't

526
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,820
talk about this enough rotate keys

527
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,889
regularly if you're in the cloud I'm not

528
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:06,710
gonna tell you how regularly that's an

529
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,540
awful risk management type decision it

530
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,490
is really but if you've got really

531
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,409
sensitive data you should be rotating

532
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,240
your keys regularly and even if it's not

533
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,980
so sensitive you should probably be

534
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,020
doing it at least every six months once

535
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,940
a year now of course I know that's a

536
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,190
pain to do and you should be automating

537
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,230
it I'm not saying do it manually but we

538
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,330
don't talk enough about how that should

539
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,570
be being done it's it's just common

540
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,490
sense maybe that's why we overlook it

541
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,939
anyway moving on to my Horror Story

542
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,880
number one now it's hard all my horror

543
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,020
stories I have three they are vague and

544
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:46,130
that's because I can't identify

545
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:49,270
the companies involved plus I it is

546
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,620
actually pre my current employer and

547
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,660
yeah I'm just not allowed to do that but

548
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,550
they are real I did see this happen

549
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,560
so dev he needed a slight different

550
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,730
image with different libraries etc he

551
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,950
was just like I'll square I'll pull it

552
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,880
from a public repository so we know what

553
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,090
happens next

554
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,190
any guesses or if anyone's actually seen

555
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:13,879
my talk online possibly you'll already

556
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:17,590
know the answer yes Bitcoin miner I know

557
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:21,490
I like I like the yeah

558
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,730
I like the gifts so much okay so check

559
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,950
your priveledge we're not talking about

560
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,870
sort of white people cuz that's what it

561
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,640
seems too but I just I just like the

562
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,629
whole check your priveledge and it's

563
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,300
actually cool because we talk about

564
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,490
privilege so much so and check your

565
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,790
privilege for containers like don't

566
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,560
Rinna's we don't - we don't really like

567
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,970
we know this year we've been going on

568
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,889
about not running his route for a really

569
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,860
long time and now I know there are a

570
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:50,770
couple of scenarios where you do need to

571
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,629
run a route like genuinely um like if

572
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,150
the container needs to modify the host

573
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,560
system but if that's the case then B you

574
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,860
should be using runtime security tools

575
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,850
to limit what successor accessible so

576
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,620
there are lots of different things you

577
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,750
can use but some honorable mentions go

578
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,239
to a chrome faucet that one you have to

579
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,820
pay for SELinux which has been around a

580
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,030
long time but it's an oldie but a goodie

581
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,919
I have Palmer and SATCOM profiles now a

582
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,260
Palmer's a little bit better because it

583
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,120
actually is namespace aware as well if

584
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,530
you know stuff about kubernetes we also

585
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,979
recommend you put things into different

586
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:26,410
namespaces SELinux has got a rap for

587
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,580
being really really difficult to use but

588
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,650
if you haven't used it for the last

589
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,659
three or four years I would say go give

590
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,840
it another go because it's got a lot

591
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,010
easier to use just by default so yeah

592
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,720
give it a go

593
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:42,129
couldn't think of any pictures to put up

594
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,890
here so great rhymes with root so yeah I

595
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:48,670
know literally my sense of humor is like

596
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,470
top notch and it's this one's even worse

597
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,180
to be fair because I just put cliff here

598
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,300
on it because cliff he deserves to be in

599
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:57,670
more things and I didn't have a better

600
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,050
picture to put up um as I said before

601
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,310
I've kind of gone over this it's a

602
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,260
little bit of repetition of what I was

603
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:04,659
saying before given at ease has some

604
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:07,270
terrible defaults especially the older

605
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,190
versions so anonymous user access wasn't

606
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,290
didn't used to be disabled the - pin

607
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,900
board had full admin privileges by

608
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,909
default prior to version 1.7 and it had

609
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,340
no are back before version one point

610
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,920
eight so if anyone is still using these

611
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,830
really early versions please make sure

612
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,330
you fix this and just upgrade actually

613
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:28,600
now I'm just telling people to upgrade

614
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,580
but a really important point I want to

615
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,860
make here is that if this

616
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,029
to owners to go through because you

617
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,830
still don't have the skills and

618
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:38,860
kubernetes because it's still really new

619
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,080
go and look at using a managed cluster I

620
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,309
don't care whose cluster you gonna use I

621
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,658
didn't care if it's Amazon or Microsoft

622
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:49,570
or Google or whoever but take that

623
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:52,929
responsibility away like you know why

624
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,970
not there's no shame in doing that I do

625
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,440
think sometimes it can be like a point

626
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,690
of pride for people to be like nope

627
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,399
we're gonna build our own we need to do

628
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,409
it you know we need to do it ourselves

629
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,239
but there's a lot of stuff to go through

630
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:06,820
you have a look at the Kuban and assist

631
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,350
benchmark right there is a lot of stuff

632
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,668
to work through there and if you don't

633
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,100
have the resources and you don't have

634
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,870
the time seriously consider taking some

635
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,370
of that responsibility away and letting

636
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,750
someone else deal with it for you and

637
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,939
there are also some interesting

638
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,450
open-source tools around that will do

639
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:24,429
some scanning on your cluster as well

640
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,500
they seem to be more AWS focus than

641
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:29,470
anything else so you probably need to be

642
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:33,909
using AWS but yeah give it a go but

643
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:35,110
don't be too proud to say hey I I you

644
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:36,340
know don't be too proud to say hey do

645
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,990
you know what let's use the manage queue

646
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,639
bananas cluster at least to begin with

647
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:43,960
it's easy do it do it

648
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:46,299
so Horror Story number two

649
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,220
someone this was a test environment

650
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:50,500
cubed a DS cluster spun up a test

651
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,120
environment and it was left with all

652
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,519
this defaults and it was left exposed to

653
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,239
the Internet for that half day and you

654
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,240
guess what happened

655
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:05,979
it could minor I know like it's not the

656
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:08,559
only thing that can happen but it seems

657
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,559
to be it is the kind of easy attack du

658
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,480
jour as Bitcoin mining so luckily it was

659
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:17,049
picked up relatively quickly and so did

660
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:20,399
not so much harm but yeah last but not

661
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:23,168
least in my tips and good practices is

662
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:26,739
containing your enthusiasm for shifting

663
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:28,179
left so don't assume that your tool set

664
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,649
and this is what I was saying right at

665
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:31,720
the beginning don't assume your tool set

666
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:33,789
is adequate for your needs when your

667
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,159
container izing things usually your

668
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:39,639
security tool set will minimum need

669
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,470
extra agents adding or will need to be

670
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,600
reconfigured and it may be that you need

671
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,900
to go from scratch and buy something new

672
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,959
that's

673
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,810
actually container aware and when I talk

674
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,970
about security to tools I'm talking

675
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,310
things like your IDs your vulnerability

676
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:57,220
scanning whatever kind of seam you use

677
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:59,110
if you have one if you use run time

678
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,330
security again you may need to review

679
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,699
that and if you've got any auditing

680
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:05,050
tools as well because you there's no

681
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,910
guarantee that they will work

682
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,580
they probably minimum will need some

683
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,800
tweaking and same goes for your CI CD

684
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,389
pipeline now if you're just moving to

685
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,030
the cloud it's likely you probably

686
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,160
didn't have a CI CD pipeline so you're

687
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,260
probably going from scratch anyway but

688
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,700
if you do happen to have one then you'll

689
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,680
probably need to alter your tools and

690
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,740
some tools might need to just go

691
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,260
entirely but you really need to do your

692
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,510
research I can't stress this enough like

693
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,190
I don't care if you have like a

694
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,570
licensing agreement for the next ten

695
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,070
years with someone I know some

696
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,720
commercial people might care about that

697
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,100
but it's all well and good having a

698
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,490
licensing agreement that goes to ten

699
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,669
years but if the tool can't see anything

700
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,300
what's the point right because what we

701
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,800
want to do is benchmark tools like

702
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:53,230
seriously go and benchmark tools like I

703
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,600
know that people just usually put in

704
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,700
Google and go okay what works let's get

705
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,889
these sales people in to talk to us but

706
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,930
like really going benchmark things make

707
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,910
sure you do a proof of concept make sure

708
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,380
you actually look at them and you should

709
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,950
be doing this with you devs as well

710
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,960
because we've probably all seen security

711
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,120
pick at all they're like yeah this tool

712
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,120
is fine we love it but then devs of like

713
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,649
can't use it anyone seen that happen yes

714
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,989
because we want devs and security to be

715
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:26,950
like this I know I know

716
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:32,200
I really like Pokemon I'm 31

717
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:33,910
yeah and but it's so much more valuable

718
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,800
when you actually do a joint thing and

719
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,660
whether we like it or not we're moving

720
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,100
towards dev sock ops and DevOps like

721
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,230
we're all working closely together and

722
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,270
there's way more overlap so you really

723
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,560
need to find something that's going to

724
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,810
work for everyone otherwise there's

725
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,179
literally no point and last but not

726
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,210
least Horror Story number three I saw an

727
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,560
organization who they were using

728
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:55,090
old-school vulnerability scanners and

729
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,950
they actually weren't an old-school

730
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,590
product they just needed tweaking and

731
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,270
they hunt done it

732
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:02,330
and they were like on your environment

733
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:05,120
is completely secure there are no

734
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:09,230
vulnerabilities in it and I was like mmm

735
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,760
yeah so I have like I was like no but

736
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,440
actually replaced this recently with

737
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,629
this because I feel that was a better

738
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,029
Trump well you know Trump in the

739
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:22,760
McDonald's in the federal shutdown but

740
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:26,630
yeah cool fail I know he thought it was

741
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:29,419
good but whatever cool and then last but

742
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:32,870
not least this was my experiment which

743
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:34,880
was getting myself toned so what I've

744
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:37,489
been doing is spinning up containers

745
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,470
kubernetes clusters other things and

746
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,799
leaving them open to the Internet well

747
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:46,870
now I got six months it was not on the

748
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,830
cloud platform of my current employer

749
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,439
because I have to take someone here

750
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,149
would you use PayPal so I could just put

751
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,490
an amount down and not have to attach my

752
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:56,570
credit card do it so I tried to do

753
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,460
basically the opposite of everything

754
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,990
I've just encourage you to do because

755
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,860
you know I wanted to say forget the

756
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,419
hackers I really love that I can't

757
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,299
believe it's taken me like a year right

758
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:10,159
and talks to find that it's gonna go in

759
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:13,940
like every single talk ever right from

760
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,350
now on I think anyway yeah I didn't I

761
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,529
wasn't brave enough to do this on any

762
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:20,029
infrastructure of my own cuz no and you

763
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:23,419
know I wanted these things to be

764
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:25,760
compromised and anyone got some ideas

765
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:27,230
about like what type of containers might

766
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,000
be particularly vulnerable to getting

767
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:32,799
owned if I spun them up and like just

768
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,270
left them open to the Internet sorry

769
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,889
yeah yeah but like anything in

770
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:41,000
particular this brings to mind is like

771
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:46,090
particularly attractive maybe a manga DB

772
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,909
yes yes would obviously WordPress yeah

773
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:52,340
so my favorite ones were a bun to 1404

774
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:54,559
and WordPress I did do some other things

775
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,658
I had a MongoDB and other things but I

776
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,799
was like there is no way these can set

777
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:02,240
up on the internet for long without

778
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:05,090
getting owned no way unfortunately like

779
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,370
okay so apparently getting things owned

780
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:08,870
when you're trying to do it is like

781
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,489
harder than one would think

782
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,449
now I don't know if some people were

783
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,149
like this is blend

784
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,039
honey pots not touching this but I

785
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:18,529
didn't I mean I even left a wordpress

786
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:21,799
container open that you could set it up

787
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:24,080
I did one with admin admin unlike or I'd

788
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:26,899
admit it so easy oh my god

789
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,928
like nobody owned any of my stuff

790
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:31,969
majorly I got some weird scans and and

791
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,450
that was about it but this made me feel

792
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,149
better

793
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,799
so Atticus if you don't know Atticus she

794
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:38,689
is an amazing public speaker she works

795
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,970
for sure and she's based in Melbourne if

796
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,070
you ever get the seat chance to see her

797
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:46,909
speak I highly recommend going to see

798
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:48,889
her she's far better than me and she

799
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:50,750
tweeted that it took a month before the

800
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:53,178
WordPress site she set up actually had a

801
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:56,600
proper attack which made me feel much

802
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:59,210
better much better well interestingly as

803
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,010
well it's I have to just one comment

804
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,450
it's really fun to try and reverse

805
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,570
engineer something on a cloud platform

806
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,460
to actually make it vulnerable like so I

807
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:09,889
was going through the web stuff like

808
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,720
open everything open everything blah

809
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:13,959
blah blah blah blah and I think it's

810
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,399
likely that there was of course some

811
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,380
inbuilt platform protection that I don't

812
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,600
have any control over that may have been

813
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,580
protecting those containers as well who

814
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,959
knows but anyway I just wouldn't say

815
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,408
it's actually quite fun to go and

816
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,720
reverse-engineer things um quickly I'll

817
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:33,080
tell you and one of the funny things I

818
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,460
did find though was um looking at I was

819
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,769
using a tool called it's either called

820
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,419
peer Sadie or peace out I'm not sure how

821
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:41,570
you say it basically it's kind of like a

822
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:44,899
bit of a an IDs type thing that runs on

823
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:47,240
the IP tables and Linux and it does look

824
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:48,830
ups for the whatever scanning you and it

825
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,149
shows you things and one of the most

826
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,980
interesting things I found about this

827
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:54,459
whole thing was how apparently people

828
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:57,350
use who is lookups for advertising like

829
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,419
okay like we are not an ISP and

830
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,219
especially crafted and optimized for

831
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:03,950
bandwidth hungry applications well

832
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,960
there's like our hackers dream and take

833
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,830
advantage of the best deal of bandwidth

834
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,809
on the Internet

835
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:13,070
and of course my all-time favorite from

836
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:14,960
China security trouble like I don't know

837
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,928
like that's genuinely what it came out

838
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,990
as who knows I know this is a very basic

839
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,590
experiment but it was good fun and I

840
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,860
don't know

841
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,280
I said maybe someone was so small that I

842
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,969
can

843
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:30,889
even tell they've owned my staff I just

844
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,470
wanted a Bitcoin miner for god sake like

845
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,870
I would have been happy but um in

846
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,370
conclusion so tell your application

847
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,979
before you move to the cloud

848
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,840
I'm containerize an Orchestrator

849
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,730
defaults are terrible so please change

850
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,770
them if you don't if you're not

851
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,410
confident changing them consider using

852
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:51,139
something managed and please please

853
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:54,320
please please make sure you know where

854
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,970
your container images come from don't

855
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,870
run as root Oh

856
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:02,600
I share very good reasons for doing so

857
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:06,820
keep your secrets secret don't put them

858
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,319
in CD encoded in base64 please God and

859
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,759
if you're shifting laughs doing the

860
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,530
DevOps thing because let's face it

861
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,419
that's what management every want

862
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,460
everyone to do no because it sounds good

863
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:18,770
make sure you've got the right tools to

864
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,750
support this and apparently this is

865
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,960
literally like my last slide and I

866
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,639
really need to rearrange these slides

867
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,380
perfectly to get containers hatches

868
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,449
apparently harder than one would expect

869
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,480
or maybe I'm just really bad at running

870
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:35,418
experiments I don't know um it's the

871
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,830
good old useful links site but the

872
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:38,179
siskiyou Bonetti security benchmark

873
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:41,710
there's the cyst doctor security

874
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,710
benchmark nist special publication

875
00:34:52,570 --> 00:35:06,680
800-53 a book late last year about

876
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:08,660
kubernetes security and how to how to

877
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,930
secure it it's pretty new and you can

878
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,790
get like a free PDF of it online cause

879
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:16,009
Microsoft have some security concepts

880
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,870
for Cuban Nettie's but it's very general

881
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,250
and if you ignore the algae bit at the

882
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,049
end it's basically applicable to

883
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,970
everything and that tool that I was

884
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,970
using which is pretty fun to have a play

885
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,230
around with PS ad or piece odd it's open

886
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:33,290
source it's done by a chap called

887
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:35,030
Michael rash that is me done thank you

888
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,460
very much for having me I don't know if

889
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,490
I'm way under time or I know I'm not

890
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,170
over but

891
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,149
am i doing okay I don't know all right

892
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,099
didn't ask my timer going so I can't say

893
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:53,400
but that's me done so thanks very much

894
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:55,020
for having everybody now as is my custom

895
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,619
as the emcee I get to ask the first

896
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,130
question

897
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,450
yes can you talk about knowing where

898
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,160
your container images are coming from

899
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,618
and I see things like you know docker

900
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,170
hub and stuff and I just think Android

901
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,470
App Store you know it's like a cesspit

902
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,119
of guaranteed pre-owned crap right how

903
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,589
do you even know where your stuff comes

904
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,240
from how do you know that a developer

905
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,560
account hasn't been owned and the good

906
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,060
image replaced with a bad one like the

907
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,540
supply chain problem with pre-built

908
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,779
containers is it's bad it's bad it is

909
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,859
bad and like docker Harbor even heard so

910
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:29,280
probably heard this on risky biz and

911
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:31,380
like probably did actually because the

912
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,119
docker hub even had some dodgy images on

913
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,890
it but it was downloaded what I think it

914
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,170
was something like 300,000 times before

915
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,960
they got rid of it so even the official

916
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,450
repositories are bad I mean what you

917
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,000
need to do really is pull something from

918
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,950
the most legitimate source you can find

919
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,080
and then you should be running more

920
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,339
checks over it when you before you

921
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,650
actually chuck it into your image

922
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,730
repository so so you're not at the point

923
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,470
where you're saying people should just

924
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,180
build their own there is that as well

925
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,379
you could just build your own but I

926
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,180
think the problem with building your own

927
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,220
is that not everyone's got the time and

928
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:04,020
the capability but then again I'm

929
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,660
telling people to download an image and

930
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,160
then like add your own tools so that's

931
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,950
probably maybe that's about the same

932
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,170
time investment fast easy secure pic -

933
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,839
yeah yeah it's actually yes uh-huh

934
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,960
is how it goes alrighty so let's throw

935
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,310
it out to some questions all right well

936
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,520
I got more let's just keep going with

937
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,859
that

938
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,509
Oh kubernetes you mentioned one of those

939
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,970
horrorshow kubernetes bugs and we did

940
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:28,760
cover that one and it really occurred to

941
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:31,379
us when we were discussing that that

942
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,150
kubernetes hasn't like a bug like that

943
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,980
one shouldn't show up in anything that's

944
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,990
had any sort of meaningful attention so

945
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,540
even though it was just one bug it was

946
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:42,419
of the nature that made you sort of

947
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:45,150
clench you know it was just a bit you

948
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,310
know what's your sort of feeling for

949
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,900
what we're gonna see in turbine Eddie's

950
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,930
in the future because I have a feeling

951
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,330
that's not gonna be the only

952
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:55,220
it won't be and I think because it's

953
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:57,410
still new I mean it's still changing but

954
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,240
they were saying again I keep going when

955
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,680
I was in Seattle but they were saying

956
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,689
the engineers were saying kubernetes is

957
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:05,089
starting to become boring which is a

958
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,680
good thing because that means it's

959
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,150
changing less and it's sort of starting

960
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,980
to stabilize out but it's not a hundred

961
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,630
percent there and I think because it's

962
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,420
still quite new I know now we've had the

963
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,980
worst security bug kubernetes has ever

964
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:21,680
had yes and it was a little bit

965
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:24,200
hysterical but it was like please don't

966
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,450
ever quote me saying that like at 9.8 CV

967
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,600
or whatever is not bad or hysterical

968
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:31,819
whether it was but especially when it's

969
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,589
the that runs all your other

970
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,790
you know yeah I know and the fact that

971
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:40,160
it was undetectable it's like not great

972
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:43,610
but I'd say yeah yeah it's not a great

973
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,960
bug I have to say I think though I think

974
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,150
we'll probably get a couple more of

975
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,830
those yes someone will find something

976
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,290
terrible and it'll be a bit hysterical

977
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:53,750
and then I think it I think it'll start

978
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:56,029
to like calm down a bit and it'll be

979
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,130
more kind of rather than oh my god like

980
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,840
you said like clenching it'll be more

981
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:03,080
maybe just i rolling like we do with

982
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,310
like cisco yeah yeah sorry I did I'm not

983
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,170
I'm not like off any other

984
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,730
vendors yeah the reason the reason pop

985
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:10,520
arrived hamstring poppy buffer overflow

986
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:13,190
in a password field was a favorite for

987
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,330
2019 Cisco man thank you very much for

988
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,870
that Cisco

989
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:19,759
yeah Bitcoin Bitcoin miners great low

990
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,259
impact way to learn a lesson I think I

991
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,120
mean I pretty much your best-case

992
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,680
scenario if you're gonna get is you know

993
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,180
what though I think well cuz they're

994
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,190
easy to do right and the easiest kind of

995
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,690
shovin an image on the choir or just

996
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,780
load up if you've got some kind of dodgy

997
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:34,340
you know or easy to oh it's it's a shame

998
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,820
when you're Amazon Web service billing

999
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,860
statement is performing as your IDs

1000
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,510
which is oh yeah yeah that should not be

1001
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,450
how you find out but you're right it's

1002
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,470
like a low impact minimal kind of way to

1003
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,870
learn a lesson

1004
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:50,509
yeah so in that sense I guess we have to

1005
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,890
be thankful for Bitcoin miner cuz you

1006
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,630
know that you know if the worst thing

1007
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,100
that happens is you get a big bill I

1008
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,080
think you're actually you just got off a

1009
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,759
hop pretty lightly now you're talking

1010
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,620
before about security software that

1011
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,880
developers height I'm gonna take a wild

1012
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,880
guess and say that you're talking about

1013
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,400
things like Pam

1014
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:14,250
for Linux right yeah I've just heard

1015
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:16,140
like they universally yeah I mean I

1016
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,400
don't know it can it can vary a lot

1017
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,230
though with the different tools like

1018
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,089
like security real like we love this

1019
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,430
it's great and like have you seen like

1020
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:25,529
some of the ones I forgotten the name

1021
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,819
I've forgotten the acronym now for the

1022
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:29,519
ones that literally start giving

1023
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:31,109
feedback as developers code oh I forgot

1024
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,000
I've totally forgotten the out crinum

1025
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:34,680
but it literally gives feedback as they

1026
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,509
type and I've been told this is height

1027
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,549
is it white is it like Clippy but for

1028
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:40,349
developers yeah hello it looks like

1029
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:47,519
you're trying to write a cross-site

1030
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:50,250
scripting I will put a product like

1031
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,959
suggestion in for that that'd be fun

1032
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,530
the future is horrible everyone give it

1033
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,679
up again

1034
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,679
[Applause]
