1
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,410
the amount of people using is or

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,119
nowadays II this is kind of it's pretty

3
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,140
ubiquitous right if you work for a large

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,119
enterprise there's a pretty good chance

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,020
you're using a zoo I guarantee you will

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,849
take something away from this

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,239
conversation so please make sure one

8
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:31,239
feel welcome

9
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:39,559
hi everyone thank you for having me

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:42,289
quick poll who he was currently Ewing a

11
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:46,879
Shah in some foreign art holy crap okay

12
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:50,420
more than what I thought so bit of

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,000
history previously I worked as a

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,880
penetration tester then I worked

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,560
building some infrastructure both these

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,130
were for the government for about five

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,649
years

18
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,440
and now currently I work as a senior

19
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:05,329
stock analyst for large final financial

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,320
institution doing a bit incident

21
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:10,548
response that kind of thing and as you

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,770
can tell from the title I like a good

23
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:17,720
pub rock song so I sure have a good clip

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,960
II mean without when you talk about

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,320
Microsoft right so then for this talk is

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,039
basically to introduce people to parts

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,470
of Asia give some indicators about

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,140
things to be aware of things to look out

29
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,600
for maybe a couple little hints and tips

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,460
that we've picked up along the way I'm

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,339
not really going to be covering as your

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,960
active directly simply because there's

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,600
just too much to cover there and same

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,610
with office 365 but there are a lot of

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,408
amazing talks that already cover that so

36
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,420
hopefully you still get some good stuff

37
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:54,549
out of it

38
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:59,119
so the goal we have this great beeg

39
00:01:54,549 --> 00:02:01,970
Windows 98 s cloud in the sky fill with

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,670
some fantastic services we have our own

41
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,400
on-site network filled with what we're

42
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,140
monitoring and checking and we just want

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,450
to make sure that none of the badness

44
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:14,359
that may be on our networks or maybe

45
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,379
monitoring us or maybe even remotely

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,150
trying to access us is looking able to

47
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:24,440
gain access and able to take advantage

48
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,590
of our Azure services why would you

49
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,280
maybe go with a cloud

50
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,340
well a few simple questions sir

51
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,610
redundancy regulation easy to regulate

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,260
the risk and even reduce the risk each

53
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,260
of the cloud environments themselves

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,480
have their own particular advantages

55
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,160
Asia has some fantastic features so we

56
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,890
wanted to take advantage of that in a

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,170
way and this is obviously what we want

58
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,329
to avoid we don't want to end up with

59
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,069
something even worse than what we

60
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:01,920
started with so there's a lot of edge

61
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,660
with specific terminology this is a

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,839
fantastic resource if you haven't seen

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,340
it from eventid dotnet basically give us

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,700
a comparison between all the cloud

65
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,730
providers and relation to typical

66
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,839
on-premises kind of terminology I'll

67
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,160
give you a second just to take a

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,849
screenshot if you want if you haven't

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:25,260
ready I see a camera going but I'll be

70
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,420
trying to summarize some of the more

71
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:34,260
basic terms and give a general overview

72
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:37,260
into how as your works so let's let's

73
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,620
break it up and start to break down at a

74
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,200
very high level how Asia actually works

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,790
so you have some developers there you go

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,500
hey I want to develop something I want

77
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,108
to I want to platform to build something

78
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,859
on so that my users can actually access

79
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:55,440
it and take advantage of it they need

80
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:58,109
tools to be able to access it and manage

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,139
it and deploy their code or to actually

82
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:03,180
build the infrastructure so you've got

83
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,870
three different methods which is using

84
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,609
the web GUI the portal using PowerShell

85
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,560
you can technically do all these

86
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,389
commands and career at all and there's

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,720
also a web-based command line interface

88
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:19,289
that you can use they all authenticate

89
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,800
through Microsoft graph API which also

90
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:24,690
ties into Azure Active Directory then

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,039
from that it actually cruises that as

92
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:31,260
your arm resource manager and the first

93
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,479
thing it does is checks an azure policy

94
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,810
so as your policy you can sort of think

95
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,770
of as a group policy very very important

96
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,200
plays a huge role

97
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,940
and then you can also deploy our what's

98
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,159
called an arm template which is just

99
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,790
basically a JSON representation of some

100
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,680
infrastructure or a resource you can

101
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,780
then use that to authenticate to a

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,260
subscription filled with resource groups

103
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,030
fill with resources and in those

104
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,490
resource groups you can have further

105
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,900
policy so you can basically say yes

106
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,120
they're allowed to access as your

107
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:08,020
resource manager but maybe not that as a

108
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,120
resource group of choice and then you

109
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,789
can deploy a resource and your users can

110
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,610
access it and life is good right

111
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,680
well actually what happens if the

112
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,020
policies void if someone tries to do

113
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,150
something they shouldn't this kicks off

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,640
a secondary policy called the audit

115
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,370
policy which creates an entry in the

116
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,919
event log that Event log then triggers

117
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,080
an alert which you can then get to

118
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,420
trigger an automation which is basically

119
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,140
a fancy way of saying code and you can

120
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,680
use that to deploy an arm template so a

121
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:44,500
good example of this is if someone tried

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,480
to access a resource group you could

123
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,840
technically deploy a network security

124
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,040
group or a firewall rule for Asia and

125
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,940
automatically deploy it to that resource

126
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,760
group to stop them from connecting and

127
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,219
if you've got office 365 it can also tie

128
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,890
in with the Microsoft graph API and then

129
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,980
can also leave an event in the event log

130
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:10,570
so a really valuable way of getting some

131
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:12,990
good information out there so more

132
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:16,080
terminology for you I apologize is lots

133
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,700
but our high-level you have a tenant

134
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,520
inside that you have a subscription or

135
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,760
if you've got an AWS background AWS

136
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,740
organization inside that you can have a

137
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,039
resource group or multiple resource

138
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,840
groups in source that you have inside

139
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,300
that you have a resource so this could

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,960
be a compute could be a storage could be

141
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:43,420
a path service could be SQL Server your

142
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:46,810
choice and inside of these you are free

143
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,180
to do it with what you want they connect

144
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,830
out through a virtual network or a

145
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,770
virtual private cloud

146
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,030
for the AWS people and inside that you

147
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,849
can have either multiple virtual

148
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,489
networks with multiple subnets or just a

149
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:05,889
single virtual subnet with sorry a

150
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:08,259
virtual network with a subnet now we

151
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:11,349
were looking at this and we went to

152
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,360
ourselves whole new cloud platform a

153
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:15,580
whole lot of new terminology a whole lot

154
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,530
of new things first thing we should be

155
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,770
doing is threat modeling right we want

156
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,508
to understand what can happen what

157
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,120
people are going to try and be doing and

158
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:29,560
what we can do counteract that

159
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,710
so first yeah first step for every sort

160
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,090
of new infrastructure

161
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,370
this also means looking at what

162
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,770
different parties so gonna be using your

163
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,509
infrastructure the developers who are

164
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,008
going to be deploying code as well as

165
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,280
some of the users and how they're going

166
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:47,379
to be accessing it and then we can try

167
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,440
and develop techniques to fill those

168
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:54,009
gaps or monitor and see where we go from

169
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,830
there as you can see we use the mitre

170
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,300
attack model pretty heavily used if you

171
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,039
seen yesterday's talk you obviously have

172
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,080
a bit of background in it and it's

173
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,509
pretty well known funnily enough there

174
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,120
are Microsoft and Asia have their own

175
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:09,759
developed policy called stride I which

176
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,069
stands for spoofing tampering repudiate

177
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,289
her reputation information disclosure

178
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:17,289
denial service and elevation of

179
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,628
privileges so there's no real one-to-one

180
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,878
mapping that can be done obviously that

181
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:27,250
Azure is tailored more towards their own

182
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:29,740
threat model means while there are some

183
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,389
really good things in place sometimes

184
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:38,500
you also have to make sure it's suitable

185
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:41,289
for you now this is the one thing I want

186
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:44,589
everyone to take away from this is that

187
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:47,980
identity is basically King on a jar if

188
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:51,190
you have someone else's identity you

189
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,779
basically can do anything as that user

190
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,190
and there is nothing from an azure

191
00:08:52,779 --> 00:09:02,589
perspective that can separate them from

192
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:03,870
a legitimate user and as organizations

193
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,459
mature

194
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,860
we're obviously transitioning more

195
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,810
towards an identity based model so that

196
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,360
can feel really well there if you're

197
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,508
looking to that way but if you don't

198
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,240
have that sort of level of maturity you

199
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:21,180
might have a bit of difficulties and

200
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,790
then on top of that you have multiple

201
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,439
ways to authenticate so multiple

202
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,230
identities authenticating multiple ways

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:35,459
can make it very difficult to

204
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:37,050
differentiate between keep in mind we're

205
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,199
talking purely about the management

206
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,939
interface we're talking about before we

207
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:44,849
obviously want to monitor and protect

208
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,660
people who can build change delete our

209
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,240
infrastructure but thanks to arm we have

210
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,300
a little logs especially the activity

211
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,440
logs where we can relate everything back

212
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:01,139
to an identity so we can see user X try

213
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:07,019
to build y at this date and time from

214
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:09,329
this location so coming back to the

215
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,000
mitre attack model a little bit of recon

216
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:13,739
and initial access to see what ways

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,790
people can potentially come into our

218
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,029
network hybrid accesses are quite a big

219
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,399
trajectory that I think is overlooked

220
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,620
think of how people think of how your

221
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,509
own network could already be if you're

222
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,970
in network is already compromised and

223
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:32,279
you're using hybrid access to upload

224
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,750
into the cloud then potentially you've

225
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,750
just made it easy for them and giving

226
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,029
them access as your Active Directory as

227
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,730
I've already talked about is pretty well

228
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:45,480
known to have some issues obviously it's

229
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,589
being worked on constantly so just make

230
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,589
sure that's locked down very tightly

231
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:53,810
hands up out of curiosity who's seen

232
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:55,980
onedrive phishing somewhat recently I

233
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:00,388
see quite a large proportion of the room

234
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:03,269
obviously Asia onedrive office 365 or

235
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:06,060
massive targets and with the relation

236
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:10,410
with identity obviously phishing now has

237
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:12,268
a biggest severity than before and one

238
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,910
little tip that I don't think many

239
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:17,720
people seem to realize is the public get

240
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:22,430
repos so there's actually a few files

241
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:25,670
which hard-code tokens of people's

242
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,380
identities so you find these files

243
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,620
online you do a search again you'll find

244
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,110
a ton you've instantly got service

245
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,620
accounts that people have set up susto

246
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,899
khun's for storage accounts and a bunch

247
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,139
of other stuff so easy access right

248
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:46,120
there it's not just as simple as

249
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:49,040
enabling multiple factor authentication

250
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,750
sometimes well if you're not doing it

251
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,569
you're definitely in the wrong direction

252
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,040
so definitely it would recommend it but

253
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,940
um

254
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,920
you've also got to make sure that's

255
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,010
actually being used so if you just turn

256
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,170
it on and go job done it could be that a

257
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,810
user actually hasn't gone and set up

258
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:08,300
multiple factor authentication so you

259
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,959
can still log in without having to that

260
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:14,449
second level of access so yeah

261
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:18,018
definitely keep that in mind it's a

262
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:20,959
possible attack vector right there such

263
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:24,019
tokens absolutely amazing for access as

264
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,790
well because once you authenticate you

265
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:29,569
can do everything that the the Turcan

266
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,250
has been enabled to do and this reflects

267
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:33,680
a bit of what Sarah young was seeing in

268
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,949
a talk yesterday that make sure you like

269
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,699
change your keys often because these

270
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:42,949
sass tokens they're set and if you don't

271
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:47,689
change them you pretty much have full

272
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:49,729
access still so a bit more recon initial

273
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,019
access I sort of feel like I'm building

274
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,819
on some of the talks that are being

275
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:55,490
covered already here and reflecting a

276
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:59,360
bit of what they've said so by default

277
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,860
storage accounts which are they consist

278
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,339
of four different types of data that can

279
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:08,660
be stored in their blobs tables queues

280
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:13,910
and files blobs are like a JSON dump

281
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:15,350
like use like like literally IQ so

282
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,189
really good for working between

283
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:23,180
applications files are like in SMB share

284
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:26,209
and a table is like a new SQL table so

285
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,029
they've got four different types and by

286
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,099
default they're all internet accessible

287
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:33,410
and as you can see from the URL

288
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,640
there are history to by default you can

289
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,709
obviously change that and I would

290
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,400
recommend that you can remove the

291
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:43,580
anonymous capability of them and they're

292
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,400
also pretty easy to sort of work out

293
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:49,310
whether it's a blog post or a file or

294
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:53,510
further they actually also have a

295
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,329
maximum and minimum character count for

296
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,280
the name so they have a minimum of 8

297
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,350
characters and a maximum of a 24

298
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,880
characters don't know if that's case

299
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,580
sensitive but I've definitely seen some

300
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,780
scripts which can be used to brute force

301
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,560
looking for anonymously available

302
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:11,390
containers and as was like issued and

303
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,729
talked about in one of the earlier talks

304
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,340
the continuous integration and

305
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,200
continuous development pipeline

306
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,640
absolutely critical to this but that

307
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,440
sort of comes back to what I was saying

308
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,490
earlier about if your own environments

309
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,780
are compromised

310
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,260
you're just going to be pushing

311
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:30,199
compromised code up there are three

312
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:33,350
addresses at the bottom if you've got

313
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,380
access to a VM say you've to sir

314
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:40,100
discovered someone's account through a

315
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:42,730
phishing attack they can be really

316
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,900
valuable to sneer for fraud and poker

317
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,560
they can give you some information about

318
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:51,949
the hypervisor about the machine itself

319
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:55,369
about how its configuration and in terms

320
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,950
of the last one sorry in terms of the

321
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,170
second one you can actually sinkhole it

322
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,740
and take a machine of flying or what

323
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:06,199
appears to be are flying from Asia so

324
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:10,630
these addresses are critical I'll cover

325
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:15,670
a little bit of protection that later on

326
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:18,980
so next off execution and persistence

327
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:22,219
interesting thing is - your platform is

328
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:26,410
built for executing code story encourage

329
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,450
and re executing it again right so

330
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:32,930
coming back to the CI CD development

331
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:36,440
lifecycle obviously it's not hard to

332
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,859
change some code resubmit it and now

333
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,030
you've just deployed some malicious code

334
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,100
especially for desired state

335
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:46,170
configuration codes you can indicate

336
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,420
our box should be so if you're missing

337
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,310
mimikatz from it you can say hey to play

338
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,410
it although seeing that memory cats

339
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:58,380
going to play on Windows 2016 by default

340
00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:01,380
inertia so I wouldn't suggest that when

341
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,209
you go to create an application you

342
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,939
actually have to specify a service

343
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:08,819
account principle so it's a bit like a

344
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,850
run as account so you can suggest what

345
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:13,019
account it should be running yes and it

346
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,310
doesn't actually have to be just

347
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,250
PowerShell you can actually deploy a

348
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:21,138
Python code as well so real easy way to

349
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,139
deploy some whooshes code very easily

350
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:27,599
there are some self-contained repos

351
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:30,569
within a jar so you can pick and choose

352
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,490
from legitimate sources but it doesn't

353
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:34,680
take much to adjourn so just be careful

354
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,300
with what code again reflecting on some

355
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,449
of the talks from earlier in the day and

356
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,979
obviously lambda functions there was an

357
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,109
excellent talk it besides Melbourne

358
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,139
which talked about the capability that

359
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,779
you can do with a lambda function

360
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:51,779
obviously if I create my own malicious

361
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:54,569
lambda function I can use that to deploy

362
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:57,420
code further to as like a persistent

363
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:59,279
store I can use it to modify the

364
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,409
templates and golden images and deploy

365
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,490
my own I can spit up my own machines and

366
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:08,760
storage accounts are pretty well known

367
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,959
for storing malicious content so

368
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,959
obviously there's a few challenges

369
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,299
throughout all this festival

370
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,760
understanding all the terminology

371
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:19,439
there's a huge amount of work there and

372
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,929
then sort of tailoring your security

373
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,939
program that show obviously has a lot of

374
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:26,970
solutions and a lot of tools in place

375
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:28,980
for a lot of this and you've obviously

376
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,140
got your own tools your in procedures

377
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,909
you want to like meld the two together

378
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,289
you want to find the best of both worlds

379
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:36,659
you want to take advantage of what Asia

380
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:39,450
has to offer and you also want to melt

381
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:42,990
it in with your current procedures and

382
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:49,080
obviously policy really fantastic for

383
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:51,780
stopping misused identities so which

384
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,250
falls back to making sure permissions

385
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:57,158
are correct access is correct

386
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,429
and keeping on top of where everyone's

387
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,870
going how things are going on top of

388
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,110
that I'll cover a little bit more later

389
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,959
about the environment itself it is

390
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,178
constantly changing is if you're not on

391
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,950
top of it it's just going to make life

392
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,330
hard because new capability is going to

393
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,789
come out the things are going to change

394
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,500
and if you're not on top of it then

395
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:20,320
potentially you're opening yourself up

396
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,009
just simply because of not being able to

397
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,820
keep on top of it so coming back to that

398
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:29,799
constantly evolving in the last month or

399
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,889
so there's been two massive features

400
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,009
that have come out as your Sentinel and

401
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:37,899
as your ATP

402
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:40,480
well not ATP itself ATP's been around

403
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:42,610
for a while but ATP actually released a

404
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,620
threat and vulnerability assessment so

405
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,539
if you've used the net like 7ss or

406
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,928
course they've now got their own

407
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:52,450
equivalent that works across the Azure

408
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:54,399
environment it will tell you what

409
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,240
software is running the vulnerable

410
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:59,889
versions of what's running any potential

411
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,740
vulnerabilities you may be housing or

412
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:06,750
running and then as your Sentinel is now

413
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:09,100
then you seem that's been released just

414
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,110
there's a huge amount of changes that

415
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,240
are going on a huge amount of investment

416
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,820
and improvements are going on so

417
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,529
obviously there's like new capability

418
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,019
that is coming out often which can help

419
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:23,190
you you may not have the license for it

420
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:25,960
but at least that option is there so

421
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,419
always always try and keep on top of

422
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,879
what's changing I can either help you

423
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:35,230
out or at least give you a new option

424
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:37,809
there is a few problems we did come

425
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,610
across so the most interesting one is

426
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,649
probably Windows Defender versus the

427
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,500
Microsoft monitoring agent so the

428
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:47,320
Microsoft monitoring agent feeds into

429
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,179
Azure security center to feed a lot of

430
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,689
the automated alerts I just sort of

431
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:54,909
builds on it uses a very machine

432
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,200
learning oriented program so you

433
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:58,120
obviously want to feed it the good

434
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,299
daughter it needs to be able to register

435
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:04,119
when bad stuff happens there's actually

436
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:06,820
a priority though so if you run or

437
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,230
attempt to run Remy cuts for instance we

438
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,689
just

439
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,370
we'll pick it up first make sense it's

440
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,950
what you want to happen it's best case

441
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,260
right but it won't get fit into

442
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,880
Microsoft monitoring agent so it means

443
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,879
as your secure centaur

444
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,640
may not be seeing alerts while defender

445
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,179
is which comes back to overlapping your

446
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,220
security making sure that you're using

447
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,309
taking advantage of what sorry there as

448
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,660
well as your own tools procedures and a

449
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:35,330
lot of the path services where you

450
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,450
simply don't have that level of control

451
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,949
because it's your scope you need to

452
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,110
think of ways to be able to monitor them

453
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,990
fortunately Microsoft have a few good

454
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,270
ways for which I'll cover a little bit

455
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:51,000
and obviously with things changing it

456
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:53,910
doesn't take much for something new to

457
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,500
be introduced there is a reliance on

458
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,620
machine learning as I sort of hinted at

459
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,080
before which means that you need to make

460
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,399
sure good data is being fed into it but

461
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,710
unfortunately there is a bit of a

462
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,160
two-week window for that baseline to be

463
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,110
filled

464
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,380
which means in that two-week window you

465
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,729
may not beginning in yellow at all

466
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,790
obviously this is like constantly

467
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,320
evolving agile devops environment that

468
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,870
could be pretty difficult to then make

469
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,059
sure that like something is even up for

470
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,620
two weeks nevertheless being baseline

471
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:27,770
properly but this comes back to

472
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,299
monitoring the whole CICE pipeline

473
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,600
making sure you understand what's

474
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:36,240
happening throughout the process to see

475
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:39,149
is there something this that we can like

476
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,490
integrate properly is it something we

477
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,080
need to consider to not consider or do

478
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,049
we have other controls in place that

479
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,799
will take it we'll handle these

480
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:51,960
situations and then at the end of the

481
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,240
day we've got to consider like do we

482
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,490
trust the platform itself

483
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,600
it's Microsoft they seem Prasad we're

484
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:03,240
probably screwed if we don't anyway so

485
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,750
so as I was talking about our Security

486
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,020
Center it's basically where all the xi

487
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,030
alerts and events get fed into this

488
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,410
includes some of the past services ones

489
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,649
which I'll show you how to set up in a

490
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,110
little bit but basically it's your

491
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,910
one-stop-shop for any alert going off in

492
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,449
any use

493
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:26,660
any of tenants you'll see it all it's

494
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:29,240
pretty good has a few false positives

495
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,410
but you can tune them out but better to

496
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,580
be overloaded than under Leonard

497
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:38,090
advanced threat protection and advanced

498
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,070
threat detection the terminology is a

499
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,439
little bit of a pain because when I was

500
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,750
referring to ATP or advanced threat

501
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,060
protection before or is referring to an

502
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,890
agent they also have advanced threat

503
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,740
protection which is also called advanced

504
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,570
threat detection for past services so

505
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,270
coming back to our previous question of

506
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:58,639
how do we monitor our past services this

507
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:02,300
is the thing for you it's a simple tick

508
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,090
box they can then provide tailored logs

509
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,220
which can then be fed into a rescue

510
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,750
center so you can see if someone's

511
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,310
trying to brute-force your SQL pass

512
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:15,740
instance the logging diagnostic locks or

513
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:18,830
the OMS locks they can be a valuable

514
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,910
source very big so keep that in mind if

515
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,600
you're trying to feed it into your own

516
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:27,320
seam but obviously what a valuable data

517
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,449
from your computer resources and as your

518
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,100
policy and compliance is definitely a

519
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,600
requirement I would say if you're

520
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,520
looking at anything with Azure and you

521
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,120
don't have as your policy you're already

522
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,889
seeing yourself up for failure so this

523
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,929
is the the policy was talking about I'm

524
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,500
not going to go through and set up a

525
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:49,220
policy because it's whole world of

526
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,980
complexity but it is literally like

527
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,290
group policy can be to play through JSON

528
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,990
so you can actually create functions

529
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:58,850
that will deploy it it can be deployed

530
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:04,400
the subscription and the resource group

531
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:06,139
level it could be you can create groups

532
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,320
of them together so you can actually be

533
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,940
able to fool multi layer policies that

534
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,290
can be deployed to make life easy for

535
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:18,950
yourself and yeah valuable right here

536
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:20,690
take this one way coming back to the

537
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,810
advanced threat protection a transfers

538
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,460
threat divert detection stuff I don't

539
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,530
know how well you can see that but

540
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,200
basically under each of the SQL pass

541
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:33,129
services you'll find a little security

542
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,930
tab under there it's just a simple

543
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:39,490
tick-box there is a little cost but

544
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,690
everything's a little cost rate so are

545
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,880
you willing to pay it for a little bit

546
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,460
more security or not so it's your call

547
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,950
as an organization I would recommend it

548
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,780
it'll finish rescue center makes life

549
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:54,400
easy there are some limitations but they

550
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,950
could have changed since I last checked

551
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,530
simply because this changes so much so

552
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:05,560
ATP was released late last year for

553
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:07,030
storage accounts and SQL pass for

554
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,389
storage accounts they only covered a

555
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,920
blob but I won't be surprised if that's

556
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,990
actually now already expanded to cover

557
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:20,470
the rest of the components of a storage

558
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:23,260
account so a few tips check your Asia

559
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,150
policy and your compliance your

560
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,520
compliance basically reflects how much

561
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,740
of your policy has been applied so if

562
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,900
you are not seeing a complete policy

563
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,570
being applied compliance will complain

564
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,940
to you and bad you and make sure you

565
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:39,429
have a somewhere until it gets done

566
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,820
check out advanced protection and a

567
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:45,790
France advanced threat data security for

568
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,550
your past services because they could be

569
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:52,659
a bit of a lifesaver especially for SQL

570
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:54,389
for storage practice simulations it's

571
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,310
not as simple as just plugging in and go

572
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,740
especially if your overlapping tools you

573
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:02,169
want to make sure that you know

574
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,290
end-to-end what you can do what you

575
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:07,210
can't do what capabilities you have what

576
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:10,960
gaps you may have and how you can

577
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,730
rectify and restore that now because of

578
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,850
a lot of the Azure capability can do a

579
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:19,690
lot of automation after forensics not a

580
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:21,580
hundred percent but it's pretty good

581
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,990
we'd recommend at least experimenting

582
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:27,879
with it making life easier for yourself

583
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:29,710
is a insert responder especially like

584
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,380
making use of some of the other tools

585
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,210
we're going to a new platform to help

586
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,930
developers want to help yourselves as

587
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:40,500
well right as your identity logs sorry

588
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:44,179
as your activity logs are your friends

589
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,090
fantastic resource for detecting

590
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:49,400
not not read events but any change any

591
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,029
deletion attempt any write attempt for

592
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,970
any resource in any resource group

593
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:58,220
within your environment fantastic and of

594
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:02,720
course everyone loves a good honeypot

595
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:05,690
right so yeah there was a few lessons we

596
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,750
took away especially relating to the

597
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,940
design you can't necessarily go in with

598
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,679
a traditional design in mind you need to

599
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,990
look at the environment look at what

600
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,029
things it's capable of doing how it will

601
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:20,750
benefit you and take advantage of some

602
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:23,210
of those the management plan itself of

603
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,950
course should be limited to his little

604
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:28,399
activity interactive activity as

605
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,860
possible so keep that in mind for you

606
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:34,489
design don't go giving every dev an

607
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:37,789
account to jump on coming back to my

608
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:40,340
point from earlier permissions and

609
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:42,529
identity are kings so make sure they are

610
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:45,139
limited keep them as little as possible

611
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:47,779
just the scope they need anything

612
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,399
further you're asking for trouble keep

613
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,919
in mind that this is actually just one

614
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:56,059
small spot one small part of a bigger

615
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,039
pipeline so make sure it like integrates

616
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:01,370
nicely make sure you've got steps to

617
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:02,899
cover every step in the process and we

618
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,229
need to sort of learn as a security

619
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:07,459
component to start to shift as faster

620
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:11,570
some of the environments we're dealing

621
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,730
with are changing so I got a bit of

622
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,470
further reading if you're keen there was

623
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,990
a fantastic talk at besides Melbourne

624
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,789
about a container security and pipeline

625
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,970
security I would definitely recommend

626
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:24,169
that and there was recently a fantastic

627
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,039
talk that covered as your Active

628
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:29,120
Directory Troopers server in Germany

629
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,210
brilliantly if you want to cover some of

630
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,979
the stuff there and of course if I have

631
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,919
anoon about Sarah's talk I was thrown in

632
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,559
here too because that was brilliant to

633
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,580
give people a second just to take that

634
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,580
but are any questions

635
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:50,460
I have one you guys are obviously so how

636
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,840
long have you been doing is it like you

637
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:57,570
mentioned you guys have gone is twelve

638
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,570
months twelve months actually probably

639
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,580
not five months so how I and and I'm

640
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,320
asking because I know our experiences

641
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,330
how is your team gone trying to get

642
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,490
their head around this and get to a

643
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,019
point not only because of all the

644
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,519
newness and all the new terms but the

645
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,590
constant rate of change as well like

646
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,510
security nerds do not deal well with I

647
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,639
set that up yesterday and today it's

648
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,820
completely different it was definitely

649
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:22,709
something we have to shift it was the

650
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,899
huge hurdle of learning cloud to begin

651
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:28,200
with from a more traditional Sauk

652
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:30,059
environment and then going okay we've

653
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,490
got this nice design in mind

654
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,379
it looks so we've tests it and then our

655
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,940
change will come out and we go actually

656
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,210
there's something that can help us even

657
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,399
more so now we're staying to have to get

658
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,230
to that sort of well it's changing

659
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,449
there's new features why don't we

660
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,519
automate where it'll help out so we can

661
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:51,779
keep on top of that be better so it's

662
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,059
it's definitely a concept shift changing

663
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:55,889
the culture of the team but they doing

664
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:59,820
okay with it yeah I hope so

665
00:29:55,889 --> 00:30:00,209
yeah I think so any questions from the

666
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,610
audience

667
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:07,139
I understand microsoft offers iron there

668
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,418
have it do you know anything about that

669
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,949
servers how good it is is it an option

670
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,840
instead of trying to keep up with it

671
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,760
especially for the medium-sized and

672
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,350
smaller organizations who they dislodge

673
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,510
a ticket and was it gonna cost them a

674
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,370
nominally comes with your support

675
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,019
agreement with Microsoft so it's pretty

676
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,629
much you can call them up you can say

677
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:26,519
hey under our agreement we've been given

678
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,340
I think it's credits they deal with and

679
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,049
you can run through that they seem

680
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:35,158
pretty receptive pretty good from the

681
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:36,750
dealings I've heard of course I have the

682
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,659
full pipeline I have two full visibility

683
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,880
so having just what they can provide

684
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:44,340
it's a small part of a bigger picture so

685
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,260
I tend to rely my own forensics and earn

686
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,120
I had a couple of scripts I was gonna

687
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,429
release I just never got around to up

688
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,320
getting him for this unfortunately so it

689
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:54,929
might really snows later but yeah this

690
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,789
there's definitely some things they

691
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:57,110
could provide you but I think it's just

692
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:00,440
a

693
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:03,399
all part of a bigger picture and you had

694
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,400
a question up on it back

695
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,629
[Music]

696
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:13,979
so that the question was around up the

697
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:17,009
sorts of policies that you guys have

698
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:19,769
built or deployed or play with the depth

699
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:22,229
of policies is just insane I'd be here

700
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:25,109
for days just to try and cover like a

701
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:27,299
small fraction of them so it's literally

702
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:28,379
a matter of going checking they

703
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,979
literally have like a library you can

704
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:33,178
search across already pre-configured

705
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:35,749
policies and you can just go yes I want

706
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:39,929
this so hey I want to slightly change it

707
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:41,369
yeah ludicrously insane it's like a much

708
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,219
nicer version a group policy though you

709
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:45,688
don't have to scroll for days the the

710
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:47,879
security baseline stuff that they've

711
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:50,219
worked on and keep updating he's

712
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:51,389
actually pretty good now if you in just

713
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:53,309
in terms of if you're getting started

714
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:54,448
it's actually a pretty good starting

715
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:55,979
point it's probably not gonna work in

716
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:57,899
everyone's environment but it gives you

717
00:31:55,979 --> 00:31:59,699
an idea of all the sorts of things you

718
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:01,319
should be looking at just like you get

719
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:03,689
GPO templates and everything else kind

720
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,428
of things so that I haven't played with

721
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:07,559
it or experienced it but apparently is a

722
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:09,869
security baseline equivalent for a show

723
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,899
and you can finish run it and give you

724
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:15,919
the policies you should be enacting or

725
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:17,178
recommend it to next

726
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,860
let's get a big round of applause for

727
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:20,860
show thanks very much dude

728
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,490
you
