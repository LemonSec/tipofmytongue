[Music]

2
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:21,570
thank you for hanging with us

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,390
we've saved something good for the end

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,180
no pressure

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:30,930
please give Eric a round of applause

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,668
thank you so show of hands he thinks I'm

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,489
gonna suck the most because they put me

8
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,949
last I've gone from keynote two years

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,190
ago to either footnote or a bum note

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,469
speaking in so I'm not really using

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,940
Windows 3.1 but it's twenty-seven years

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,879
old today

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,039
make you feel only risky risks are risky

14
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,120
Astrix especially when nobody

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,989
understands risk so first up I apologize

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,370
in advance

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,709
risky risks can be very boring talking

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,568
about risks is boring or worst of all

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,040
people who want to listening to people

20
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:07,050
who want to talk about risks is very

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,790
boring so I will do my best to not make

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,009
it boring however I've sat through some

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,130
talks that have gone so over my head

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,140
today that it's my turn to get to get

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,839
revenge now to all you technical people

26
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,020
I'm gonna I'm gonna get gog RC on your

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,850
ass right so Fordyce worth I've sat

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,399
through hundreds of presentations by

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,820
risk professionals and being bought out

30
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,740
of my tree for some reason risk

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,320
professionals always have a hobby which

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,000
is like extreme sports or BASE jumping

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,250
or flying and they always go on and on

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,890
about flying and crashes and black box

35
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,859
recorders I promise I've I've only got

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,170
one slide with a plane on it right so

37
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,899
let's dive in so the premise of the talk

38
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,070
is is the way I've sold it to get my

39
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,810
paper accepted was that nobody

40
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,469
understands risk obviously somebody

41
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,090
understands risks me what I'm really

42
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,669
getting at is that I think there's a lot

43
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,640
of misconceptions around the concepts of

44
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,619
risks especially in this industry and

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,079
they kind of propagate up there's this

46
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,119
often this house of cards that exist and

47
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,060
we kind of add to it and add to it and

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,670
add to it and I think it's fun to try to

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,350
I thought it would be a fun thing to try

50
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,570
and unpack what was going on or at least

51
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:23,099
what I thought I was going on based on

52
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:24,840
the observations that I've had so if you

53
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,879
are willing and you

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,750
to yourself a risk-taker then join me on

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,980
this magical risk yeah I work for

56
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,840
Trustwave now so I was told I wasn't

57
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,590
allowed to have any gifts or anything a

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,959
reverence sir alright let's start at the

59
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,489
very beginning so Vitaly

60
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:48,090
cam look went on a plane and saw this in

61
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,819
his seat back and if you think about

62
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,290
that Vitaly cam look I don't speak

63
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,230
Russian but I think that is basically

64
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,310
Russian for my whole life is looking for

65
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:02,069
cameras so as was his destiny he saw

66
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,829
this thing in the seat back and he

67
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:06,060
tweeted it and he was pretty rational

68
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:09,090
about it he's like hey I saw this since

69
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,650
I think it's a camera to know any pinged

70
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,640
Singapore Airlines and they went yeah

71
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,810
it's a camera it's turned off but we we

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,879
thought we might use it in the future

73
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,430
for gesture tracking so when you're

74
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,170
watching a movie on a plane or something

75
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,290
but predictably the InfoSec side of

76
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,768
Twitter went into meltdown and there was

77
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,720
all of this crap that was like oh

78
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,870
they're spying only the spying on you

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,190
and it amazed me that a lot of risk

80
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,930
professionals came out and so I had a

81
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,880
risk InfoSec professionals came out and

82
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,489
said yeah this is why I always travel

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,040
with the roll of electrical tape my

84
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,769
favorite one my favorite one was the guy

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,090
on LinkedIn for the technical people in

86
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,670
the audience that if you did not

87
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,510
LinkedIn it's like Twitter but wearing a

88
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,790
suit and with a little pinch of cocaine

89
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,679
this guy on LinkedIn was was having this

90
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,888
rant and his his premise was that

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,349
they're using facial recognition so that

92
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,880
they can work out who you are and I'm

93
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,099
kind of like dude you're on a plane

94
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,620
which you're paid for with your credit

95
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,298
card they know who you are your credit

96
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,739
card number you they know where you're

97
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,299
going and they know when you're coming

98
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,789
back they don't need to use facial

99
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,829
recognition also the network engineer in

100
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,779
me was kind of trying to think about the

101
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,750
logistics of streaming the video from

102
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,919
300 seats on a plane and I know that

103
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,970
when you hit pause when you're watching

104
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,620
a movie on a plane there's a

105
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,210
three-second lag before actually pauses

106
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,830
and I'm wondering if that's because

107
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,810
there's all the band which is consumed

108
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,270
by all the video there

109
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,340
and then I'm comfortable who hell wants

110
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,109
to watch me sitting on a plane so anyway

111
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,840
I went to work and I happen to work with

112
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,850
a few people who are ex Intel community

113
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,200
and I had a big run over a coffee with

114
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,669
someone that used to be a spoken he went

115
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,349
yeah yeah of course when I was a spy we

116
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:53,520
had an agreement with the airlines where

117
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,260
there was a particular seat that had a

118
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,690
bug in it and if we had anyone of

119
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,340
interest to people flying we'd upgrade

120
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,230
them to that particular seat and then

121
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,638
we'd be able to record so like well

122
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,020
that's kind of interesting that if

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
you're on a plane and you're a person of

124
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,680
interest then there's a good chance that

125
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,850
they will turn on his camera but they'll

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,130
also turn on the microphone which has

127
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,770
been in your seat for I don't know 20

128
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,159
years so it didn't I don't understand

129
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,950
what was going on with people ranting

130
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,190
and I think oh this this is my

131
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,570
expression for how I felt about this so

132
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,120
I think this is where it all came sort

133
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,270
of where that is stems from which is

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,560
these webcam covers how many of you have

135
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,139
got one of these bad boys and still

136
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,690
don't love thoughts I was quite

137
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,250
interested to walk around the CTF room

138
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,930
earlier on and just have a little bit of

139
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:44,190
a straw poll and how many people in that

140
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,660
room had these cam covers and it warmed

141
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,740
the cockles of my heart that I didn't

142
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,510
actually see that many of them if

143
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,950
through my eye and when I say about

144
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,130
through my eyes looking this from a risk

145
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,810
perspective for someone to be watching

146
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,880
you through your webcam it means that

147
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,650
they've compromised your laptop which

148
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,990
means that they've they're pretty

149
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,090
sophisticated they've got no running

150
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,410
code on your laptop they can see your

151
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,989
files they can see your screen they can

152
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:15,720
listen to your microphone and yet that's

153
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:17,130
the line you decide to draw what's going

154
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,660
on now now I understand that stalker

155
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,060
wear is a thing and it's very bad and

156
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,950
it's prevalent and I understand that

157
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,860
nobody wants to accidentally find that

158
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,000
they've they're in a work Videocon and

159
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,550
they've turned their cam on when they're

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,890
working from a home and they're sort of

161
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,110
butt-naked or something so there

162
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,180
obviously is a time and a place for them

163
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,950
and I started to wonder whether this is

164
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,419
analogy for what we do in info site

165
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,099
which is there are so many variables

166
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,169
that we can't control that are out of

167
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,000
our control but hey here's 10

168
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,830
centimeters of electrical tape at least

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,950
I can do something

170
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:54,460
so I think maybe the answer to this is

171
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,599
in human psychology so I thought well

172
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,729
nobody understands race nobody

173
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,170
understands human psychology so I

174
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,790
thought I'd give you the benefit of the

175
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,060
work that I've done I went and I read an

176
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,790
awful lot about human psychology and I

177
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,600
read white papers and studies and

178
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,380
essentially what I've done

179
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,630
is and I'll share the this with you this

180
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,520
is the benefit of the research that I've

181
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,920
done everything you need to know about

182
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,609
human psychology so the first thing is

183
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,860
people think say and do things they do

184
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,830
this for a variety of reasons some of

185
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,170
those things are completely irrational

186
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,090
some of those things are really dumb and

187
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:34,420
psychology experts can't agree on any of

188
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,760
it so now that you've reached about the

189
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,550
level of a third-year psych major we can

190
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,560
go back to talking about risk so what is

191
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,110
risk here's here's my plane they've got

192
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,760
to have a plane so what I've observed is

193
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,520
that people coming into this industry or

194
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,200
you know sort of risk newbs tend to have

195
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,580
this perception and it's propagated by

196
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,039
all the risk profile the professionals

197
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,080
who do talks about airplanes that we're

198
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,910
in a plane and risk is a mountain and

199
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,010
all we have to do is steer our plane

200
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,480
around the mountain we've eradicated the

201
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,430
risk as long as we don't hit the ground

202
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:10,320
or the mountain everything's good

203
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:14,890
we've treated the risk the ISO 31000

204
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,750
definition of risk is the effect of

205
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,340
uncertainty on objectives which at the

206
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,860
time was a big deal because for the

207
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,299
first time they'd shifted the I'm gonna

208
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,790
use the paradigm word they've shifted

209
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,310
the paradigm to acknowledge that the

210
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,350
effect of uncertainty on objectives can

211
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,210
also be positive and can also be

212
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,909
negative so that kind of threw things

213
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,340
around when I'm trying to explain the

214
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,959
concept of risk to people I kind of put

215
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,430
it a little bit like this which is

216
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,650
rather than a plane and a mountain if

217
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:45,400
you think is yourself being in a ship

218
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:47,470
and risk being Mother Nature and you

219
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,640
pitting your your the wits of your crew

220
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,400
against mother nature

221
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,650
and a risk professional will come along

222
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,180
or or or you know you'll get a report

223
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,160
that effectively says well you need to

224
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,750
eliminate all the risk which essentially

225
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,310
means you need to take your ship and you

226
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,519
need to move it to higher ground

227
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,319
and of course that doesn't really work

228
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,420
not least because a ship at higher

229
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:08,949
ground is just a sort of rusty warehouse

230
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,360
with a sloping floor and really crappy

231
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:13,029
access and now your neighbors think

232
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,060
you're some weird Christian cult but we

233
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,290
we actually need to surround ourselves

234
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,628
for our business to work we need to be

235
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,819
enveloped within risk and we need to

236
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:23,980
surround ourselves and managing risk is

237
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:26,259
deciding not to put too many containers

238
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,449
on the ship or not to take that ship

239
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,009
through that particular waterway during

240
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:30,939
that time of year or so and so forth so

241
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:33,100
that's what we're talking when we're

242
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:35,050
managing risks we're accepting that risk

243
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,839
is opportunity and we have to take those

244
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,490
risks and we have to be pragmatic with

245
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:45,279
it with how we manage it so let's get

246
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:48,430
down to risk in the concept of it

247
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,680
information security and what we're what

248
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,339
we're getting at which is really what my

249
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:58,149
rant stroke talk is about so it's a tool

250
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:59,649
we use to select what we will test it's

251
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,199
a framework we use to measure the

252
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:04,089
findings we have and achieve some sort

253
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:06,758
of consistency consistency is better

254
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,769
than perfection it's the language we use

255
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,500
to communicate those findings to the

256
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,149
business it's the case we build all the

257
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,800
business bills to get some money from

258
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,589
someone - it's a tool we use for social

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,389
engineering cash out of people in suits

260
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,759
and it's the tool used to prioritize our

261
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,259
spot response to those findings and most

262
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,000
importantly of all it's something we

263
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:28,569
used to make our risk registers much

264
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,029
more colorful and this is where the

265
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:32,769
rubber meets the road this is the 5x5

266
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,110
matrix this is where it gets really

267
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:37,509
exciting for me and obviously we've got

268
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,189
the severe stuff right at the top we've

269
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,990
got the green stuff the bottom was the

270
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:43,990
old traffic light system Green is good

271
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:47,470
red is bad the thing of interest is the

272
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,519
little red box down I'm Dyslexic to

273
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,829
interrelate down on the bottom right

274
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,620
corner which is Black Swan events which

275
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:55,839
of those are things that have a

276
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,850
ridiculously big consequence but almost

277
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,170
a negligible likelihood so there the

278
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:04,749
911s the that we can't really do much

279
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:08,378
about from a risk perspective other than

280
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:10,149
insurer but if we don't think about

281
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:12,610
those things and have a conversation

282
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,720
about them that in itself is considered

283
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,240
negligent and it

284
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,579
it's kind of awkward so you you always

285
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,009
have to be kind of mindful of those

286
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:23,138
things but you have to be very wary that

287
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:25,089
you don't throw all of your resources

288
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:26,110
which are finite into worrying about

289
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:27,790
those things that it's kind of why I

290
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,800
think we have concrete blocks on the

291
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,149
corner of every sort of pedestrian

292
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,790
walkway in here because there was an

293
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:37,569
event and everyone had to be seen to be

294
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:40,000
doing something now you can tailor a

295
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:43,300
risk matrix for your organization and

296
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,399
you can actually determine your risk for

297
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,990
apatite if you believe unlike me that a

298
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,139
risk appetite is a thing that you can

299
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,310
actually have and manage and so it's

300
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:53,470
it's not uncommon to see organizations

301
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,939
who've tweaked this a little bit and I

302
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,769
thought what would be fun was to come up

303
00:11:54,939 --> 00:12:02,500
with a kind of an Australian standard

304
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:05,889
for risk matrix so we we use the

305
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:08,529
taxonomy of the of the organizations so

306
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:11,259
yeah now and now yeah I thought it's

307
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:13,209
pretty proud of and of course it's

308
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,829
Australian mentality is she'll be right

309
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:18,819
she'll be right up until the point where

310
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:20,109
it's just I'm upon so obviously the

311
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:22,269
British one's slightly different a

312
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:26,769
little bit more granularity more of a

313
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:28,449
propensity towards tea and biscuits pop

314
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:34,089
bugger pop the kettle on that's the

315
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:35,829
worst that can help ya brexit I'm going

316
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:39,399
with this sorry so the concept of risk

317
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:41,829
as I see it is we come up with some

318
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,120
risks so here we found eight risks

319
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,949
there's another couple of risks that we

320
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,040
haven't found there the unknown unknowns

321
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:51,399
and we've graded them into criticality

322
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,170
using our custom risk register it's

323
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,149
might be a pen test report or a risk

324
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,160
assessment or just a spreadsheet that

325
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,889
Jon Jerry's got on his desk with all the

326
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,490
things that he's worried about we then

327
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:05,470
try to treat some of those risks so

328
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,180
we've now pulled some of the critical

329
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,759
ones a little bit down there we've made

330
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,309
them less problematic we've still got

331
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,500
the ones we don't know about they'll

332
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:16,410
ever make it onto anyone's list and and

333
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:21,160
then what we do we take them to the

334
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,660
organizational risk register and so this

335
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,100
organizational risk Reggie

336
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,850
register I'm talking conceptually

337
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,250
because this doesn't always happen

338
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,740
sometimes what organizations do

339
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,720
is do the thing that CEO got in the lift

340
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,339
and talked to someone about because he'd

341
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,350
seen something on four corners and all

342
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:36,939
we have to worry about X or something so

343
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,850
more mature organizations have this

344
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:42,599
concept of a risk register and they're

345
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:45,069
putting everything into context and

346
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,649
theoretically or realistically speaking

347
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:50,199
an organization has this kind of

348
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:52,240
unspoken dotted line on one side of

349
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,639
which we do something about this and on

350
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,680
the other side of the the dotted line we

351
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,500
do nothing or otherwise know as we put

352
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,638
it in the risk register and once you

353
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,800
understand and start looking through

354
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,420
this lens which is you're always gonna

355
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,399
have the way risk works you have a list

356
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:10,180
of things some of which you do and some

357
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,470
of which you don't do and there's also

358
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,258
the things that you don't even know

359
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,610
about what's interesting is that for

360
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,870
years cybersecurity people have been

361
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,060
going on that the business doesn't

362
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,639
understand it doesn't understand the

363
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,800
risk they don't really and it's often

364
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,139
the business does understand the risk

365
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,430
but what they realize is that in context

366
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,379
with all the other things the business

367
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,449
is worried about none of them actually

368
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:33,490
make it over the line into we need to do

369
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:36,939
something about this and this is where

370
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:40,180
we start to see problems and long rants

371
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:43,719
on LinkedIn about nonsense so let's dig

372
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:46,239
into what I think is going on here it's

373
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,680
a problem number one it's how we measure

374
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,050
risk yeah I know what you're thinking

375
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:56,050
Hamish Blake those stock photos now so

376
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,839
we think I say we the business thinks we

377
00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,229
measure risk with a micrometer when in

378
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,420
fact it is completely finger in the wind

379
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,040
like where things go on that wrist

380
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,930
register and the reason it's finger in

381
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,319
the wind is we just don't have the data

382
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:14,229
we we talk about quantitative data

383
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:15,849
analysis now it's all fiction as 86.2%

384
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,199
of all statistics are made up on the

385
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:22,120
spot I don't really believe that there

386
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,849
is any day so we're getting more data

387
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,800
and we're getting more data at the top

388
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,629
right hand red side of the you know the

389
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,779
stuff that's really common and really

390
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:33,550
high impact we get a little bit more

391
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,829
data on but the rest of it is

392
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,019
wishy-washy nonsense and that's because

393
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:40,059
we can't really calculate things like

394
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,780
the cost of a breach because where do

395
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:42,490
you even begin

396
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:46,240
to try to put numbers on things like

397
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,070
lost opportunity or and how do you not

398
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,540
conflate the cost of putting something

399
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,630
right that should have been right in the

400
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,459
first place with the cost of the cleaner

401
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:57,189
or how do you how do you not include the

402
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,820
cost that you threw down the drain

403
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:04,690
trying to respond to an incident by you

404
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,760
know wasting 40 40 grand on incident

405
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,690
response for a problem that probably

406
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,790
would have only cost the organization

407
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,460
two grand but because you had this

408
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:17,860
retainer you thought let's go let's go

409
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:19,510
and roll IR so the measurements are a

410
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,430
little bit chunky the other thing you'll

411
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:25,090
see over and over again if you do tune

412
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:27,130
in to LinkedIn is the the common cry if

413
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,750
we don't speak the right language the

414
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,920
reason they don't understand the

415
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,720
problems that we're trying to convey is

416
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,550
because we don't speak their language we

417
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,380
need to learn to speak the board's

418
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,420
language and essentially what they're

419
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,120
getting is we need to speak about dollar

420
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,219
values and money and of course we can't

421
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,510
speak about dollar values and monies

422
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,980
with a straight face because we're just

423
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,870
making up all these numbers the next one

424
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,210
is that our worldview is shaped by our

425
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,860
experiences so I saw this years ago when

426
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,540
I started to talk to vendors about who

427
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,460
what what is the problem we should be

428
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,110
worrying about and if you talk to a

429
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,000
vendor that sells denial of service

430
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,950
products they will tell you denial of

431
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,900
service is the worst thing if you talk

432
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,060
to a you know a company that finds a

433
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,500
PT's in your firewall they'll tell you

434
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,329
what hate PT's or where it's all that

435
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,190
and so and at first I thought they were

436
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,730
sort of self-serving and that they were

437
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:17,140
trying to push their own product but

438
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,790
then I realized that if you talk to a

439
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,950
fireman and you say what's the best

440
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,569
alarm system on the market he'll go and

441
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,130
point you at a fire alarm and if you

442
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,329
talk to a copper about the best alarm

443
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,960
system on the market he'll point you at

444
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,399
a burger lon

445
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,690
and that's because the fireman turns up

446
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,210
everyday at somebody's house that just

447
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,130
burnt down and a copper turns up after

448
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,470
they've been burgled so we tend to

449
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,080
conflate what we what is real to us and

450
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,730
what we experience and we pollute the

451
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,540
numbers that we're making up on the fly

452
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,800
so so that's a real problem the next

453
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,409
thing is what I call sort of the

454
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,210
problems with risk modeling which stems

455
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,920
back to a talk i saw years ago where a

456
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,350
guy said do you know you're more at risk

457
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,400
at getting eaten by by killed by a

458
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,059
vending machine than you

459
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,530
are getting eaten by a shark spice is

460
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:01,000
more likely to get killed by a vending

461
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,809
machine than killed by a shark and I

462
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,580
thought the time that's kind of

463
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:05,080
interesting it's probably changed now

464
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,189
because of global warming anomaly but

465
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:12,669
what again is looking through my risky

466
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:15,370
lens I started to then obsess about this

467
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,630
statistic who was going around getting

468
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,280
all the numbers for all the people

469
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,900
who've been eaten but you know it's very

470
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,629
much of some of the clipboard going like

471
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,380
with a shark on a vending machine go one

472
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,450
more for shark

473
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,830
one more for vending machine and then I

474
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,990
thought well hang on a minute III don't

475
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,580
even go in the sea I'm never going to

476
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,580
get eaten by a shark unless there's this

477
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,439
real weird chain of events but I don't

478
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,669
eat a lot of sugary snacks from vending

479
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,850
machines does that count

480
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:43,720
if I smoke and eat sugary snacks from a

481
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:45,070
vending machine and I don't from that is

482
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,320
he gonna tickle my butt so I realized

483
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,689
the whole thing is is nonsense

484
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,340
and yet we use these statistics and we

485
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,650
parrot these statistics that we see in

486
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,129
the newspaper there are complete works

487
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,870
of fiction and our attempts to

488
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,429
physically come up with a number for

489
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,610
something that's so nuanced it's

490
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:05,230
ridiculous so our risk is very good for

491
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,740
coming up with a list and then triaging

492
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,260
it very very quick and dirty that thing

493
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,929
is more important than that thing but

494
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,059
it's not very good at sorting out what

495
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,070
goes on either side of a metaphysical

496
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,690
line which is do something don't do

497
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,178
something and that's where that's where

498
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,990
we start to have issues the other thing

499
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:28,390
which is one of my personal pet hates is

500
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:31,030
for some reason infoset people tend to

501
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,340
have this blind spot where we fail to

502
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,470
fact in the status quo when we look at

503
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,220
something if it's not perfect we're not

504
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,260
interested

505
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,120
it's our perfection is better than

506
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,070
something that's a bit ordinary but

507
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,300
ordinary is still a lot better than

508
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:47,590
rubbish right so you start to see this

509
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,830
don't ever write your passwords down

510
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:52,570
everywhere we share the photos of the

511
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,860
password diary for sale and we go huh my

512
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,600
god somebody's gonna write their

513
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,070
password down in a book well heigh-ho

514
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,750
the alternative is that they used the

515
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,580
same password which is their dog's name

516
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:05,140
for everything so in that context

517
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,280
writing down your passwords if you're

518
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,550
gonna if that's going to allow you to

519
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,620
have different passwords is not about

520
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,330
cloud-based password safes insecure bro

521
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,889
I've heard this a million times don't

522
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,720
put Yuka passwords in the cloud well

523
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,490
again the alternative is that they write

524
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,340
it down in a book right so anything that

525
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,830
is an iterative game biometrics are

526
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,449
inherently flawed because the TSA can

527
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,070
force you to put your finger or they can

528
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,600
they can stick a phone to it on a

529
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,300
corpses finger and they can get into

530
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,129
your phone well the alternative is a

531
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:37,480
four digit PIN that's probably one two

532
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:40,030
three four SMS for multi-factor or don't

533
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,960
use SMS for MFA because because someone

534
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:45,550
can steal your phone well if again if

535
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,550
two-factor or a single fact authors the

536
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:51,760
is the equivalent then SMS for MFA is

537
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,440
pretty damn good and the cloud is just

538
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,620
other people's computers we say glibly

539
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,540
as we shake our heads and but the cloud

540
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,040
in many cases is a hell of a lot more

541
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,810
secure than people running their own

542
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,600
Exchange farms and so on its fourth in

543
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:07,600
2019

544
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:10,060
okay so bringing it home maybe we get

545
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,620
some more time back I thought about the

546
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,250
venue and I thought about the normal

547
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,510
purpose of this venue and I thought that

548
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,640
in honor of that and it's normal

549
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:21,220
function and by the power vested in me I

550
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,450
thought I propose that we all say a vow

551
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,200
so I'd like you to put your right hand

552
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:29,140
on your chest and say after me I insert

553
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,000
name do solemnly vow but I will weigh up

554
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,450
the status quo before unloading on

555
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,610
Twitter that I shall acknowledge that

556
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:40,210
whilst risk is a great tool it's also

557
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:42,490
finger in the wind EAF register

558
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,960
trademark and what is what is more

559
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,760
acknowledged that statistics in this

560
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,350
space are mostly works of fiction and I

561
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,290
will do my best not to further pollute

562
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:54,820
them with my own paranoid delusions and

563
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:57,090
now everybody understands risk oh that

564
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,950
was my final joke and I blew it

565
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,679
webcam covers are the equivalent of

566
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,450
having oven gloves next to your fire

567
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,100
extinguisher if your fire extinguisher

568
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,930
is too hot to use with your bare hands

569
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,550
it's too late to use the fire

570
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:17,650
extinguisher just the just an idea

571
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:20,120
[Applause]

572
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,530
the there's got our I've got questions

573
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,649
but there's gotta be questions from the

574
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,649
audience

575
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,700
what do you get for taking a risk well

576
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,570
you get to not go bankrupt as a company

577
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,030
by taking risk

578
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,280
yeah companies don't get into business

579
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,360
to buy security tools and services

580
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,160
they're getting businesses to get

581
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:55,669
business and we just get in the way so

582
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:57,260
yeah you're right it's yeah like risk is

583
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,740
a bad thing it's not risk is a good

584
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,190
thing

585
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,410
you've just got a tweak it to to match

586
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:09,400
your risk appetite profile

587
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:09,400
well that shirts pretty risky

588
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:31,299
well the obvious answer is the ISO 31000

589
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:35,410
standard which has a template kind of

590
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:38,320
the these other likelihood things that

591
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,600
that populate these buckets that we that

592
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,710
we populate and it's you know rare is

593
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,240
once a year likely is once every six

594
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:51,040
months or so and you can kind of tweak

595
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:54,100
that as you need to but it's it doesn't

596
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,110
really matter as long as when you finish

597
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,678
up doing whatever assessment or whatever

598
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:02,229
work you're doing you have a spread of

599
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,000
risks in different boxes it's absolutely

600
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,190
no use if you get to the end of your

601
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,020
exercise in all your risks or in one box

602
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,460
or or in a straight line because you

603
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,549
haven't what you're trying to do is use

604
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,200
it to to triage things so that you can

605
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:16,090
address one thing before the other thing

606
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,570
it's all it's all it is it's a very

607
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:22,928
quick and dirty tool to help you get

608
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:24,309
some purchase and knowledge that there

609
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,049
is a list of things you're going to end

610
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:28,330
up with you're only gonna have enough

611
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:31,660
time and money and resources to address

612
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:34,330
maybe four of a list of 20 things so

613
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,440
what you need to do is be comfortable

614
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,059
and be able to sleep at night that

615
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,070
you've addressed the four that really

616
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,860
needs to be addressed and more important

617
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,928
you've got a defensible position when

618
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,389
somebody comes to you and with a pointy

619
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:48,850
finger and says why didn't you do this

620
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,799
we just got we just got owned because of

621
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,540
X and you didn't do the thing that would

622
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,260
have stopped that and now you've got

623
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,340
some nice clear well documented

624
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,809
rationale for what we didn't do X

625
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,470
because we didn't have enough money to

626
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:01,570
do that

627
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,100
because we spent it on this and that's

628
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,928
really what it boils down to is a

629
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,110
defensible position which sounds like

630
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:11,970
weasel words but sorry that's a a weird

631
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,969
around about consultative answer

632
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:22,450
I didn't say we don't have okay I'd say

633
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,100
people on LinkedIn write blogs about how

634
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,780
we don't know how to communicate I think

635
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,669
that the communication thing is a it's a

636
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,350
red herring I think we do know how to

637
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:33,250
communicate and I think that the

638
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,659
business understands risk where it kind

639
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,550
of falls down as risk comes I think

640
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,440
probably from the insurance world where

641
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:41,050
they have pages and pages and pages of

642
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,000
data and that data is super accurate and

643
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,379
we've co-opted that system and we're

644
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,850
running with it even though the dirty

645
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,230
secret is we don't actually have any

646
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:55,330
numbers so we just finger in the win

647
00:25:49,230 --> 00:26:03,250
communicate be funny be honest give a

648
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:05,169
 yeah go for it it's an Australian

649
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,500
to deny you this chance to steal stuff

650
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,500
it

651
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:21,319
be guarantee oh I'm not saying that I

652
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:22,728
think the InfoSec industry has been

653
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:25,579
saying that for a long time and I

654
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:28,519
wouldn't take a stand against that

655
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:32,928
premise I think it's probably possible

656
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:35,419
to create a system that isn't yeah isn't

657
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:38,049
insecure but that system would be

658
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:41,299
completely useless right so so I guess

659
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:44,509
the question is if you take your webcam

660
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:46,999
cover sticker off your camera and stick

661
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:50,059
it on your PowerPoint and then wait for

662
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:51,739
the battery to drain now you've just

663
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:55,249
used that tool to make your computer

664
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:57,199
100% secure so conceptually it's

665
00:26:55,249 --> 00:27:00,019
possible but it's it's a scale right and

666
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:01,519
and you've got a risk it is a way to try

667
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:03,889
and find that right trade-off or that

668
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,079
right balance between stupidly secure I

669
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:09,139
need to scan my iris every time I go to

670
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:12,229
the toilet or Yolo we use the same

671
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:14,688
password for everything and they're the

672
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:17,569
only two options are oh yeah yeah it's

673
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:19,899
binary it's firing everyone give it up

674
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,899
Eric

675
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,020
