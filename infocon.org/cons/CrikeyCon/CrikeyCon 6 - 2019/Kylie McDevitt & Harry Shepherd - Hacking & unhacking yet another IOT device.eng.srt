1
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:24,560
so welcome to our hacking and unhak in

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,020
another IOT device so for those that

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,689
aren't aware the a CSC did restructure

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,009
last year in about mid last year we

5
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:35,059
changed venues

6
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:37,520
I mean changed locations and and went

7
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:39,739
into a nice new building and and mugged

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,059
in some extra folk and and we're all

9
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:46,280
happy in there and so today Harry and I

10
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,900
are going to talk over some of some work

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,380
we've done on a project since that

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,300
restructure and since our our mandate

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:57,860
has sort of increased on what we look at

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:02,180
at the a CSC um so as Pat said we we

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,009
both work at the a CSC and this is the

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,350
first time I've actually presented on

17
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,740
behalf of the ACC and same for Harry so

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,479
go easy on us we both work in protector

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,520
sha and an able division which is

20
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,330
responsible for the uplift of security

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,220
across Australia and doing research into

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,408
security issues more specifically

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:27,048
wearing the emerging technology and

24
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:28,549
engineering team so yeah basically what

25
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:32,420
we're going to be having a look at today

26
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:34,280
is we'll give a introduction to IOT have

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,619
a look at some of the classic IOT

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,890
attacks that have been around and give a

29
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:42,290
demo of one of the devices that we found

30
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:45,049
and then look at some of the consumer

31
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,240
advice that we've developed and finally

32
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,619
into some of the vendor advice that

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,789
we're going to be developing in

34
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:55,280
collaboration with some of the policy

35
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:57,619
writers dinner a CSC so what is IOT so

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,689
basically connecting everyday devices up

37
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:04,430
to the internet so they can send and

38
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:05,889
receive data this as we can see as you

39
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,780
can see it's a pretty broad definition

40
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,250
so for our research to research

41
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,739
definition we decided to look into

42
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:17,269
simple single purpose embedded devices

43
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:20,120
and most people are most people think of

44
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:21,830
IOT in primarily the consumer space

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,560
which comes up some of the common

46
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,680
examples being home assistance smart

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,390
devices and

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,189
security however this is a pretty neat

49
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,640
picture from beach and research just

50
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:39,150
showing how big i OT really is and hits

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,879
across all all the main sectors it's bit

52
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,599
hard to regis but we're going to break

53
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,179
it down a little bit so we've got the

54
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,888
building sector how i said across the

55
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,310
hall all areas of building sector

56
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,299
commercial institutional industrial and

57
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,420
basically ranging from functions

58
00:02:54,299 --> 00:03:00,139
anywhere from office and education all

59
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,358
the way through to airports and stadiums

60
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:06,359
common examples include the hvac systems

61
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:08,489
our OTS made this a lot easier for HVAC

62
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,639
technicians to access their data and

63
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:14,250
improve the systems but also ranging

64
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,669
through from transport and the fire and

65
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,760
safety and even the lighting in the

66
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:23,310
energy sector ciot being used more in

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,060
all areas such as supply and demand even

68
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,310
alternative energies and the oil and gas

69
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,690
so we've seen in power generation

70
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:34,859
particularly in energy management so

71
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:37,650
using smart meters etc and also in solar

72
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:43,650
winds using iot in the turbines and

73
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:46,859
windmills to easily collect data in the

74
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,389
health and life science sector iot has

75
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:54,359
been pretty big especially in the

76
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:57,840
elderly area so in the in-home area of

77
00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:01,019
health using iot to easily monitor the

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,319
health of the elderly and even

79
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,900
telemedicine to help diagnose things

80
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:10,290
before having to go to a doctor and just

81
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,979
for convenience in the industrial space

82
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,070
IOT has been being used in the

83
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:19,349
distribution the converting and the

84
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,880
fluid and the resource and automation so

85
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:23,460
we've seen in automation pertain

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,120
particularly the like food and beverage

87
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,630
processing kind of market using iot to

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,289
make the process more efficient and this

89
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:37,320
like so the assembly in packaging in the

90
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:39,300
transportation sector we see both in non

91
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,690
vehicular and vehicles as well as the

92
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,030
imitation systems themselves so air rail

93
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,940
marine as well as the construction of

94
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,159
the roads using IOT to increase the

95
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,990
efficiency as well as in the traffic

96
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:57,900
management navigation so things like

97
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:59,580
tolls and the even signage retail see it

98
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,310
across specialty stores such as fuel

99
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,139
stations so they're often using IOT now

100
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,819
to more accurately read the read the

101
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,400
petrol use from tank to meter making

102
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:14,909
sure the numbers are right as well as in

103
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,400
stores using them in supermarkets for

104
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:22,020
point-of-sale terminals and even

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,669
distribution centers security said a lot

106
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,250
in surveillance

107
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:33,659
smart smart cameras etc in equipment

108
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,639
weapons themselves in tracking so it

109
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:38,490
used a lot in baggage tracking now in

110
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,740
airports to increase the efficiency as

111
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,819
well as in public infrastructure so

112
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,240
using it to monitor building

113
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,250
environments even emergency services are

114
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,099
using IOT more now especially in the

115
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,319
ambulances so they use IOT to pass data

116
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,389
from the patient back and forth to the

117
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,810
hospital so they can have a record as

118
00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:01,169
soon as they've entered the hospital IT

119
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,909
networks is pretty self-explanatory its

120
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:04,440
internet it's going to be connected up

121
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:06,779
so things such as your servers and your

122
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:12,060
storage or more often on the Internet

123
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:14,699
and PCs and tablets however what we're

124
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,830
gonna be focusing on mostly today is the

125
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,300
consumer and home market that's what

126
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,979
we've been looking into as Carley said

127
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,949
we're part of protection ashore so we're

128
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:25,889
looking at protecting the Australian

129
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,960
community so it's across infrastructure

130
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,129
awareness and safety and even most

131
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,979
commonly of convenience and

132
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,919
entertainment so we're looking at the

133
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,680
energy management that your smart meters

134
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,680
we're looking at power protection

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:45,270
climate and appliances such as your

136
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,180
smart devices so some of the key IOT

137
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,889
statistics in 2008 the number of

138
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,700
Internet connected internet connected

139
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:55,500
things like globally exceeded population

140
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,229
this has continued to grow even as

141
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,710
recently as 2017-2018 in the Australian

142
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:04,950
market increased by over 50% this is

143
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,210
mainly due to every second hundred 27

144
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,750
new devices are connected to the

145
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,510
Internet and this year 1.9 billion smart

146
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,280
home devices are expected to be shipped

147
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,050
leading to more than 64 billion IOT

148
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:22,739
devices being connected worldwide by

149
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:26,250
2025 so that was a huge definition for

150
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,400
IOT and so you know as Harry's indicated

151
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:32,340
it's a massive topic for us

152
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,219
he said that in six years they'll be 64

153
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,219
billion IOT devices out on the internet

154
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,700
so that's about 9 devices per person and

155
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:45,090
that's really 64 billion IOT Internet

156
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,979
connected microphones videos sensors

157
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,219
that could be around your home your

158
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,630
workplace down your street in your car

159
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:56,070
so we definitely wanted to have a look

160
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:58,560
at this so classically most people would

161
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,700
realize embedded security manufacturers

162
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,370
thought they could get away with

163
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,890
security by obscurity they thought their

164
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,780
firmware is embedded and closed source

165
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,390
and that attackers wouldn't be able to

166
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,090
get to it but I think we most of us here

167
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,250
know that they were they're pretty wrong

168
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,289
so vulnerability researchers sort of

169
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,330
over the past decade have been pulling

170
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,940
off firmware and finding bugs such as

171
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,280
you know just general buggy code or

172
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,410
embedded default passwords that are

173
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,609
current be changed or then to place

174
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,470
backdoors they're in there for

175
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,680
troubleshooting so they can remote in

176
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,479
and fix your device so we'll quickly go

177
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,729
over a few of the major issues that have

178
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,330
come up in IOT in the past couple of

179
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:41,070
years just so we're all on the same page

180
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,140
so mirror botnet has everyone heard of

181
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,560
Mirai or can I hands up if you've heard

182
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,400
of Mirai I see everyone so I'll keep it

183
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,239
brief so Mirai was a botnet that

184
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:56,130
attacked Internet of Things or routers

185
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,740
it used it looked its can die peacefully

186
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,840
Pantone that and then just used default

187
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,660
username passwords to get into the

188
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,490
device it was then used to launch DDoS

189
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,209
attacks and and the one up on the screen

190
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,490
is the dinner

191
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:10,618
attack against the US telecommunications

192
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,850
network and so you can see that outage

193
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:19,110
that affected the US has a run herd of

194
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:23,579
IOT Reaper hands up if you yep so a year

195
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,459
later and a more sophisticated botnet

196
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,929
was released across the IOT network

197
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:31,349
instead of using default usernames and

198
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:32,939
passwords to get in it used for 'nor

199
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,980
abilities that were in the routers and

200
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,929
instead of DDoS attacks it just sort of

201
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,999
lurked there so we know this is a

202
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:44,009
growing problem this is a recent botnet

203
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:46,800
so back back at work we had a new

204
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,470
building that we needed to break in we

205
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,479
decided to build an IOT lab and it it

206
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,920
surprisingly didn't take a lot of effort

207
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,860
to get to a point where we could start

208
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,889
finding bugs so I just just took these

209
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,389
photos before I left from left to right

210
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,550
we have sort of the Google home that

211
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:06,179
Harry is pulling apart at the moment a

212
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,149
power supply microscope so we could have

213
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:12,589
a good look at chips and not you know do

214
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:16,110
our eyes in hot hot air Multimedia

215
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:17,939
multimeter a router there on the right

216
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,119
and we use the bus side a fair bit -

217
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:23,459
which was from besides last year we also

218
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:25,799
have an extractor because I think

219
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,859
Harry's made it smell a bit in there a

220
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:32,399
few times when we set off the fire

221
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,410
alarms pulling those yeah these are the

222
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,249
chips on the Google home or epoxy then

223
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:40,889
they're so hard to get off anyway so we

224
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:43,019
we started extracting firmware we use

225
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,610
sort of you know the similar methods

226
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,980
that everyone else has used that in the

227
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,439
Hat in the hacker community so you

228
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,299
aren't has been pretty useful giving us

229
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:53,279
a console on to the device seeing why

230
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:56,970
it's crashing it's actually what we use

231
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,709
in our demo JTAG we haven't has had as

232
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,420
much success because it's not always

233
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:03,479
available but that will give you a debug

234
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,209
option and spiars been great as well for

235
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,639
pulling off firmware so we don't only

236
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,170
use it for IOT device we actually used

237
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,749
it here in this picture for a thin

238
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,779
client that had a data that we needed to

239
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:17,760
get off so we've got the the connector

240
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:23,700
clip there and using the bus silence

241
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,860
to pull the pull the fam we're off so

242
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,230
yeah our plan was to do a live demo

243
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,780
getting into the Google nest cam we

244
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,030
tested this on Wednesday we reported it

245
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,510
to reported at a while ago and

246
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:40,380
unfortunately it's now been patched or

247
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:42,720
unfortunately / fortunately but we do

248
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:53,010
have a video of when it worked because

249
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:58,890
we became prepared so basically we used

250
00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:01,530
HDI tool and GAAP to do this set the

251
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:06,120
computer up to mimic a mobile device and

252
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:09,449
used Bluetooth Low Energy to get in we

253
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,300
did a search found the nest cam and then

254
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:18,510
using a tool were able to connect to the

255
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:25,199
device oh yeah so the video here is at

256
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:27,689
the front of our new building so connect

257
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,720
in we could then able to look at the

258
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,700
characteristics of the device using what

259
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,810
we found earlier getting into the vise

260
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,640
by you are

261
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:43,650
we know that the fffd tag is the set up

262
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:47,760
property so yet we write to the command

263
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,680
and then write FF which causes a

264
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,080
segmentation fault

265
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,250
and this crashes the camera for two

266
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:59,460
minutes so the livestream here we'll

267
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,040
just keep continue and then if we look

268
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:04,110
closely we'll see it jump to and have

269
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,060
one of our colleagues who walked out the

270
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,720
front and stood in the middle of the

271
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,489
carpark this and the camera doesn't

272
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,730
track him at all until he just appears

273
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:17,220
in the middle but so basically how this

274
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,890
works is the Google Nest by default is

275
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,190
set to notify the user after 10 minutes

276
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:25,020
that it's been disconnected so by only

277
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,720
having it disconnected for two minutes

278
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,460
we're able to bypass that being an

279
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,310
outdoor camera

280
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:35,040
pretty simple you can see people could

281
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,650
use it for disconnect the camera walk

282
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,750
past do what they want to disconnect it

283
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:47,160
back again on the way out job done but

284
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:58,800
so should be about to come back online

285
00:13:47,160 --> 00:14:01,350
now so pretty much while it's crashed

286
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,839
you could break into a building or sneak

287
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,339
past and do dumpster diving or anything

288
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:11,550
you wanted that that camera was pretty

289
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:13,350
pretty much protecting against so here's

290
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,900
recover I don't know if you can see Alex

291
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,450
fair standing out on the carpark he just

292
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,120
appeared out of nowhere like magic our

293
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,160
demo was going to be like stealing drop

294
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
he and it it would have worked well

295
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:41,130
right up until when Google patched the

296
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:44,430
device so yeah basically how we found or

297
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:46,200
so yeah good Ness cams was there

298
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,120
basically manufacturer of smart home

299
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,029
products their thermostats smoke

300
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:56,390
detectors security systems and we're

301
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:58,500
quite by Google in 2014 and rebranded to

302
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,120
introduce the nest cam branding of

303
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,640
security cameras in 2015

304
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,100
basically how we found the segmentation

305
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,569
fault the the bug that we were using is

306
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,430
this is a pre-existing exploit that was

307
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,670
using a buffer overflow condition over

308
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,229
Bluetooth Low Energy once we saw that

309
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,699
this has been answered came out at under

310
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,440
public disclosure we decided to take a

311
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,160
look at it and see whether how well it

312
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,910
had been patched so how this exploit

313
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:30,089
which was buffer overflow on the past

314
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:32,400
encrypted password and the Chris

315
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:35,550
encrypted password setting and so what

316
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,380
we went through and we tested was just

317
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,359
seeing if anything else sent to it would

318
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,490
cause a similar issue and by sending

319
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,200
just FF we've worked out that it caused

320
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,320
a segmentation fault and effective

321
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,660
he causes the same crash and you get

322
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:54,600
your two minutes of camera being offline

323
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:56,280
again yeah so to add just phrases and

324
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,870
gives you a spinning wheel so if you're

325
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,120
monitoring you can see the cameras not

326
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,980
quite working but as an outdoor cam

327
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,740
you're not really noticing in these do

328
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,480
people detection as well so once it's

329
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,910
frozen for that two minutes the People

330
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,950
detection doesn't work it's not

331
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:22,589
streaming and you can just walk straight

332
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:25,590
past okay so given that where we are the

333
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,290
Australian cybersecurity Center we

334
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,910
wanted to focus a little bit on how big

335
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:34,530
the problem was here locally in

336
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:37,079
Australia and not just worldwide so we

337
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,790
decided to see how many people in

338
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,860
Australia were comment commonly leaving

339
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,449
their IOT devices exposed on the

340
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:47,160
Internet so we went to good old shootin

341
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,290
so showdown as an Internet scanner I'm

342
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,170
sure everyone's aware of this pretty

343
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,730
much net cuts out to IPS and ports and

344
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,310
does a banner grab to see what's on that

345
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,440
port so what we did we see we we

346
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,469
investigated the devices in their au

347
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,750
domain but we didn't bother I mean we we

348
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,760
didn't connect to them we didn't try to

349
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,310
brute force into people's devices we

350
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,569
just are showing what's out there on the

351
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:14,790
Internet so firstly we looked at IP

352
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,260
cameras and and this is an exhaustive

353
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,959
I'm sure there's other IP cameras

354
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,609
strings that I haven't looked at it was

355
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,060
more just to get that sort of sense on

356
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:25,948
on how we're faring around the world so

357
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,319
I got four thousand three hundred and

358
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:31,140
sixty two IP cameras are out in

359
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:35,220
Australia at the moment online we then

360
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,720
looked at routers and I think what

361
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,540
probably stands out most here is the

362
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,000
three hundred and seventy thousand TP

363
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:46,860
links out in Australia online at the

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,400
moment which I mean I think I met

365
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,959
another major ISPs are giving TP links

366
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,660
as part of their packages to customers

367
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,900
so what it shows to us is that most

368
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,600
consumers are probably just

369
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,990
keeping with the router that I I is P is

370
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,240
giving them again I didn't find many

371
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,160
Smart TVs but not exhaustive that I'm

372
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:16,480
sure there's some out there in DVRs as

373
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:17,680
well but I wanted keep going so I wanted

374
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,150
to sort of make it a bit more

375
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,560
comparative because like I said it's not

376
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,570
exhaustive so it doesn't mean a lot

377
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,790
unless we sort of compare the same sort

378
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,919
of searches across another domain so I

379
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:31,300
had I ran the same searches across the

380
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,580
US and then I did a per percentage per

381
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,490
population percentage just to see how we

382
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:39,610
were faring so for the US versus the AU

383
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,530
when we look at IP cameras I think we're

384
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,629
we're pretty much exposing

385
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:46,240
percentage-wise the same and that same

386
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,810
amount maybe just different vendor

387
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,670
selections but when we looked at our

388
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:54,940
routers we're probably a little bit

389
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,950
behind here and I will put a disclaimer

390
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,020
in there that this is per per population

391
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,900
so overall the u.s. still have a lot

392
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,120
more routers out there online but per

393
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:13,090
our population we have a percentage

394
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:16,330
higher okay so we thought what can we do

395
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,490
to fix this so we had a lot of fun and

396
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:21,070
we've pulled off a lot of firmware and

397
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,230
we've fixed a lot of bugs with vendors

398
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,530
but we can't it's not sustainable to do

399
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,580
this it's not going to make a big impact

400
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,180
so we wanted to do something a little

401
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:35,939
bit more to scale that can fix more

402
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,940
routers for people or more IOT devices

403
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,189
so looking at what people are doing on

404
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,560
scale so my critique vigilante has

405
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:49,600
anyone heard of this hands up yeah

406
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,970
pretty popular so October 2008 last late

407
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,100
last year

408
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:58,420
my Russian sysadmin cord Alexei thought

409
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:00,850
he would save the IOT world and claims

410
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,830
to have logged in to 10,000 routers and

411
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,750
patched them and then he added a

412
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,960
firewall rule in that would stop outside

413
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,710
networks connecting in on the firewall

414
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,590
rule he

415
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,169
to comment to let people contact him he

416
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,939
said about 50 people contacted him most

417
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,730
of them were furious that he had jumped

418
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:22,240
into their router and decided to fix it

419
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,909
so yeah he wasn't super popular but if

420
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,149
we take a look at how this affects the

421
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:29,649
security posture for IOT realistically

422
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:31,658
there were nine thousand and fifty

423
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:33,428
people nine thousand nine hundred and

424
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:37,630
fifty people that didn't even notice he

425
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:39,059
had done it or potentially in six months

426
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,320
time they're probably going to have

427
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:43,510
Vernor abilities in their router again

428
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,279
and they're not aware that they need to

429
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:50,649
patch it and I'm pretty sure Alexei is

430
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:51,549
not going to do it again so this was

431
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,529
interesting because then we thought

432
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,289
about brick abort and so brick a bot was

433
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:59,919
an another IAT bot that went through and

434
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:02,289
breached devices IOT devices so not as

435
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,770
friendly as Alexi this guy this these

436
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:07,750
people were trying to inflict damage but

437
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:11,110
we sort of looked at the the net effect

438
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:13,840
this had on the IOT world and and

439
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,539
realistically when you know your mom or

440
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,250
dad realized that their routers not

441
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:20,529
working they're most likely going to go

442
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,510
back to JB hi-fi or wherever they bought

443
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,789
it and say you know my routers not

444
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,190
working anymore can you replace it so

445
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:29,080
it's actually the net effect of this is

446
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,169
holding the vendor accountable for bad

447
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,480
security in their device but but this is

448
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:36,220
completely illegal so not going to do

449
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,880
this and don't recommend anyone doing

450
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:46,720
this just sort of doing a an analysis of

451
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:48,279
what's out there so this brings us to

452
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,470
the question of what can we do

453
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:55,210
legally so basically what we've shown is

454
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,510
the mikrotik vigilante break apart show

455
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,679
the consumers aren't practicing good

456
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,529
security hygiene and patching their

457
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,179
devices but what we need to do is

458
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,440
educate consumers and this is an

459
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:12,340
important step to improve the situation

460
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:15,309
so as we said we're protecting ashour so

461
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,049
we're trying to educate people into good

462
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,539
security practice so we decided we

463
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:21,460
developed some advice for general

464
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,420
consumers so we looked at the four

465
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,910
mainstays

466
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,100
an IOT device so when you buy the device

467
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,560
while you're setting it up while you're

468
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:34,030
maintaining and using it and finally

469
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:36,370
when you dispose of the device so buying

470
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,220
the buying stage of an IOT device will

471
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,570
accept before you buy the device so we

472
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,640
recommend people go out there and

473
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,350
research their options using reputable

474
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,140
websites that provide reviews on the

475
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:50,320
device if possible look at cybersecurity

476
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,470
reviews look for companies that offer

477
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,909
firmware and software updates and

478
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,670
identify how when these updates are

479
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,910
provided so as we looked earlier the

480
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:02,260
Google Nest these were these are

481
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:06,280
provided once they're provided they're

482
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:10,270
installed automatically and ruined our

483
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:12,280
live demo but so look at what our data

484
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,280
is collected and stored by the devices

485
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,510
this one's more a personal choice for

486
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,970
individual users but it's about

487
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:21,760
understanding what your device will use

488
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:24,310
so have a look at whether it's whether

489
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,050
your data is encrypted whether it's

490
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:29,320
being handed off to third parties and

491
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:31,060
make an informed decision on what you

492
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,080
would like to do and even see if you can

493
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,669
opt out of the data collection and

494
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,560
finally think about how suitable your

495
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,870
device is for its intended purpose and

496
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,760
be aware of the devices limitations and

497
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,280
unwanted capabilities so this looks at

498
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,080
not going out and buying the biggest and

499
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,790
best device when you only want one of

500
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,409
its functionality because just because

501
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,730
it has ten extra things that you're

502
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:56,260
never going to use this probably just

503
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:58,590
exposes you more the setup stage

504
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,730
obviously while you're setting it up and

505
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,100
first thing we say is don't connect your

506
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,630
devices unless you need to so this looks

507
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,399
at your general consumers who are going

508
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,740
out there and buying a Smart TV

509
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,780
purely because it's their right size and

510
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,460
has a good display on it and they're

511
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,160
using it to maybe pop a few pictures on

512
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,600
in this shot so this this device

513
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,790
probably doesn't need to be connected to

514
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,149
the Internet and by connecting it once

515
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,200
again you're just exposing yourself

516
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:26,010
change the default username and

517
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,160
passwords this is just common ité advice

518
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:35,020
put it on the sum make a secure secure

519
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,280
password and as shown by the Murai they

520
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,080
are the default usernames

521
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,930
words are out there and can be easily

522
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,480
accessible and can be used to attack

523
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,280
your device purchase to secure Wi-Fi

524
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,050
router with robust security and

525
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,970
authentication as we showed with both

526
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:51,730
those two attacks a common point of

527
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,380
attack is the router itself you can even

528
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,090
take this a step further and set up an

529
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,850
additional Wi-Fi network on the router

530
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,830
for IOT devices only this separates it

531
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,260
from your everyday banking and

532
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,330
everything you do ID your network and

533
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,700
finally turn off any functionality

534
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,710
that's not needed this can include

535
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,890
things like cameras and microphones and

536
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,390
even blocking physical ports as we

537
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,670
showed with the Google Nest the

538
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,860
Bluetooth on Bluetooth is on permanently

539
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,330
and that's how we've got in even though

540
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,490
that Bluetooth is only used for the set

541
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:28,449
up next we look at the maintenance stage

542
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:31,150
so reboot devices regularly maybe even

543
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:33,640
at least weekly this is because most

544
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,920
malware on the IOT devices is random run

545
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,450
in memory by rebooting the device you

546
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,470
have a there's a possibility that that

547
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:43,750
will be enough to stop it ensure oh wait

548
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:47,500
IOT devices are up-to-date and security

549
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:50,170
patches are incorporated then to turn

550
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,880
your devices off when not in use so

551
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:55,560
don't just leave them on permanently

552
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,810
similar to computers where you are

553
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,669
reboot them regularly and watch for a

554
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,919
significant increase in monthly internet

555
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:05,680
usage or your bill and if stove art has

556
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,770
become slower inoperable so increases in

557
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,110
your monthly internet usage and as

558
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,400
identify a botnet on your device well if

559
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:16,449
your device is becoming slow and

560
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,060
inoperable can identify malware finally

561
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,500
the disposal stage of an IOT device can

562
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,570
refer to either when you're throwing the

563
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,120
device in the bin or when you're selling

564
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,919
it on so we want people to wipe the

565
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,739
device making sure to erase all their

566
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,150
contents and personal information

567
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,130
perform a factory reset of the device

568
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:36,280
resetting all passwords and settings to

569
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:37,840
default remove memory of the device from

570
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,180
other devices that were connected to it

571
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,129
prevent future pairing so an example of

572
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,130
this is the lifx lights that were thrown

573
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,480
out with the Wi-Fi detail still on them

574
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:49,820
this is just an easy way for people to

575
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:55,130
gain access and remove any removable me

576
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:57,470
that were attached to the device but as

577
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,500
we suggested earlier a big part of the

578
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:02,210
problem as the vendors not having good

579
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:07,270
security on their devices to begin with

580
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:07,270
so what can we do to influence this

581
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,950
first we went out and we had a look at

582
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:16,040
what's been done overseas so the UK the

583
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:23,720
National Cyber Security Center and the

584
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:26,420
Department of Department of digital

585
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,430
culture media and support published this

586
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,590
document called secure by design and

587
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,830
what this is is it's a code of practice

588
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:36,050
on IOT and basically sets thirteen

589
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,120
security guidelines for vendors to our

590
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:42,230
manufacturers to apply to their device

591
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:45,229
before they can sell them similarly in

592
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:48,050
the US late last year two bills got

593
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,780
passed in California called information

594
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:53,810
privacy connected devices these will

595
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,600
become law January 1st 2020 and these

596
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,889
follow a similar thing where

597
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,510
manufacturers which they refer to as

598
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,400
people who either manufacture that

599
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,190
device themselves or contract someone

600
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,230
else to manufacture the device for them

601
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:09,350
have to meet and some security

602
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:12,710
guidelines and includes are they say

603
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,629
reasonable security features if they

604
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:19,760
have any intention to sell their devices

605
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:22,910
in California so what are we doing here

606
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,650
so currently we're working with quite

607
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:28,220
closely with the Department of Home

608
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:30,650
Affairs to work on lifting the security

609
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,480
of the Internet of Things so we're going

610
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,370
to have a rep from Home Affairs here

611
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,460
with us today but unfortunately leading

612
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:40,189
into the election and coming up to

613
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,260
caretaker mode there are limited to what

614
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:45,590
they can say and talk about what they

615
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:49,400
can talk on policy so this involves both

616
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:51,439
the technical and policy approaches and

617
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,270
we'll be working trying to work closely

618
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,890
with industry in the coming months to

619
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:58,220
make sure any approach that we take has

620
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,780
the writing right impact and also

621
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,490
working with our international partners

622
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,460
to make sure that Australia sits on the

623
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,520
same standards

624
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,500
globally there's also the

625
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,010
internet-of-things alliance Australia

626
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,560
there a peak industry body who have been

627
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,540
quite active in the IOT space and they

628
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:21,510
develop some security guidelines as well

629
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:25,530
as some other work into IOT so so in

630
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:27,450
summary IOT is prolific we talked about

631
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,240
some of the areas that covers we looked

632
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,010
at consumer today but our policy

633
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,610
direction will probably go broader than

634
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:38,910
that after a few years it's currently

635
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,229
super easy to attack and we have two

636
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,860
approaches so there are consumer

637
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,600
education piece and vendor policies and

638
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,449
if you want any if you want to reach

639
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,550
back into the ACC or Home Affairs to to

640
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:53,280
talk about the policy pieces that are

641
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:55,240
come up and coming just hit us up at the

642
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,170
break

643
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,170
[Applause]

644
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,990
you
