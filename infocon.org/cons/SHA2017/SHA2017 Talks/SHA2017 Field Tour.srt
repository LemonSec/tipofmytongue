31
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:35,729
let's accelerate it a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here is</font>

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,090

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,610
hardened road you see your head you can

48
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,500
camper vans and caravans mainly intended

49
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,930
for families and disabled a bit away

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,530
from the event itself but still it's a

51
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,870
nice place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay next to the water and</font>

52
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,840
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go up oh there's an island Oh a</font>

53
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,450
wonderful camp over<font color="#CCCCCC"> there probably no</font>

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,150
power there but no network there maybe

55
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,980
if you unless you pull get the cables

56
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:52,200
there yourself but still it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:55,200
way to camp a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few more water bodies this</font>

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,149
is the main camping area that's Lamar

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,299
field<font color="#E5E5E5"> Manning field</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> torvalds field</font>

60
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:05,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">wozniak field Turing field also filled</font>

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:08,790
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> liskov field in the back to the left</font>

62
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">here from the lake is flowers field all</font>

63
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:16,700
named after our great heroes an equal

64
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:19,800
number of men and<font color="#CCCCCC"> women</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and some trends</font>

65
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,929
transgender people so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down</font>

66
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,459
so there will be caravans and camper

67
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,680
vans here on uplink and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to</font>

68
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:36,750
this awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> Island</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really wonder what</font>

69
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:41,220
what happened there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back you'll</font>

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:44,130
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dike already a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit were</font>

71
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:49,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">separated from the main the main canal</font>

72
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:53,400
by the big big huge dike haha where fuel

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,260
meters below sea water level so if the

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,850
dike wasn't here we will we would all be

75
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,120
swimming it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be a water camp</font>

76
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:05,340
instead of a hacker camp I look back at

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:09,000
uplink beyond uplink and on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backside</font>

78
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be the logistics parking area where</font>

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,329
we dump our stuff so you can have an

80
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,760
awesome event so the cross road ahead is

81
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the backbone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Boulevard who comes up with</font>

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,320
these names anyway it's it's awesome to

83
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,979
have hacker and names at your hacker

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,090
camp for all your streets and pass all

85
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,090
the fields have their name

86
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:36,279
it's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beautiful sunny day here</font>

87
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,629
I hope we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same weather</font>

88
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:42,399
during the event bit warmer even perhaps

89
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:49,929
so we can all go swimming and boating

90
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:54,459
and doing stuff with LEDs so a bit more

91
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:57,388
coming up on backbone and the squiggly

92
00:04:54,459 --> 00:05:01,059
path in front of us is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the South drunk</font>

93
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:03,099
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a North drunk I believe</font>

94
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:06,610
yeah there's a North drunk as well but

95
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:10,149
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is South drunk coming up on Lamar</font>

102
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:31,179
coming here somewhere around well I

103
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,699
don't know somewhere between these yeah

104
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:35,948
the concrete patch here in the middle

105
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:41,289
that's where the arcade is probably

106
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:45,129
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be or maybe one further down so</font>

107
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:48,549
let's go up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit we're still floating</font>

will be a lot more toilets and showers

114
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:10,779
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the event we're just floating</font>

115
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:14,469
progressively down the down the shaft

116

126
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,240
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 hackers the the field can</font>

127
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:54,730
accommodate six thousand with our

128
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,680
camping style it probably could

129
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:01,520
accommodate 10 times more if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were a</font>

130
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,230
bit more compact but I it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

131
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,419

195
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice because all these fields of the</font>

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:27,300
north drunker are hidden away behind the

197
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:31,060
trees and it makes it makes it a nice

199
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:37,270
quiet so let's see where we are right

200
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:42,219
now we're progressing down and we're

201

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,910
if you need a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of peace and quiet</font>

204
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:54,150
this is the place where you want to be

205
00:10:50,910 --> 00:11:00,930
the wooden structure in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back is</font>

206
00:10:54,150 --> 00:11:04,110
toilets and showers for this field and

207
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:07,649
beyond that is bull filled with the

208
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:10,080
family village so if you bring kids to

209
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:13,080
shower they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be plenty for you to do</font>

210
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,820
with your children at the family village

outdoor stuff a lot of hackery stuff

213
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,040
it's it's it's nice it's I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

214
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,839
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plans they have I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

215
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,589
spoil them because I want you to be

216
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,570
surprised it's nice in the in the rear

217
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:33,390
behind the trees to the roundish area

218
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:37,740

219
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,630
the last field on our list I think it's

220
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,170
another camping area not sure at the

221
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:46,730
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's probably the field</font>

222
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:52,170
furthest away from well<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything we have</font>

223
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:56,790
at it'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the the most rustic</font>

224
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:59,699
feel so probably no power probably no no

225
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:03,209
anything but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to camp like</font>

226
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:09,930
that you can a nice and quiet field and

227
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:12,060

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard road with the lounge area just</font>

231
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,670

234
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,160
