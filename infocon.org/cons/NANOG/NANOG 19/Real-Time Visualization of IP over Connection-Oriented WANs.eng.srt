we'd be happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come out and install it</font>

45

47

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,649
the sense that there's switched media

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,389
it using that also there's a whole

series of protocols that have the same

screams into SB seeds and it appeared

that the protocols were such that if

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,849
what we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a global real-time</font>

from the magic testbed which doesn't

was the snapshot like as not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

created this is actually just a sequence

of just files but it was a snapshot of

ten minutes or sort of magic test bed

97
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,608
and you can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity in a</font>

because the visualization application

can run as a typical run as an athlete

I didn't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> run Java doc over the</font>

201
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,580
two major parts there's this data

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:17,669
then creates the realization and I just

210
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,859
said that so the collection analysis

211

subsystem extract data from the network

212
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,909
using SNMP our objective was to be able

00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">to if you will walk into a network with</font>

just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and plug it in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not have</font>

215
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,688
to worry about instrumenting the network

or or caffeine ocular lines and<font color="#E5E5E5"> chucking</font>

217
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,969

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,469
view one part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network that way</font>

219
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,000

devices where they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> their stays up</font>

223
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:49,620
our and then compile all that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,390
software and autodiscover topology of

the network you give it the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

226
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,750
node and you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a lots of SNMP</font>

227
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,020
community names and it goes off and

searches as far as wide as a candle

you can generate consumers visualization

to deploy this in some larger networks

that's one of the reasons I'm here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:30,319
and I'll talking about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment so um I</font>

345
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,730
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done well here also not</font>

346
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:33,529
speaking of learning how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

347

if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use URL so what's going on</font>

349
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:44,540
oh no no I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to run this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop I'm not sorry it's not</font>

that our trust is networking stuffing

352
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,579
everything better and actually run a

353
00:13:50,569 --> 00:14:00,019
little bit better / / laptop sucks but

354
00:13:52,579 --> 00:14:04,008
this is the current current tool running

355
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:07,730
as an application<font color="#E5E5E5"> just running off GDK</font>

356

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> University campus last week and as</font>

360
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,529
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's all the</font>

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:28,910
can click on a switch and get some

information about that switch to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

364
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,910
examples you can extract it and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

365
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,529
there's other information you might want

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,730
to do it now that you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

367
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:38,689
of getting the information out of the

switch and into the display application

369
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">brig and this is all pre-recorded</font>

370
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:48,019
pre-recorded data and I will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

371
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,139
wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my laptop to crash here for a</font>

372
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,910
few minutes welcome I was hoping by

373
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:56,630
shutting down power point I can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

374
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:58,829
members<font color="#CCCCCC"> a script dude and so we call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

375
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,650
the color encoded with

00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,720
virtual circuits in this particular

377
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:07,110
example we currently have it set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

378
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,370
color encoded by signaling type and so

379
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other ones there</font>

380
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,490
are you and I is have to do for system

381
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,770
switches and for historical reasons

382
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:18,150
they're still stands right in there that

383
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:20,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">the green lines you know it runs forever</font>

384
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,430
you don't need to configure it so neat

385
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:28,770
solution and then the blue lines happen

386
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:30,449
to be signaling signaling channels where

387
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,130
the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves so here we have</font>

388
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,700
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about port where we actually</font>

389
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:39,020
create a graph over time of the

390
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:41,220
utilization of that port um you can

391
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,870
click on a VC and gain the information

392
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,080
about that bc we have to know how long

393
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:52,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">this DC was up and what sort of traffic</font>

394
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:54,540
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> clothed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in passing and you can drag</font>

395
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:59,760
these things around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth also</font>

396
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:01,800
you can control I guess I go up two runs

397
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,240
on your web browser does it really build

398
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,790
on the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your web browser it</font>

399
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,690

400
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,160
keep other windows we can control even

401
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,370
turn on an offer example you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the onion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IBC's and see what's</font>

403
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:23,610
left in terms of spans and similarly

404
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:29,220
happen to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary things we also</font>

405
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,570
can color in code VCS by age and about

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only interesting thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

407
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,790
is that I guess not too surprising that

408
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,940
VCS are sort of bimodal either they've

409
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:43,329
been up all day long or in this case for

410
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:47,319
days or or they've been up for just a

411
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sandra yeah that's an artifact of what</font>

412
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:51,790
part of I p stack is driving those three

413
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,139
seasons on the traffic cabinets and some

414
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,469
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like their resembles up a</font>

415
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:59,920
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we can also encode by data</font>

416
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,809

the percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the bandwidth that's</font>

418
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:06,490
totally utilized and as you can see

419
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,110
basically the same time going to utilize

420
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,630
so if everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regret</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let me</font>

421
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:16,688
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if you have the technology along as</font>

well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a lot of other points</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there so</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick overview of the tool or</font>

424
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,559
as I said you can drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grab these</font>

425
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,460
these nodes around and save the

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,080
configuration information and reload it

427
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,700
and then have all the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> animations</font>

428
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:39,928
use that same configuration not be

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,929
further harder point again

430
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:58,840
so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we've been sighted set</font>

431
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,200
of technologies looking for water sighs

432
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,250

provide us with a better definition as I

said we think managing a collection of

switch circuits and forwarding traffic

489

over them there's a really general

problem IP over ATM has a collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

497
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,960
could argue that their mobile IP tunnels

are another class of a switch connection

499

over which IP protocols have to forward

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,540
particularly the anomalous cases well in

577
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,220
wide area networks and that's part of

578
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,510
what we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive that is at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

579
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,420
a point our at son

580
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,190
this point to some protocol design

581
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,500
techniques that either<font color="#E5E5E5"> are bad or could</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> improved appointment so that let me</font>

583
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,650
take any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions if there's the</font>

584
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:00,570
questions and relatives just<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

585
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:04,290
schedule for<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you intend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to release</font>

586
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:08,460
the full radical are you going to

587
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:10,680
release<font color="#E5E5E5"> it early a tomato my answers are</font>

588
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,300
sending email and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to look</font>

589
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,980
at the stuff because we've all made a

590
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,570
commitment to loosen the grip<font color="#CCCCCC"> loose tell</font>

591
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,120
license we're happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it available</font>

592
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to anybody if you want to run it we're</font>

593
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to come help you run it ultimately</font>

594
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,030
we're going to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of money and</font>

595
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">contract in December by which time</font>

596
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've got to have a bundle of them and</font>

597
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:30,690
the week so the South works you know

598
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web pages the stuff works as</font>

599
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,870
a bit to a larger network will probably

600
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,160
find something you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

601
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,620
differently probably a little bit of

602
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,720
performance optimization<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like if you</font>

603
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">want the copies of the stuff send us</font>

604
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,550
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and down how about concurrent</font>

605
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,909
visualization of the real-time

606
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:51,840
statistics multiple users accessing yeah

607
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:54,930
are the collection and an analysis

608
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,159
subsystem can support multiple users and

609
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,120
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have that mechanism there</font>

610
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,160
where the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens when</font>

611
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">a browser comes up is it dumps the</font>

00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,120
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> model to the robbers you cannot</font>

613
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,379
multi probably not I don't claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

614
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've had one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two or three hundred</font>

615
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,550
simultaneous<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay design yep that's the</font>

616
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,550
intent and it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>
