1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,810
the thing that I put a large part of my

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,380
time into educator has been the kind of

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,440
metrics working group this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a group</font>

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,230
which is trying to push<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that</font>

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,060
measurements are important and to get

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,920
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested and involved in</font>

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,759
doing them and to look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,760
interesting problems that turns up it's

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,470
a an<font color="#E5E5E5"> openwork imperative to smaller</font>

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,289
linking group which is fairly tightly

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,570
focused and trying to produce useful

12
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:36,510
results in a fairly short time we have

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,969
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-chairs from industry soon moon</font>

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,160
from sprint labs breath watching from

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,890
above met so what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this morning is the metrics working</font>

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,750
group and what it's all about the

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,459
measurement the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FAQ which is a document</font>

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the group is produced which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,350
really like some feedback on I'm going

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a quick look at some common</font>

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,600
metrics and how they're defined then

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll give it into the availability rat</font>

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,739
hole that is everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about it</font>

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">but nobody really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cares too much about</font>

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,659
what it means so we're going to try a

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,470
definition on you and six of feedback

28
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:19,799
the Mystics working group has two main

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,289
goals one is education so we've produced

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,340
any thank you which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> background</font>

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,080
document which has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of material</font>

32
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,450
relating to measurement which is

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,210
collected together for people who are

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,840
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll going through that</font>

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more detail in a moment and</font>

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main part of the working groups</font>

37
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,490
activities to work through and define

38
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,579
metrics particularly metrics for new and

39
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,619
emerging services we haven't actually

40
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,750
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> any bounds as to what they might be</font>

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,149
but quality of services<font color="#E5E5E5"> one sort of</font>

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,030
obvious area if only<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could all agree</font>

43
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,070
on what that means but the outcome from

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,140
all of this should be a service

45
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,929
measurement tool kit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a list of</font>

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,630
things which we think people really

47
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,679
should be measuring and recommended good

48
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,658
ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font>

49
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,219
and given that we can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with such</font>

50
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:14,319
a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we'd like to encourage</font>

51
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,120
people to implement that and to

52
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,988
generally coordinate that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

53
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,260
activity and the third goal is to

54
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:25,840
produce a revised version of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gators</font>

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,939
document on measurement requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,120
hardware and software vendors this has

57
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,400
been around for these two years it's

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,000
pitched<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's customers that is for</font>

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,030
people who buy networking hardware and

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,220
it's been as it stands at the moment on

61
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,359
the k2 website it's aimed at some users

62
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,239
but there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very little response</font>

63
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:51,909
from the user community so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage</font>

64
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,200
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read that and give us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

65
00:02:51,909 --> 00:03:00,189
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there now what's in the FAQ</font>

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,719
well its aims at users that is corporate

67
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,578
users who are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run their</font>

68
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,638
networks who are dealing with providers

69
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:09,430
makes you guys so that they will

70
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,530
understand how<font color="#CCCCCC"> services can should be</font>

71
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:16,180
defined what kinds of things are asking

72
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:19,540
for it goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all friends I</font>

73
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,669
need to point out this slide there's 20

74
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes worth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jessica</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this slide so</font>

75
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,729
we're really just going to go quickly

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the headings and that'll be true</font>

77
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:29,889
for the next slide as well there are

78
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">life on fictions covering generally</font>

79
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:35,019
accepted terms so that we all use the

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,959
same vocabulary we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're</font>

81
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,759
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

discussion on different musical topics

83

active versus passive when is it better

84
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,099
to use one or the other what are the

85
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:50,139
advantages and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> point versus many how</font>

86
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,048
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get on measuring inside a network</font>

87
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:55,509
as compared to out at the edges which is

88
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:58,090
better what are their advantages one way

89
00:03:55,509 --> 00:04:00,548
or the other what should you be doing on

90
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,280
your particular network issues about

91
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:06,729
sampling and that's that's a big area

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,170
with there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much published and</font>

93
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:12,170
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of good understanding that's</font>

94
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,780
which is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go away we all the</font>

95
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,959
tribe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and harder on records and on the</font>

96
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:22,430
statistics front again there's a lot of

97
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:25,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of farms about statistics are</font>

98
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with which in principle</font>

99
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,510
I'm very simple but they're not well

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,900
understood so there's a lot of

101
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,630
background on that the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

102
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,969
material in the year thank you goes into

103
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,250
a fairly detailed description of the

104
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,860
common metrics these are the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

105
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,540
everybody should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be measuring latency</font>

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,979
a moment it keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up in service</font>

110
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,840
specifications and things like that

111
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:04,430
endless a section on common measurement

112
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:08,590
tools which is a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of super condensed</font>

version of the k'da tools taxonomy page

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:15,289
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through the tools for measuring</font>

115
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the common metrics and the last thing</font>

116
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:20,510
which are scheduled up now there is a

117
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling i'll feature which provides some</font>

118
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:25,909
ideas which you can use well which

119
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:31,039
customers can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compare service</font>

120
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:32,690
offerings<font color="#E5E5E5"> from different providers so</font>

121
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,060
there it comes a better the interesting

122
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:38,630
part talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how do we specify</font>

123
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,240
network service now there's quite a few

124
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,490
providers big providers and small

125
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,430
providers who publish service level

126
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,680
agreements of width listed a few of

127
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,250
those and<font color="#CCCCCC"> these describe the services</font>

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,970
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're offering to customers at</font>

129
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,940
this point if<font color="#E5E5E5"> their line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

130
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,130
hot potato and

131
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,469
people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push me away</font>

132
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">from talking about them so I'm not going</font>

133
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about service level agreements</font>

134
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,690
I'm talking about service specifications

135
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:13,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to say I'm not interested in the</font>

136
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,860
contractual part of service level

137
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,349
agreements what happens if the service

138
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,480
level isn't men that kind of stuff I'm

139
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">only interested in trying to specify</font>

140
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,390
exactly what services should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and from</font>

141
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">your point of view that's what you</font>

142
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:32,409
should be interested too interested in

143
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,150
to the first sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really obvious</font>

144
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,880
thing about this as you read the service

145
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,799
definitions on the web is that the

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,969
matrix which they use to define the

147
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,640
services are often poorly defined there

148
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,850
are words like latency and availability

149
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,370
again I used and nobody really<font color="#CCCCCC"> says</font>

150
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly well not nobody but very often</font>

151
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,270
people don't say what they mean so the

152
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,760
illustrators will look at a typical

153
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,969
example and I picked this one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,750
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good example concisely put easy to</font>

155
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:08,440
understand these are from<font color="#CCCCCC"> you units and</font>

156
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:11,770
SLA page units is that the network

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,680
quality they provide an average monthly

158
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:17,140
location of no more than 85 million

159
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,720
atoms for a round trip with in units

milliseconds between new york and london

162
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,610
where which is fine they've taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

163
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,410
trouble to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it clear that they are</font>

164
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,700
only promising things within their own

165
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:36,250
linguist they don't particularly define

166
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,020
latency and they don't really tell you

167
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,440
what they mean by average monthly

168
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,270
latencies so they don't tell you things

169
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">like how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> often do they test the matrix</font>

how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do that test things like</font>

171
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,200
that and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

172
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,220
bit surprising is that they say nothing

173
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,830
at all about packet loss and some of the

174
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,560
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who put</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">service level specifications on the web</font>

176
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,460
do say things about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> commotion going on</font>

177
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,610
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the second part of the unit</font>

178
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:12,299
service speak talks about service

179
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,800
quality and they say that their service

180
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,260
provides one hundred percent of

181
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,400
availability over the unit backbone and

182
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:22,289
that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that connects to you but</font>

183
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,440
they also say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do the stuff</font>

184
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,450
called scheduled maintenance and that

185
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
takes place<font color="#E5E5E5"> every now and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but they</font>

186
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,010
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you whether or not the</font>

187
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,630
central maintenance time is part if

188
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,809
included<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hundred percent</font>

189
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:39,419
availability so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of a</font>

190
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,619
puzzle and it leaves wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> open the</font>

191
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:46,920
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what do they really</font>

192
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:48,960
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by availability but it's anger on</font>

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,670
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole thing is given that</font>

194
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,680
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to specify the service</font>

195
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're offering how are you going</font>

196
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,609
to measure and how are your customers to

197
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,920
go to know that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting what</font>

198
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:02,580
they're paying for well one of the

199
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:06,569
things which a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of providers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to</font>

200
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,220
publish pages on the web giving status

201
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,790
reports on how their network is doing

202
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:15,630
Jim Donelon ran an email thread on the

203
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,069
nanog list for quite some time and that

204
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,610
produced a list of about thirteen

205
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,970
different providers who published status

206
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:28,590
and pages and in the FAQ those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

207
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:30,570
listed with their URLs when we look at

208
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,500
those pages the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of detail which</font>

209
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,540
they give varies<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot some of them are</font>

210
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,980
simple Network Status pages they tell

211
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,410
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the current outages they tell</font>

212
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,870
you about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current problems others</font>

213
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,390
give you quite detailed statistics about

214
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:49,080
what's happening they give you matrices

215
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,260
showing what the transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans are from</font>

216
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,370
point to point within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network some</font>

217
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,270
of them just give you a monthly

218
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:00,840
percentage which is the same sort of

219
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:04,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">information but compressed into one or</font>

220
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,640
two numbers so and it's very interesting

221
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,860
to look at

222
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,410
at the different provider status pages

223
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,650
and again there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of half a dozen</font>

224
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:19,050
URLs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> vote in the measurement in thank</font>

225
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">you but that's all very well and intends</font>

226
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,130
on home being publicity about how good

227
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,050
your network is but it doesn't say very

228
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,540
much to your customer about what sort of

229
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,199
performance the customer expects from

230
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,500
their connection through your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so</font>

231
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,300
for that customers really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to make</font>

232
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,310
their own measurements and I'll come

233
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,199
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little later on and give you an</font>

234
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,819
example of the kinds of things which can

235
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,520
be done when it all over there looking

236
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">at common metrics well throughput and</font>

237
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,840
utilization lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people do that</font>

238
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straightforward you can't</font>

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,720
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> H&M p agent in it and there are tools</font>

241
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:02,609
like mr<font color="#E5E5E5"> cg so that you can collect</font>

242
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,230
current throughput from your the

243
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,200
different interfaces and<font color="#E5E5E5"> plot them</font>

244
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,530
nicely with their back DG when it comes

245
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,120
to latency the as it's used in the

246
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,240
service specifications that usually

247
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,100
means round trip time and most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

248
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,510
just measure it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing which of</font>

249
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,390
course gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a packet loss</font>

250
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,790
measurements as well well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to</font>

251
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,430
availability there really isn't a

252
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,069
definition so the working group has come

253
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,430
up with one which<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to try on you</font>

254
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:34,920
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just remind you this is a kid</font>

255
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:38,880
to define it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we really need</font>

256
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,540
completely so we say there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no such</font>

257
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,510
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a single availability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measure</font>

258
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,510
as a customer what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is to</font>

259
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,310
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is your view of it</font>

260
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,439
you want what is it that's important to

261
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,079
you so we define three levels of

262
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,720
availability network availability which

263
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,420
means you can see in packets to the

264
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet from your place and get some</font>

265
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of response host availability means</font>

266
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,219
that you can get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets to some</font>

267
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,370
particular host which is important to

268
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,029
you and again give proper response

269
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:17,100
and soon as available about service

270
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:19,640
availability means being able to send

271
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets for some particular service</font>

272
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,410
and if the right response so as a

273
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,230
customer when you're thinking about what

274
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want you need to say well I need to</font>

275
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,940
be able to get a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> within such a</font>

276
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,890
such a time for pages from such a web

277
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:41,670
server or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that for</font>

278
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:46,020
measuring it there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much to</font>

279
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,670
add to that you've started from the top

280
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,949
going down it all as well of course

281
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:53,790
you're probably not too worried about

282
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,010
that but and if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

283
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,170
it's going then you need its web server

284
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,029
then you need to download test pages

285
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:04,740
from time to time and measure how long

286
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:06,630
it takes to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them back if you lose</font>

287
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,550
service available if you then you

288
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,529
probably the next thing you do is to

289
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,660
test to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see whether the host is</font>

290
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,060
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you do that by paying the</font>

291
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,829
tagatose which verifies that you have

292
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,510
connectivity to it on response to ICMP

293
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:24,900
and if that fails then the question is

294
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,610
well do you have network availability so

295
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,050
you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> running dresser out and see</font>

296
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:34,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">how far into the network with make again</font>

297
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:37,050
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just search the basic idea when</font>

298
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,140
it comes to doing this what the FAQ

299
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,449
suggests is that as a customer you need

300
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,640
to sit down with your provider and work

301
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,790
through what the service is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going</font>

302
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,410
to be and what both sides mean by

303
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,079
availability so you have to decide

304
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">between it what services are important</font>

305
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,370
and what sort of performance level in

306
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:02,390
terms of latency and packet loss

307
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,390
disciple is acceptable so

308
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:09,229
I sign it be realistic we can't promise

309
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,020
water we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can deliver although there's</font>

310
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:15,140
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> point which is with making their</font>

311
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,510
some packet loss is inevitable<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCP after</font>

312
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:20,510
all relies on packet loss to detect

313
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,610
congestion so it's quite unrealistic for

314
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:27,170
a customer to suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they might</font>

315
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:28,670
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and said packet loss given</font>

316
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:33,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that both sides are working together</font>

317
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:35,180
properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this then both sides need to</font>

318
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,070
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what kind of measurements</font>

319
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,069
we're going to make to verify that it's

320
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really working and they need to make</font>

321
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">some measurements early on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

322
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:48,649
everything's working properly to use as

323
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,300
a baseline so later on so an example of

324
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:53,779
the kind of measurements which you can

325
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,870
make here is a lot errors which I

326
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:59,779
managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Friday this is</font>

327
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,459
totally passive measurements looking at

328
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:05,270
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the traffic coming and going</font>

329
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:08,029
through the commercial commodity

331

332
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,620
traffic from UCSD into the internet and

333
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,630
out of that I've picked traffic that

334
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,480
comes and goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and from a couple of</font>

00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:35,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">around 100</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> milliseconds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

341
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,520
about 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> milliseconds and you can see</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gap of wheeler to the left of the</font>

middle layer where service disappeared

344
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:46,339
completely for about three hours I think

345
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,430
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a definite must of network</font>

particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> well with the loss</font>

358
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,120

359
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:31,430
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be explained</font>

360
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:35,270
it's a very early measurement from an

361
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:38,329
intermittent meter so the wound up the

362
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:41,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">young midgets working group has got</font>

363
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:44,120
started as a fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> small group we've</font>

364
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,740
produced the measurement faq providing

365
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,130
background material on a lot of

366
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,290
measurement products among which we've

367
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:55,220
produced a definition of service

368
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:57,230
availability we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need some</font>

369
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,760
feedback from particularly different

370
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:03,140
providers who simulator word surely have

371
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,910
it with the secretary<font color="#CCCCCC"> which that should</font>

372
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,670
have customers beating on them saying

373
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:10,370
this is what we want to do so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

374
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:16,610
try and ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what we've got this</font>

the material impact written the draft
