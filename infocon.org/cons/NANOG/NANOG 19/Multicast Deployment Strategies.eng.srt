00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,529
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of happy that could be reporting</font>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,919
that what I'm going to do is give you a

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,150
brief history is only difference review

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problem that multicast this time</font>

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">song makes you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about 12 seconds a</font>

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,500
brief history of what went on where

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,240
we're at and then what's going on now

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">where were you what's new and I'll take</font>

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,180
a little bit about one case study that I

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,979
happened to get some slides more which

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the supreme and I have a few conclusions</font>

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,230
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide</font>

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,910
start there so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multicast</font>

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,710
thing right the idea was you're going to

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,450
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> one one copy of packing on any</font>

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,540
Lincoln<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's if it's a nice I got these</font>

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,950
cool information see<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I don't know how</font>

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,269
to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I can feel pretty good</font>

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,690
sometimes as long as they're not

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,219
completely gratuitous but the point is

21
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,989
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to put one cup one copy</font>

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,300
of the packet on every link and so you

23
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,578
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimize a lot of different things</font>

24
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,930
that way um so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was two things</font>

25
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">about multi guess people were saying</font>

26
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,170
wearing the benefit so that one is

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,519
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

28
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,109
could at get been with savings of a

29
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,609
multicast the other one was that there

30
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,050
was a service model that allows people

31
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,799
to write new and interesting

32
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,929
applications so this was the multicast

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,460
story that we were working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

34
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,200
last five to seven years I'd say so what

35
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,710
we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was we wanted to</font>

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,600
be able to scale bandwidth without

37
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,490
accumulating a lot of state which was

38
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,960
always a problem because you have this

39
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you had this cross product for the</font>

40
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,899
number of sources x number of groups and

41
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,990
that was something that scary people off

42
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,210
quite a good because these are all /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

43
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,949

44
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">always the issue of how you to sign</font>

45
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">McCloskey address space because there is</font>

46
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that much of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so maybe to aggregate it</font>

47
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,070
when posting how to do that and maybe a

48
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,429
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it dynamically</font>

49
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,869
to peruse it socialism a very

50
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,220
intelligent so that it does were kind of

51
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,120
that issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are working around now oh</font>

52
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,700
so here's a brief history of the

53
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,770
multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> University very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brief I just</font>

54
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,229
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flow of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is so that</font>

55
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can put some context here so when we</font>

56
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,590
get to what's new you'll know why it's

57
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,970
new and not wife's old but ok so look a

58
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,360
little bit of history where we are now

59
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:14,220
on similar problems consequences so is a

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,470
quote from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> movie so we have</font>

61
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,590
the emblem how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people had embalmed</font>

62
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,480
tunnels dmdd MIT tunnels and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

63
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,110
what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about but you got a couple</font>

64
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,579
of few quite a few really really bright

65
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,920
and productive people and you get this

66
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,400
stuff right you get dark net and get DVM

67
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,450
RPM and being white<font color="#E5E5E5"> boarding and now to</font>

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,860
this day I don't think there's something

69
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,869
better than that out there for

70
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,030
multimedia conferencing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really</font>

71
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,570
impressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so in these things all</font>

72
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">evolved but really what was underlying</font>

73
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,549
all this when I came along was on the

74
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,930
BBM RPM bone and this is this virtual

75
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,660
tunnel thing many of you guys had

76
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,970
connections and you know you don't rip

77
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,070
like rallying because of the first

78
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,630
emerald geez<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know Bill many can you</font>

79
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,980
correct me i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person Matthews</font>

80
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:04,200
were really serve derived from routing

<font color="#CCCCCC">EST Rockies and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was flooding frame</font>

83
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,260
me just last the package every where and

84
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,090
when there's no receivers at the end of

85
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,768
one of these things that that router

86
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,900
sends back up police don't blessing

87
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:19,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">tactics here and so there was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Marathi</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very popular but what was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us well first off you</font>

90
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,510
didn't have anything like you know you

91
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,959
have it you had a really pretty large

92
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,280
tunnel infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think I my</font>

95
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,829

showed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tunnels were sort of</font>

98
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,550
everywhere I think my letter told me

99
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,620
once the thermal

100
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:46,070
100 tunnel is crossing the fix or that

101
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,740
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduced that on the multicast</font>

102
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,940
benefit and when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was flooded</font>

103
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,260
frameless people didn't want because

110
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,820
and there were policy issues and then

111
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,059
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address allocation problems we</font>

112
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:11,390
never really solved that we had a

<font color="#E5E5E5">program cholesky r or s dr sdn SDR and</font>

114
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,359
then you have this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Malik working group</font>

115
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,880
that we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really solved a address</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">assignment problem for multicast at</font>

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,130
least up to this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and that was</font>

118
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,880
because that multicast address space is

119
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:29,960
too small to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> administered via</font>

121
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,700
stuff is in the past more or less and

122
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,040
today what we're doing as for routing

123
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,360
everybody most people lecturing on multi

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,370
protocol bgp and there's several

125
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,190
interoperable implementations amount out

126
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,770
there for tree building<font color="#CCCCCC"> according to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

127
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,700
multicast RQ routing and porting are

128
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,080
done by two different protocols we use

129
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,390
almost everybody's using pins bars which

130
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,340
used to be RFC 2362 but now is

131
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,250
completely confused and as being

132
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,799
rewritten so hopefully we'll get

133
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,690
something a little bit more on staying

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,190
out of that resource discovery there's a

135
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,940
protocol called<font color="#CCCCCC"> chemist EP that was</font>

136
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,110
built about two years ago and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

147
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,680

148
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,290
statically assigned to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> once or</font>

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,200
nonetheless 24 according on Anna

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,700
management of multicast networks is it

<font color="#CCCCCC">and those conductors is one thing come</font>

152
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,420
to my own will you know everybody's

153
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,780
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the state of</font>

154
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world now what's interesting about</font>

155
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,429
Tim<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart mode which everybody's running</font>

156
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,050
now is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> last sub bullet there which</font>

157
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,730
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what's what happens when I</font>

158
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,660
guess I have another animation by the

159
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,070
way I don't know how to make these

160
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are how to make them on an innate</font>

161
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,159
or anything but so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

162
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,109
thing so PMS is not share trees so what

163
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,850
happens is when you get a receiver like

164
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:14,770
down here at the but generally system

165
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get this receiver push on</font>

166
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,710
the top well that's nice eliminate the

167
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,910
target meanness um so when you get a

168
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,739
receiver down here what happens is the

169
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,480
receiver sends a what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> called an</font>

170
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,770
eschatology joint or two sources are

171
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,390
times<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it what's called the rpe</font>

172
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,650
because it really doesn't know the

173
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,690
source at this time that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

174
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't know the source just wants</font>

175
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,020
to join a group and what happens is the

176
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,820
RP bill to share tree down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

177
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,260
there's what's called star comedy state

178
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,800
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of aggregating all the</font>

179
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,289
sources in the star that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a benefit</font>

180
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,150
when the protocol was designed and then

181
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,430
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> a source comes up the way sources</font>

182
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,780
work is on they do what's called

183
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,600
registering for this thing is an

184
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,890
encapsulated multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> activist</font>

185
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,410
encapsulated in what's called a

186
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,659
registered back you need just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the RP</font>

187
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,960
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPX wasn't on the share tree</font>

188
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,970
like that and then one that is the other

189
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,510
thing if you type the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heads humans to</font>

190
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,850
get emanates unexpected animation anyway

191
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,680
what happens is now now our data packet

192
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,120
came down and that last<font color="#E5E5E5"> out router here</font>

193
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,410
can say hey I know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source of</font>

194
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,560
this thing is because it saw the data

195
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:24,130
packet it's over here and what can

196
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,130
happen is<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh oh I think when they did</font>

197
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,810
was I went one too many okay so here's

198
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,860
what the data packet comes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

199
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,390
see the source now and now oh this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

200
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,980
right here was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just that the RP would</font>

201
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,479
like to have a native path you don't end

202
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,190
capsule

203
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,710
whole time so it's making a native that

204
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,360
back to the factory source enough very

205
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,440
nice for now packets low multicast

206
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,600
encapsulated that's all nice and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

207
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,180
is the way the data flows right now now

208
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,100
the RP will also tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> their people also</font>

209
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,690
tells us to stop sending registers when

210
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,810
it sees<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative packets so that's nice</font>

211
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:01,230
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now what happens is traffic</font>

212
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,910
plugs this way down the down down the

213
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">share tree and now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop router</font>

214
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,450
can see where the sources like this

215
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,980
router right here towards the receiver

216
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they you</font>

217
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,820
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind pence first know</font>

218
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,040
does this normal operation so what it

219
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,510
can do is it can join back to the

220
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,550
sorcery which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is right here because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

221
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,320
source got back to the source string so

222
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,840
what it does is in the join that way and

223
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,820
it creates best commenting state along

224
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,250
here which was the state people were

225
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,780
worried about just that's kind of the

226
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,370
cross product of two<font color="#E5E5E5"> slashes 32 and</font>

227
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,159
trafficking now flowing in that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> Owen</font>

228
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,590
and this sort of superfluous but this

229
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,478
router can send up on what's called a

230
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">Escom grp bit prune to shut off the</font>

231
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">ferry personal data can be both ways as</font>

232
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,189
possible so that's on I ok so now this

233
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">is gratuitous animation but the bottom</font>

234
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,370
line is this guy said ask comments he

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">join here and got data to flow this way</font>

236
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:56,430
once he saw the sources ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

237
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,680
question you might want to ask you such

238
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,089
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in cary and all you wanted</font>

239
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,729
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is get that last step where you</font>

240
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,350
had a source tree from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source of the</font>

241
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,800
receiver you might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that in</font>

242
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,060
a little bit more efficient and easy way

243
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
if for example there's a well-known

244
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,290
source like a broadcast television

245
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,089
station or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

246
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,920
really you know came to mind as well

247
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,140
what if the receiver can just tell the

248
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,819
first hop router is designated router if

249
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">there where the source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the group</font>

250
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,640
wasn't could just send them you know the

251
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">last thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did you just send a mess</font>

252
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">ecology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joined wall send out that I I</font>

253
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,920
can t be<font color="#E5E5E5"> three which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the protocol</font>

254
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,680
that hosts uses to signal if you will

255
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,329
the horse up router can specify that so

256
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,550
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new protocol so just hold on to</font>

257
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,110
that for a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that whole</font>

258
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,279
thing with yourself is actually in the

259
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,089
interred in<font color="#E5E5E5"> tirado main case so that's</font>

260
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,220
happens inside and enterprise but what

261
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:50,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the interdomain case</font>

262
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,209
as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this thing called ms.vp</font>

263
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and MSD fees real simple protocol all it</font>

264
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:58,479
does is it sends around if a domain is a

265
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,490
source it just sends a packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so say I</font>

266
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,920
have the source in this group and what

267
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,779
so here's the example this receiver up

268
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,910
here just came up in this thing right

269
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,829
here is that whole can spar snowed

270
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,149
interaction where it built the share

271
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,829
tree okay and that's what the thing has

272
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:13,930
been sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's a receiver</font>

273
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:15,998
now someday some a source comes up down

274
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,769
here in some domain well the source is

275
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:20,529
going to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> ms.vp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source active</font>

276
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:23,529
messages towards that towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain</font>

277
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:27,009
without where the hot receiver is

278
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:30,189
actually fled them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of this funny</font>

279
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:31,959
fashion towards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards and they</font>

280
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:33,699
will wind up going towards the receiver

281
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">by me now with what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this means is that</font>

282
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,899
the receiver can now just send an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eskimo</font>

283
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">G joined back to the source just like</font>

284
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,290
them squares<font color="#E5E5E5"> no that's right again the</font>

285
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,850
thing to notice here for your own

286
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,259
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that again we're</font>

287
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,759
just trying to join directly to the

288
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:47,980
source none<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this other machinery all</font>

289
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,740
we're trying to do is join a sorcery so

290
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,019
what happens is well then data starts

291
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,610
flowing this way through the RP but now

292
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,230
at the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop router which is not</font>

293
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,970
being shown on here but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like last</font>

294
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,800
time it sees the data and they can

295
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,309
switch to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source got three shuttles</font>

296
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it'll send on a technology join and</font>

297
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:08,259
that path might cut off<font color="#CCCCCC"> that party or</font>

298
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">may not close through it at the bottom</font>

299
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,279
line hairs you went to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

300
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:14,709
just to get how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just to get on</font>

301
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,290
the leaf from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sorcerer and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

302
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:19,540
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know broadcast source and</font>

303
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,339
somebody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some content aggregators</font>

304
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,980
network and you wind up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a source</font>

305
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:25,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">team and again I receiver didn't know</font>

306
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,889
where the source was right and that's

307
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,200
what the RP and all this mechanism is

308
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,019
for

309
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,369
[Music]

310
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,819
so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out what sources are</font>

311
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:34,949
receivers and sources community so just

312
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,329
keep those things in mind I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

313
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:38,579
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brief outline about what's</font>

314
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,290
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the real world today a lot</font>

315
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,638
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff is out there I think Penn</font>

316
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,309
sparse<font color="#E5E5E5"> tonight has been out that it's</font>

317
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,689
hard to nail this down because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim</font>

318
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">sparse notice something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that started</font>

319
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:48,959
morphed into what it is now and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

320
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:51,660
kind of marking into something else at

321
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,719
the moment but I think it's been I think

322
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,309
there have been implementations around

323
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,939
for about five years and if anybody

324
00:11:56,309 --> 00:12:02,009
knows different women let me know and

325
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:03,509
multicast bgp or multi protocol bgp for

326
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,480
multi casting them if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around</font>

327
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:09,720
and out in the field for like two years

328
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,790
the whole glob thing everybody's using

329
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,290
it and unfortunately it's less 24 is in

330
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of radio stations if you like</font>

331
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,139
broadcast calm or something there's

332
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:22,170
about 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> ases that have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

333
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:26,249
involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing msdp so you see on ASM</font>

334
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,979
you see SMS just a little over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 same</font>

335
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:32,129
thing with mptp which makes sense there

336
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,040
may be about 8,000 networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NB GP</font>

337
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:39,329
table and there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 12 or so</font>

338
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,009
public public exchanges and I one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,540
one of Kevin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elmer off students made a</font>

340
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,769
really nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

341
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,059
summarizes<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the stuff that's down</font>

342
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:50,009
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty nice there's a few</font>

343
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,629
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there's a lot of groups</font>

344
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:52,740
active in any time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really if you</font>

345
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:55,170
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of groups that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

346
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,089
been transmitted on in the last say time

347
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,769
period 24 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whatever you'll see</font>

348
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,779
that like thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them intransitive</font>

349
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:03,059
on so the avocent problem really is

350
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,040
significant there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there's a</font>

351
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:10,589
lot of multicast traffic around and

352
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,959
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pretty powerful alone</font>

353
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,919
backbones around two and all if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

354
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough time at the end of the social</font>

355
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">experiment it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting</font>

356
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,249
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works both of the examples so</font>

357
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:22,980
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of multicast out there a</font>

358
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:25,470
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people doing multicast it's been</font>

359
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,259
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of success with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moc plbg p.m.</font>

360
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:31,709
smart stuff but it's there's still

361
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,320
things that haven't consult so this is

362
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font>

363
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,740
slide and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the work has the real news</font>

364
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,640
on it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all this work just so</font>

365
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we might be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> construct</font>

366
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">source trees and if we didn't and if</font>

367
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,310
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we really knew a front</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

368
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,170
we wanted to do there may be a simpler

369
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,930
way to do that this is quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of</font>

370
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,219
missionary so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question really is</font>

371
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we could just build these things</font>

372
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,960
directly how do we do that well that's

373
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,949
that's what the news and multicast is

374
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,130
right now and that's where the whole

375
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,080
multicast universe has has some

376
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,460
excitement going mines and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

377
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,440
around something called s SMS or

378
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,630
specific multicast it's called search

379
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,640
specific and cuz we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where we're</font>

380
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,260
assuming that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host will know is the</font>

381
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,900
laptop host that's wanting to join this

382
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,830
group knows where the sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> came till</font>

383
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it seemed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at ease all right another nice</font>

384
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,670
review this animation here basically

385
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you want to do is you want to just</font>

386
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,240
optimize for that case with us what a

387
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,190
host already knows where the source is

388
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,110
ok so that's like you could get it up

389
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,430
you know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows we get it but you</font>

390
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's basically you want to build</font>

391
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,819
source trees and you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it do</font>

392
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,949
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this other machinery just want to</font>

393
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:40,180
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sorceries established as quickly</font>

394
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:43,720
and as simply as possible so the idea

395
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,609
here is welcome to simplify this get the

396
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,310
sorcery immediately eliminate

397
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,470
dependencies on things like msdp and fix

398
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:54,689
the address allocation problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do</font>

399
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:57,790
that oh by the way if you look on the

400
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,190
site for that allocated adversus there's

401
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,949
out there these were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach v10</font>

402
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,840
addresses that were resource reassigned

403
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,180
to the certificate multicast me and I'll

404
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,610
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you why I need that but basically</font>

405
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,770
Prince porcelain<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ariana students rightly</font>

406
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,600
saw that it can join some sorcery last

407
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">hop router synthesis of source can</font>

408
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,980
switch still so nowadays<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font>

409
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,540
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called pence or specific mode</font>

410
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">and which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of informal but this</font>

411
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,579
is what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and so this is</font>

412
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the big news and the best those people</font>

413
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,500
mostly applications around or one many

414
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,660
or few too many and this this style of

415
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,250
multicast could really support munda

416
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">menu well and probably few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dominion well</font>

417
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,710
so basically how does have some out of

418
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and way of combining the sources you</font>

419
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,480
know the canonical thing you think is

420
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,400
it's a website is click on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and</font>

421
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,700
say funds us and then what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

422
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,709
well sir price this ms come to you post

423
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,330
report and the first up rather the senza

424
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,580
that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you joining and this</font>

425
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,140
traffic all that other stuff and this

426
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,640
can be injured on the afternoon or hands

427
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,670
my domain all that other stuff don't

428
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,790
even but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do need is going back</font>

429
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,800
up into second we do need this right

430
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,939
here is you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> i to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mtv3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this</font>

431
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,140
happen right because the current

432
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,110
versions are like to give you that's

433
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:14,620
shipping whatever whatever hosts you

434
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,510
have sun or whatever as I igmp d3 which

435
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,339
doesn't have the capability to sign

436
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,400
which doesn't have the capability of

437
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:23,530
stress line posts so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's so</font>

438
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,510
that's the thing we get you can build

439
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,970
site you can build a source tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

440
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:31,150
quickly using almost the machinery

441
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:34,270
that's in income right now so what why

442
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:37,329
why can't you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as bids well the</font>

443
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">first thing this guy when it gets this</font>

444
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,010
has come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G report for some range of</font>

445
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:45,069
Elvis's it shouldn't send a star comedy

446
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:48,339
joining up this way to try to to try to

447
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,589
UM build a share tree down here<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

448
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,060
you don't want that this guy and the

449
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,280
source<font color="#CCCCCC"> things up shouldn't register</font>

450
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,810
remember what registering<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send an</font>

451
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,030
encapsulated back into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> are key and</font>

452
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">it sends attend the show tree and if</font>

453
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">this guy doesn't register the RT 17</font>

454
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,020
chemist eps a message receiver so how

455
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,270
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how can any of these</font>

456
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,770
routers this guy or this guy Last Supper

457
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,329
router second they know well you need a

458
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,490
special piece of address space to do

459
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,530
that so then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't send you'll have</font>

460
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,790
this so specific behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> into 32</font>

461
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:22,750
slicing basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's see also</font>

462
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:24,938
got here so to state the obvious on this

463
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,530
SSM thing really simplifies multicast

464
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,180
deployment in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one too many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case and</font>

465
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,920
I would argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a few them in case to</font>

466
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,450
you just don't you don't have a surf

467
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,340
location problem because you got it out

468
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,290
of am somehow you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an address</font>

469
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,600
allocation so that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need msep</font>

470
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">and thatís allocation problem because</font>

471
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,129
you're joining now to the source so the

472
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,630
effective is

473
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,130
that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all of the plus the</font>

474
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,170
addresses are local to the source

475
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,050
because you're sending in s comedy so

476
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:55,020
they start with my ports a little bit so

477
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,659
there's no address allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

478
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,280
it doesn't it does give you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

479
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,020
of source control you know you won't see

480
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,550
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing like John lander was telling</font>

481
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,400
me when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was trending on the National</font>

482
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:09,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">cessation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of some guy who consistently</font>

483
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,160
put up a picture of a Lego Space Shuttle

484
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,780
on the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> Channel and you could get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

485
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,780
didn't ever see that Denis Leary sheena

486
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,580
johnson Johnson it was wearing I never

487
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,870
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> athlete he could do that because you</font>

488
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,490
have to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tree and anybody could</font>

489
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,290
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet down under the circuitry</font>

490
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,960
but now you're in the source tree that

491
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're unless you can inject a packet on</font>

492
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,590
to that tree split with backing onto

493
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,820
that three somewhere on between the

494
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,010
source and receiver there's no way

495
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">fantasma number so and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

496
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,570
to be an easy thing to do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

497
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not it's not like security or</font>

498
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,210
anything like that but it does prevent

499
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,770
these no-brainer things from happening

500
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:48,190
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said earlier it tends bar</font>

501
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,870
can almost do this already<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the way</font>

502
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,450
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is in the t32 space</font>

503
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:54,429
the receiver the router closer to the

504
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,050
receiver won't send star come and he

505
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,670
joins<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rpd right because we</font>

506
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,110
don't mean to share tree the first

507
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,840
operator for the sender won't register

508
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,300
because we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

509
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,520
down share tree and since it didn't

510
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,649
register the RP one the RP will send us

511
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:12,580
a message is but in any of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

512
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece shouldn't send us a message okay</font>

513
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:18,669
so on that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's the big news of</font>

514
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,320
multicast right now which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so specific</font>

515
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,640
and everybody I mean everybody's doing

516
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,310
multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of excited about</font>

517
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,720
this so let me like the sprinting so the

518
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,149
sprint guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this network up for</font>

519
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,430
a long time couple year and a half or

520
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,630
two and it's they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a lot of</font>

521
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,790
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

522
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,350
standard entered on anything where you

523
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">have sparse mode</font>

524
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:44,678
[Music]

525
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:48,000
so sometimes forgotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stein had 101</font>

526
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,590
minutes on the next time actually okay

527
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,870
so okay so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network basically</font>

528
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,360
they have you have six RP spread out

529
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,850
across them across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country they have</font>

530
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,428
whole mess msdp between them and they're

531
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,649
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this trick that we're a local NHS</font>

532
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:06,370
RP we're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you do is you</font>

533
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:08,500
define a new loop back with anycast

534
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,389
address which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just some address that</font>

535
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,580
you inject into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> IEP so you have</font>

536
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,409
advertised the RP or static reconfigure

537
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,000
the RP from that address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that</font>

538
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:17,650
means that is that you get convergence

539
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,320
at the rate of your your IDP because

540
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,850
since thing is any cast wherever you are

541
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,710
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of the club since that</font>

542
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">prefix is valueless is going to the</font>

543
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,450
closest one so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it there's a home</font>

544
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,889
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropped on that completes</font>

545
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,929
interest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could tell you more</font>

546
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:34,780
about so then they had then they have

547
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:36,400
these connections and various<font color="#CCCCCC"> maps and</font>

548
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,980
they also connected with Peters network

549
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,929
I see em I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bigger snowing and</font>

550
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:47,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also with the old de amor p.m. both</font>

551
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:49,179
dreams and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the picture</font>

552
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,679
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what their back on architecture looks</font>

553
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:52,120
like basically that a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customer</font>

554
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,830
access ravaging a couple of backbone

555
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,199
routers and these things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all when</font>

556
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,639
you come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Addis ocean 48 backbone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

557
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">this thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really pretty well the</font>

558
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,340
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part or does run pretty well okay</font>

559
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they provided they provided</font>

560
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,760
multicast to<font color="#CCCCCC"> orlando's which work pretty</font>

561
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,658
well and that was that was a pretty nice

562
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,520
example of how you could actually do

563
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:13,929
this and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> work there are some</font>

564
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,090
complexity because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces</font>

565
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know we've got done something</font>

566
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,020
at work nicely the work you learn

567
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,940
actually so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's what they</font>

568
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,918
want to do they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to augment their</font>

569
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,539
existing infrastructure because a lot of

570
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,179
most people still believe there's a

571
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:30,879
place to the shared free msdp style

572
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:32,980
thing but there's also quite a bit of

573
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,240
excitement and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place for this stuff so</font>

574
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,840
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have they want to they want</font>

575
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:42,100
to do the sort of obvious thing which is

576
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,580
allow customers who want to who want to

577
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,310
have sources and

578
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,620
who want to receive that content to use

579
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">SS you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's the same as possible</font>

580
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,909
so this is what you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do</font>

581
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,070
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get igmp v3 to this to the</font>

582
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,990
hosts you got a modified Pam on the

583
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:00,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">edges of the way I mentioned rights or</font>

584
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,180
specific in basically don't don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

585
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,550
star comedy<font color="#CCCCCC"> joints towards the RP and</font>

586
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:07,730
don't register here if the groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

587
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,830
been to 32 / me and then this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is always</font>

588
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,210
an issue for providers because that's

589
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,480
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most of the customers might be</font>

590
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:18,080
for at least low bitrate services so not

591
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,930
so that's where they're at and I got

592
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide thank God from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristoff</font>

593
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:28,070
couple days ago some invisibility think

594
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,600
I GF what's up to the idea well there's

595
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,129
this whole mass massive number of

596
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,520
documents surrounding us but basically

597
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,860
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheapest i am ok so basically this</font>

598
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,680
this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> written by some guys</font>

599
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,060
in spring and some other people that

600
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,980
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> give a spring workers how to do</font>

601
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,210
this included a lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> about their</font>

602
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,310
own implementation which we kind of

603
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,930
ripped out this is an architecture

604
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,270
document about single source multicast

605
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:54,590
and how it changes the service of models

606
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:56,510
at all this is this is about the changes

607
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,959
to them that we're next named<font color="#CCCCCC"> sam jones</font>

608
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:04,220
nakamichi joins for 232 etc this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

609
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,140
the igmp v3 stuff and then there's a

610
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,600
greg has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp about what you do at you</font>

611
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,660
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Celeste</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 which is somewhat</font>

612
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,669
controversial right now because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCB</font>

613
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,230
is she<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't you know anybody has a</font>

614
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,150
content provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> has customers might</font>

615
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,800
want to comment on this but basically

616
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp is saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what you got to</font>

617
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,860
do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter it and not allow some</font>

618
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:27,350
groups that are into 32 / 8 into this m

619
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,260
stp environment so that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

620
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mtv3 enable posts</font>

621
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,950
then it could be content sources that

622
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">your customers can</font>

623
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:40,810
and that's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit controversial</font>

624
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:42,730
right now I it so few conclusions this

625
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:46,000
is the one that just kind of after i

626
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,070
looked at my smile I slides it man I

627
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,500
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to start point but as my</font>

628
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,700
major conclusion but SS family it is a

629
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and exciting thing that's</font>

630
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,210
going on for multicast I think there's a

631
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of applications that are going to be</font>

632
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,440
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take advantage of a much simpler</font>

633
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:06,370
way of delivering multicast reigns

634
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,240
doesn't replace msdp share trees all of

635
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,250
that stuff for many<font color="#CCCCCC"> too many</font>

636
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications yet and the reason I the</font>

637
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,300
reason I question it is I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yet</font>

638
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,220
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there because it seems to me that at</font>

639
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,980
least a few too many if you're going to

640
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,690
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to survive the state for one</font>

641
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,180
domain and you can do it for to them at

642
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LCD and then the whole thing is</font>

643
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,700
gated on on the availability of like I

644
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">j.mp/b three stacks for house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

645
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,560
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question everybody has is one</font>

646
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,140
will Microsoft habit and i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

647
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that's that's probably the biggest</font>

648
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,040
gating factor right now because router

649
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:44,820
vendors are getting igfbp-3 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and</font>

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,820
social Civic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not to feel quickly so</font>

651
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,260
questions or comments
