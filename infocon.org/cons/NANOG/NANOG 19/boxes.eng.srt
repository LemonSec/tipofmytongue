1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:08,129
I've done this three times now in public

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,960
so anyway I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to extend the</font>

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,349
time if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any time left once this</font>

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,269
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> has booted up to talk about how to</font>

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:18,500
look look at how to interconnect boxes

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,240
inside a network with boxes I mean

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,480
they're ours and other elements that I

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,669
can hear myself there are isn't elements

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,849
in there that we used it can somebody

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">turned in the volume download it yeah</font>

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:39,690
but I ain't okay it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a loop</font>

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:42,300
I can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an orphan TLO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,920
there is there's a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,779
you can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do and as all the</font>

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,070
possibilities today of interconnecting

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,230
things inside the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I'm</font>

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,879
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the thing and say what</font>

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,010
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do and what can't we do and</font>

19
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,449
there's also another I would like

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,180
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto volume down a little</font>

21
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,789
bit but anyway there's also a problem

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,220
here with scaling how big can I build a

23
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,640
network how do I need how do i do in

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,170
order to add more stuff and as as an

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,659
operator on trying to deliver decent

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,390
services we are limited by the stuff

27
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,850
that we can buy that actually works and

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,049
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff you can buy their</font>

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,880
empty shelves that doesn't really

30
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,710
deliver packets and the things we kept

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,369
can buy on ugly the rocket science you

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,860
want now it doesn't very funny thing it

33
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,439
stays<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1990 something and then it jumps</font>

34
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,039
backwards just to make me just much more

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,039
worried about it

36
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,719
I how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> time do I have left so far</font>

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,160
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been watching you lost ten minutes</font>

38
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,869
on bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would like I</font>

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,120
really would like to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides</font>

40
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,120
otherwise this perfect language again

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Oh

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,480
ah working and protect you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

43
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:49,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an ATM you pick the working pot</font>

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:59,089
bits coming that's look we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

45
00:02:49,489 --> 00:03:03,099
yet oh this is ATM to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the desktop</font>

46
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:05,870
technology this is how to make it work

47
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:08,980
the thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the antenna on the back</font>

48
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,980
is the wireless device

49
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,329
this all started when I wanted to let me

50
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,680
tell you what I tried to do before my

51
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer was working out fine and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,980
plugged into an effort and everybody

53
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,180
knows that if you plug into a network

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,209
with this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so you have to</font>

55
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,420
reboot it and I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

56
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:43,120
picture that I took in Jerusalem which

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,309
is the grave of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engineers because</font>

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,320
one of my apologies looks like some kind

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,320
of religious stuff and the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,299
that when some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Roman kings or</font>

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,010
whatever they were wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build then</font>

62
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,130
we build the wall or to be around

63
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,480
Jerusalem they engineers that built it

64
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,430
forget one of the buildings<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,530
important it was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> building where King</font>

66
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,300
David was buried so they chop the head

67
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,060
off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engineers there's the there's</font>

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,500
the grave of Engineers so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,490
show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see what happens if you do</font>

70
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this wrong now I right into this theorem</font>

71
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,400
deliberations will work the working

internet liberation force they came to

73
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">us and said they will blow up a building</font>

74
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,729
if we don't do certain things and they

75
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,590
wanted an internet that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move any</font>

side<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of packet they don't didn't</font>

77
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,270
want me to optimize the network for yes

78
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,490
world wide web or something else they

79
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,870
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet to build something</font>

80
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,790
into the middle of the network that was

81
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,680
a limitation they were perfectly happy

82
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,360
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> limitations i asked them</font>

83
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">what limitation will you accept I mean</font>

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,570
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said well the amount of green</font>

85
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,080
money we can give you so said that's

86
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,890
fine that translates to if you're doing

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,280
limitations in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network they have to</font>

88
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:53,950
be at the edge if sometimes useful to

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,299
send packets then<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethernet has given us</font>

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,280
have the screening thing the metal thing

96

and you have to try really hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,310
people have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointing out if I solve</font>

an earlier

108
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,780
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some things going on if</font>

109
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,610
you do big buffers that we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,549
into yet and may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even run into and</font>

111
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:43,400
the users want an effort to work 365

112
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,140
days a year and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a laugh i</font>

113
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,989
saw an ad from some beer company that

114
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,940
said it was 364 days of<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice and</font>

115
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:54,920
then that was synthetic today and that

116
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:58,219
this year there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> safe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 366 days this</font>

117
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,930
is a simple view of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet we have</font>

118
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,190
the you threat to end at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very far</font>

119
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,480
end there there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

120
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,840
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like ether nets at the end of the</font>

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,580
routers and usually they are you friends

122
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's the most common way of</font>

123
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,169
connecting computers today I think

124
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,450
everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legacy stuff even as</font>

125
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,340
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we're all social speeds then</font>

126
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,840
there's runner as a tail circuit then it

127
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,359
goes into the middle of the network and

128
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,940
the middle of the network you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

129
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,560
able to carry larger package than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500</font>

130
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,200
if you want to encapsulate or whatever

131
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,640
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with them there's also a</font>

game called then with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> photon</font>

133
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,969
which is basically how much buffering

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,500
you can deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> in any point of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

136
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,700
for many years now we've been playing

137
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">around and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say the maximum delay of the</font>

138

140
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,770
any bigger stream onto the network so

141
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,750
100 megabits x 350 milliseconds at 4.4

142
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,370
megabytes and it turns out from a

143
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,870

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is world wide</font>

180

web so they said they had have content

181
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:19,188
and then you have users and customers

182
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:21,379
and they are usually connected with

183
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:24,800
something and traditionally there were

184
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:27,560
t1 there are t1 e1 ATM LC<font color="#E5E5E5"> fries and</font>

186
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,390
and there may be a layer of frame relay

187
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,370
and ATM switch is in there too and in

188

between the access of errors in the

195
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,589
you talk to you now how do we

196
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,649
interconnect the stuff in the middle

197
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:55,579
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I left spaces open well if</font>

198
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:57,649
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form for a second</font>

199
00:08:55,579 --> 00:09:00,140
you can put some time to switch there

200
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:01,790
and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this switch is going</font>

201
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,769
to be the thing where you come from a

202
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,849
slow pipe pipe to a big pipe and if you

203
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:08,899
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> celebrate to the C flat based</font>

204
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,470
workstations or service that sits on

205
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like pcs this smart switch</font>

206
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,660
there has to do all your policy so the

207
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,490
point of policy is done there so my way

208
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using at this this is usually called</font>

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,380
a layer 1 2 3 4<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 6 something switch but</font>

210
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,630
in reality it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the big valley that</font>

211
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,910
can be policy and healing right so if

212
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,800
you connect the server farm the thing is

213
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,860
put the clean your virus and the

214
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">server's has to implement the policy or</font>

215

<font color="#E5E5E5">went to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Becca how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rate wet how to do</font>

216
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,560
bandwidth limitations and this is where

217
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,019
the buffers get built up because that's

218
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,180
the poor poor point of congestion with

219
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:47,870
policy here I mean anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do access list or something so we</font>

222
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">end up finding that we have to have an</font>

element<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it looks like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> runner and</font>

224
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,910
you may ask yourself the question why

225
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,620
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with another box there</font>

226
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,180
does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing as too big back on</font>

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,530
the office<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just that I got some</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of logical separation now go to the</font>

229
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,339
part of the recipe that I do understand

230
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,470
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about if you want to</font>

231
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,810
go from your core to your access boxes

232
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,530
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take 100 megabit Ethernet and</font>

233
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:19,619
Honda megabit Ethernet 101 you could go

234
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">by a hug its twenty six dollars of</font>

235
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,970
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you put connect the cables</font>

236
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,099
like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an interesting</font>

237
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,260
property and it's half the effects right

238
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,360
but when the thing in the middle the

239
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,670
ethernet hub gets congested and I point

240
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there are three points so where you</font>

241
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,439
can get congestion and policy it's on

242
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,880
the corner on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the access ladder facing</font>

243
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,410
the ethernet switch and then downwards

244
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,630
towards a customer because it's a

245
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,250
customer if we get too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much package from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network going towards the</font>

customary that TV were four packets

248
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,620
going on down to t1 we have to do

249
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,089
something and the simplest thing is just

250
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,010
first try to buffer and its<font color="#CCCCCC"> development</font>

251
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:56,160
big enough drop it or we may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

252
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,960
different skewing queuing algorithms

253
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,550
dropping algorithm so we have access

254
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,100
lists that put different kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> package</font>

255
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,290
into different cues but it's the place

256
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,820
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're proposing the interesting</font>

257
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing with the setup like this is that</font>

258
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,590
that when you get congestion in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in</font>

259
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,840
the ethernet<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment you get pushed back</font>

00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,030
into all the routers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if the</font>

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:20,100
router is trying to sell to the middle

263
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,960
access ladder and there's already 100

wait until we find is freed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to transmit and you get</font>

269

conditions so the Q gets built<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the</font>

270
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,160
road so whatever small drawer you have

271
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,349
you only need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the value of what</font>

272
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,730
to do when you get congestion in there

273
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,550
there's no more magic right so it's

274
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,680
harder stored in the backbone router or

275
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,569
access ladder but nowhere else so

276
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,660
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> no more other place</font>

277
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,610
where you have to apply policy this

278
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,199
limits the packet size that i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

279
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,030
to the same packet size that i can get

280
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,650

00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,120

331
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,340

make my electric much better at the

small ISP where I understanding a lot of

338
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,300
time we used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an effort to look</font>

339
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,800
like this we had backbone routers and we

340
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,030
had point-to-point packet over sonet

341
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,709
circuits they don't have the property

342
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,689
that they connected support large

343
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,430
packets but

344
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,080
yes they were slow and they were pretty

345
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to traffic managers kind of</font>

348
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,100
of point-to-point links because if you

349
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,439
want to shift some band-aid over to

350
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,600
another Xbox it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very doable but</font>

351
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,310
this sold some of the problems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

put the policy would kept inside the

i am i'm keeping you guys from beer so i

know i understand i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire up now</font>

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:56,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to our router vendor and</font>

359
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,970
said hey do something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

360
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,220
previous speaker probably said

361
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,360
everything about srp before I enter the

362
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,890
room but the key thing here are two

363
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,630
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is the space or reuse thing</font>

364
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,970
right what I'm using between two of the

boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> next to each other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

366
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,950
not allocated elsewhere on the ring so

367
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,859
on an ethernet hub right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

368
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:20,110
swear two guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked entire hub is</font>

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,060
each other are talking only that piece

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,130
of fiber is occupied by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

372
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,439
it can be reused again the other

373
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,540
interesting property of this thing is

374
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,510
that once you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet on the wire</font>

375
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,400
one you have an output queue from the

376
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,810
router that goes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber once it</font>

377
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,120
gets on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber it's actually going to</font>

378
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,650
stay there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means that once you</font>

379
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,780
got the seats on the fly even if the

380
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,280
flight stops in 15 cities before you get

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,069
queuing algorithm which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

385
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,690
the virus does a policy decision it's

that we stick with because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going if</font>

388
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,699
the writer makes a decision to use its

<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like this where we slice the ring</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the spatial reviews thing and in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">idol severe scenario because you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,890
packet into different classes and then

425
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,589
you schedule them out to the shared

426
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,780
resource and this actually works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

427
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:26,280
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it doesn't</font>

428
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,629
have any of the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it doesn't</font>

429
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,040
need to use another element that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

430
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,960
have to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to somebody tried to tell</font>

431
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,389
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> while you we can build a ring out of</font>

432
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,830
switches so if you take ethernet

433
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,690
switches and you put point-to-point

434
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,360
Giggy verse or 10 gige furs and you do

435
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this you run spanning</font>

436
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,159
tree and spanning tree defines one box

437
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> root and then it wants to see it free</font>

438
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,910
not the ring so what's going to happen

439
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,280
if you turn on spanning tree on a

440
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,990
khopoli like this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to use</font>

441
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment in the bottom because that</font>

442
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,640
the decree of the rout is on top so you

443
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">really only use half of your ring yes</font>

444
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,160
you have redundancy with all spanning

445
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,559
tree it took basically a minute or so<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

446
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,559
recover they have done lots of changes

447
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,000
today in like four or five rtts can

448
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,590
actually reconfigure the spanning tree

449
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,809
so they've done a lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on</font>

450
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,909
the switch side but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still can't get</font>

451
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,610
access that and the second thing is this

452
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:22,679
when once packet comes on the wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

453
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,010
downstream and new packets come into the

454
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,559
same box there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no precedent I haven't</font>

455
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen any of course you can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this maybe</font>

456
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,918
but I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen anybody doing it</font>

457
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,380
there is no way where those boxes can

458
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,900
deal with the fact that song traffic is

459
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,000
already police that has to go vs some

460
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,940
packets yes some traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go center</font>

461
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,380
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> box locally so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using putting</font>

462
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,029
switches in the ring doesn't really do

463
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,340
the same for

464
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:47,929
as doing a ring of routers and even if

465
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:54,080
you put virus behind the switches you

466
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:55,820
know have the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everything so</font>

467
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,769
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we cantle are today and</font>

468
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we go scratch our head and saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

469
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,570
scratch my head I said how do I make the

470
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:04,399
network bigger because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this</font>

471
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,899
nasty thing called customers that we

472
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:10,879
have to deal with if we didn't have

473
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:12,199
customers life will be good now if you

474
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:14,149
take one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the biggest boxes and I</font>

475
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,009
think this actually applies to all the

476
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:19,908
big boxes you can buy they seem to have

477
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:21,499
16 x OC 192 some of them uses two slots

478
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,119
for the brain substitute to thinking

479
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:26,179
device and you may use one or two of

480
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,309
them if you play around with this device

481
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:30,320
and say okay what's the biggest biggest

482
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:35,299
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build with this that</font>

483
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually works I in this example have</font>

484
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:42,589
used six slots out of my 16 I used up to

485
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:45,168
two or one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RP I used up to four</font>

486
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:47,539
no six for access and then you need to

487
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:49,009
interconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your boxes and then I have</font>

488
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,489
five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> four depending on how many</font>

489
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:57,409
brains you have left over on each box to

490
00:19:52,489 --> 00:20:00,799
connect your visor your links so if you

491
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,499
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like this you take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all your</font>

492
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,769
access boxes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put them in a ring</font>

493
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:09,320
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> break the ring the same way we</font>

494
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:11,559
did on the first page but assume that in

495
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,330
this picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're blue green and red</font>

496
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,158
srp wings or DPT rings or whatever the

497
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,799
market is so just choose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it this</font>

498
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,309
week are running at OC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40hp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have two</font>

499
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,649
x OC 48 on each of those rings if each

500
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the boxes small boxes have two times</font>

501
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:29,508
societal it were for customers coming in

502
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">I got an oversubscription of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 421 on the</font>

503
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:33,919
ring it's an interesting scenario

504
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:35,539
because it's 41 on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

505
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,089
actually both neck before it gets to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

506
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:40,099
router so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have transit traffic on</font>

507
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:41,899
my IP network<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have more</font>

508
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:44,178
capacity in the transit network than I

509
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:45,439
have on the exercise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

510
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:47,719
make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let me save some more</font>

511
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,249
pictures now is where I wanted to put

512
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:52,070
the picture of it pick the picture of

513
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,850
the grave of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Engineers I said something</font>

514
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,189
stupid again

515
00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:02,189
two girls back here hunting or any other

516
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:03,480
blonde so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where I wanted to put</font>

517
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,190
the picture of the grave of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the earth</font>

518
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:12,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I ended up finding it this looks</font>

519
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">like some religious symbol this is the</font>

520
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,160
biggest you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can build with a 16 port</font>

521
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,110
router using basically have two switches

522
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,200
in here once which is the fabric of your

523
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the address which is your access</font>

524
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,490
ring and the excess wing is actually one

525
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,419
single wing that goes around that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

526
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:32,640
broken up in nine segments<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the</font>

527
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,820
nutshell<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the four</font>

528
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,669
slots left that goes to every pop of the

529
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,770
right area circus okay you can't double

530
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this again because then you will use all</font>

531
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:44,908
your ports to interconnect boxes in your

532
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,960
pop and you can't get you don't get any

533
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:52,080
slots to connect your right area circuit

534
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:58,530
so with insulin get nine letters<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

535
00:21:52,080 --> 00:22:01,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">make excess routers I get 36 36 OC 192</font>

536
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:05,879
is worth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide area capacity or if you</font>

537
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,380
count in LC 48 is 144 OC 48 or if you

538
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,659
pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the art piece out and only</font>

539
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:16,470
have one you get 44 45 0 0 90 to 180 OC

540
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:21,299
48 worth of capacity now if you count

541
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:24,570
Diaz please you get 65 a 67,000 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8600</font>

542
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,429
Diaz please work up front capacity if we

543
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,049
did for 21 oversubscription between my

544
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:31,169
actually the access box is shown in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

545
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:34,168
picture and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core boxes I can support</font>

546
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">10,000 vs fries with this pop so I have</font>

547
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:41,429
10,000 vs fries coming out of that box

548
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,230
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the default 21 / subscription that's</font>

549
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:46,200
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> way then I have for chronic</font>

550
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,789
dry and the funny thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is this is</font>

551
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,220
completely redundant for everything yes

552
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:51,210
you may lose capacity if you lose a box

553
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,610
but you're never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose</font>

554
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,950
connectivity and losing a bark is not

555
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,229
too bad where the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

556
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,720
patterns we have so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is fully</font>

557
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,790
redundant up to the access box and there

558
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,980
is no protection switching for<font color="#CCCCCC"> DSPs</font>

559
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,600
anyway so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just connect have to do a</font>

560
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,790
home your customer

561
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,699
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the old backbone online</font>

562
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,500
projectors if you take the ol black

563
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,180
phone right and you the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

564
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,390
adding more circuit is that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

565
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:22,490
customers we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more traffic and for</font>

566
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,980
every point-to-point link like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 a</font>

567
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:28,070
to pop be there are eight circuits<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

568
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,590
ye I assume this before top of them are

569
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,540
40 c190 tues there are four wavelengths

570
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,010
on the same fiber they are and then

571
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,840
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the Dashon ones there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

572
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,580
dashing ones below them they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

573
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">and other fiber paths and the real</font>

574
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:43,699
requirements between those<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts are</font>

575
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:47,570
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four or six the optical OC</font>

576
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:51,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">192 because if you cut the fiber you</font>

577
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,689
lose capacity now everybody talks about

578
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:55,730
60 milliseconds and restorations and

579
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:59,600
protection and then going to venture the

00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:01,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">n-word</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today if you look at an effort</font>

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,169
look like this is official spaghetti and

582
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:08,178
I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional is called this</font>

583
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:10,370
mesh network so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this</font>

584
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:12,020
from from surveillance survivability

586
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,220
break the significant thing you can lose

587
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,650
here our EDSA optical amplifiers and

588
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:22,130
fibers okay loosen<font color="#E5E5E5"> your router doesn't</font>

589
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:24,050
need doesn't show up I mean if you put

590
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:26,000
obstacles switches between the pop then

591
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:30,889
this long haul fiber you can do what

592
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,290
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> call traffic engineering so I</font>

593
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:37,130
have a suggestion for local area traffic

594
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:39,260
engineering tools if you take a wire

595

00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,640

00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:53,059
the missile bird fiber the only thing

601
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,489
you need to your mpls LSP RSVP

602
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:57,860
configuration system is to tell customer

603
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:00,920
building location type of building and

604
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:05,290
type of rules and<font color="#CCCCCC"> andy's the lost</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Messiah with the power damn it on demand</font>

606
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:15,850
now I was showing so my point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

607
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,130
when I do this I had 11 1 plus 1 light

608
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,780
they could twice as much capacity in as

609
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,880
I really need this is a safe way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

610
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,740
living in reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to sell the</font>

611
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,600
 out of this so you may sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> down a</font>

612
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,750
scratch your head and figure out where

613
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,879
would I actually have capacity diagram

614
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,410
can be used for restoration and it turns

615
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,510
out every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font>

616
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,190
work and it always ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> up being</font>

617
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,660
something you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of and it's</font>

618
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">even worth if you do trafficking in your</font>

619
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,260
path yes there it's nice but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

620
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,050
think figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out all the states this</font>

621
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,400
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they end up in so throwing fire at</font>

622
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,840
the problem is really nice and it keeps

623
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,500
the customers very happy and they say

624
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">mumps and money anyway oh another</font>

625
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,610
internet work like this the thing that

626
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,570
actually is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break is bgp</font>

627
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:00,270
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias which is IDP is</font>

628
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,669
actually fine even for this spaghetti

629
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:06,070
but using the dtp<font color="#E5E5E5"> external</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lighting</font>

630
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol as an igp as we are doing makes</font>

631
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,899
it really hard because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 120</font>

632
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,180
nodes in each pop service served by the

633
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,220
router factor and yes it works but the

634
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,900
propagation<font color="#CCCCCC"> plants are awful you want to</font>

635
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,330
restore<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in less than</font>

636
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,990
a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can't send updates fast</font>

637
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:24,850
enough using<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP with existing stuff and</font>

638
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:33,610
it's actually we're where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

639
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:37,750
some new work so observation from this

640
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:39,639
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it exercise is that if you look at</font>

641
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,840
this is a throughout the boxes I go look

642
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,160
at a real net but we have a lots of

643
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,870
boxes various really dumb and stupid

644
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,100
full boxes so the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of boxes</font>

645
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:51,129
doesn't really change it can keep the

646
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:54,969
large ISP ok so the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest</font>

647
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,560
ISPs free time my example right so in

648
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,900
the example every nine months so

649
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,520
somebody producing<font color="#E5E5E5"> big boxes has to</font>

650
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,020
deliver the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big box before march two</font>

651
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,310
thousand and two because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't figure</font>

652
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:07,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">out a way to make an effort bigger</font>

653
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:10,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">riddick system stuff another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> observation</font>

654
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,679
that i found was 10,000 years please

655
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,350
going out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the building to customers</font>

656
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">des breezes pdh stop right and then if</font>

657
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,810
you add up<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much money that the the</font>

658
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,030
sonnet and

659
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,220
that stuff costs it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money than I</font>

660
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,760
spend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the writers and it has to be</font>

661
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:28,630
obstacle because vs<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 runs 30 days or 10</font>

662
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,860
meters or something our coax so maybe

663
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,510
they have to put fiber into the building

664
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,699
and if they put fiber into the building

665
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,750
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should take my taxes ring and</font>

666
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,640
run it all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the building</font>

667
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,230
instead and not buying the sonnet ADM

668
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,560
not buying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dyaks multiplying the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun</font>

669
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,180
at ADM and not buying the line card so i

670
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,429
think that sometime during this

671
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,900
evaluation curve we are going to change

672
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,280
things because we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point where</font>

673
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,020
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put fibers into the building</font>

674
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the router there i</font>

675
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,530
arrived on the ds3 back to back in the

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,210
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why here is your D mark alright</font>

678
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,680
go find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that speaks even</font>

disclaimer ok this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thinking we</font>

have around what we can and can't do

687
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,229
what how we can design a network we're

688
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,000
looking at doing what we can and can't

689
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,860
do this is not what we're doing it's not

690
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,590
the commitment from anybody including
