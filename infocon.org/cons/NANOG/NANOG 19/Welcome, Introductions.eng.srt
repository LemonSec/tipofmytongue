150
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,210
Albuquerque one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

151
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,020
noticed is that it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be some of</font>

152
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,430
our faces are new faces out there and

153
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,620
glad to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are new people</font>

154
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,140
showing up one of the things that's

155
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,700
really important from a host perspective

156
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,780
and certainly from from my perspective

157
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:53,419
as a host is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooperative effort the</font>

158
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,919
internet was born in my understandings

159
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,190
and then what I've heard and learned

160
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,020
through a cooperative effort and I think

161
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> events needed to continue to</font>

162
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:06,260
be in a cooperative effort and so to

163
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,520
that extent susan has<font color="#E5E5E5"> already mentioned</font>

164
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,960
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our folks and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to</font>

165
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of go over them and tell you what</font>

166
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,229
they've done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the benefits of</font>

167
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:17,180
their help has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been for those of you</font>

168
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,070
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done man off you understand and</font>

169
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,130
though the the undertaking that it takes

170
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,080
to put one of these together and for

171
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,789
those of you that haven't you get to sit

172
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,609

174
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,370
those I've done man out a couple times

175
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,479
because well they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any hair</font>

176
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:38,419
left that sells<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue for you to last</font>

177
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,089
anyway Native<font color="#CCCCCC"> American systems is a</font>

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,370
local cabling vendor they wired the

179
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,310
hotel one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I really</font>

180
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,130
to see happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

185
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,270
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important that we</font>

186
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,740
leave stuff behind as we move forward

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,700
day has never happened ever and the net

292
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,370
was able to communicate to the people

293
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were pushed away and evacuated out</font>

294
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,030
of their houses the people whose homes

295
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,980
have burned down or they didn't know

296
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that their homes were burnt down able to</font>

297
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,570
communicate that insult and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

298
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool thing I think</font>

299
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,380
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we all is network</font>

300
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,449
engineers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintain errs and networks</font>

301
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,040
and feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud about healthy and we</font>

302
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,320
should help our communities<font color="#CCCCCC"> in those</font>

303
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,120
respects it gave us the ability to

304
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,760
quickly take something like my sequel an

305
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,920
open source product and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push</font>

306
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,960
that on a database to allow people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

307
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,479
search the finance at home was burned or

308
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,160
not to find out whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not their</font>

309
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,020
pets that got saved out of the house

310
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,790
we're okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what shelter were they in</font>

311
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,550
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're we're loved ones when they got</font>

312
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,319
split things like that and that's what's

313
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,530
really cool about from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that you</font>

314
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,210
can get to it anywhere anytime and I

315
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we need to remember that as we go</font>

316
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,220
out of here and go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

317
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,750
building our nets and building

318
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">connectivity is that let's have some fun</font>

319
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:25,100
let's do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> good let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a few</font>

320
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,100
dollars and I think in about that order
