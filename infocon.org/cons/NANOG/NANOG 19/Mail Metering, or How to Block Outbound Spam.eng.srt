I could see a show of hands that people

29

they come in and say can we modify our

how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we come up with an effective way</font>

to block outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam</font>

86
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,900
goals are always easy to come up with

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you come up with a presentation but</font>

some goals prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implementing this</font>

90
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,620
back in december i would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font>

91
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,318
that the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to block at least fifty</font>

92
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,110
percent of outbound spam would be a

93
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,590
worthy goal in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we can go on</font>

94
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,729
a limb here and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can block</font>

95
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,030
upwards of eighty percent of outbound

96
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:51,008
spam with this solution now the

97
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,609
requirement is that it has to have

98
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:57,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">little or no impacts on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp and the</font>

99
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,740
subscriber this gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> into why we have to</font>

100
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,539
use layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switches to redirect the</font>

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,539
smtp connections<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll talk about that in</font>

102
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:07,659
a minute have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exclude</font>

103
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:10,240
certain domains some folks like net zero

104
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:13,120
are doing a fantastic job keep it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

105
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">block and spam it's got to be</font>

106
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,500
configurable and scalable I think we've

107
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,138
achieved that we have to have a low

108
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,479
impact on our radius servers and can't

109
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:28,090
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> causing a revenue to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

110
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:31,380
toilet ever blocking span I think we've

111
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:34,810
achieved that and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always nice to</font>

112
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,610
utilize freely available software now

113
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,659
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting how this project came</font>

114
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:43,690
about I had this idea about a year ago

115
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:46,659
and when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned it to our president</font>

116
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,190
Chris Jenkins he basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> poo-pooed it</font>

117
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:51,159
and said we don't have money for blah

118
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,740
blah blahs were too busy with her IPO so

119
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:57,310
about six months after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> December</font>

120
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,990
of 99 he got an email from her query

121
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,050
from the chairman<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our board records</font>

122
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,759
Eric sacks asking why was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

123
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,129
friends wife one of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends got and</font>

124
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,479
spammed from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> zip line customer so of</font>

125
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:10,270
course Chris comes running to me and

126
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:14,650
says what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing about spam I said</font>

127
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,818
Chris remember that idea I had so that's

128
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,310
when you open up the checkbook and

129
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,310
eighty thousand dollars later Here I am

130
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:31,860
there are surprisingly few existing

131
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:33,419
solutions for spam the most interesting

132
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,430
one from my perspective is something

133
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,409
called blackmail by Ken<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hollis and James</font>

134
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:43,199
Murray we took a look at this it does

135
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:45,930
sort of header based checking checks for

136
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,879
existence of a from domain though some

137
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,400
other things it's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> package but</font>

138
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,479
it's focused on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem of inbound</font>

139
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,998
spam included snap bean smtpd which

140
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:01,370
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> are spam solutions per se but you</font>

141
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:04,169
can use them to assist in blocking spam

142
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,439
they're more proxy solutions for

143
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:10,580
proxying through a firewall there's

144
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,979
bright mail by bright light technologies

145
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:17,550
fantastic job these guys are doing it's

146
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:21,210

tend to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to manage when you</font>

have upwards of 500 filters that you

on us so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for the bad</font>

166
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,639
performance is the processing power that

with it is it requires changes to

to adjust we have three different<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels</font>

that we check as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a user</font>

00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,949

messages per time interval settings that

299
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,820
we can check the intent here is to have

300
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,950
sort of a less time interval in a higher

301
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,950

the first

306
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:22,479
it's an existing quote it exits so if

there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> user level quota set the</font>

310

set it drops down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the domain or realm</font>

313
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:39,220
across the database hopefully there's a

the slide there it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note</font>

317
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,299
that these are simply compiled in

319
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:54,189

a good thing if you ask me

337
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:48,069
a few more miscellaneous points on the

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:50,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">mail relays users who have large to list</font>

we all know the Oracle never dies

there's problems with everything this is

for giving zip link the opportunity to

has absolutely nothing to do with an ISP

408

as First Amendment talks about the
