00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:08,400
hold good afternoon to everyone my name

is miguel de<font color="#E5E5E5"> tu go and work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> correctly my</font>

00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,100
yeah we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> present you today</font>

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:20,369
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our current setting up</font>

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,779
Confederations for well<font color="#CCCCCC"> / initially the</font>

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,250
basically quite quite a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago now we</font>

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,960
will cused to work the old mine spring

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,300
before it got bought out by earthlink

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,309
and bronze came in to us one<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and</font>

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,069
said how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys doing redesigning the</font>

17
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,000
BGP architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and we</font>

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good answer because</font>

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,550
we really hadn't thought about it so we

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,010
had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with a cool reasonable</font>

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,019
sensible scalable way to redesign our

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,899
network architecture now the advantage

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had at that time was that we</font>

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,829
weren't in a situation where we had lots

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,049
and lots of legacy customers we had

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,390
millions of dial-up customers so we had

27
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,310
an unusual degree of latitude and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ritas</font>

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,520
on your network and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as cool</font>

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,220
and as is resilient as survivable as

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,020
scalable as possible so we looked at a

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,000
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different options we looked at</font>

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,908
route reflectors for a while we look at

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,509
ibgp mesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while for a long time we</font>

34
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:27,049
were an isolated ebgp but we finally

35
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,930
settled on a confederation approach

36
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:32,670
basically there's a couple ways of doing

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,560
your network architecture you know

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,340
there's kind of an older way and there's

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,650
a newer way now the older way you know

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,409
is more classically of a time when

41
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,640
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like ATM you know we're big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

42
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">team of course is still big in our</font>

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,000
networks it's in all of our networks but

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,220
ATMs time time is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of coming to pass</font>

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,450
it's as we move into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future what</font>

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,880
we're looking at now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet over</font>

47
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">sonet we're looking at lighting up huge</font>

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,710
fiber ring networks packet over sonet

49
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,229
ATM is moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the edge for coming</font>

50
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,570
aggregation technology so a lot of the

51
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,179
old ways of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing things to conventional</font>

52
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,859
network architectures the full mesh ibgp

53
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,070
a fully mesh network via ATM

54
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:19,480
PVCs that stuff is moving away<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

55
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:21,130
differs is receding into the past so you

56
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,750
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> here here's what we didn't like</font>

57
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we looked at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the more</font>

58
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,820
conventional ways of doing business we

59
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,769
feel that it's not adapted to the sort

60
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,880
of sonnet optical ring networks that we

61
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,110
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at packed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over sonet is the</font>

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,519
big technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all making that</font>

63
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:42,459
jump you know ATM alpaca over sonet in

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,870
there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of fragility basically</font>

65
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,550
we felt the older ways from the route

66
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,760
reflector architecture certainly the

67
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,640
full mesh ibgp or far more fragile<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,630
some of the stuff we were looking at

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,529
finally some of the old ways of doing

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">things were prone to user error in</font>

71
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,350
today's kind of internet environment we

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,150
thought we needed something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

73
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,640
much more resilient<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you couldn't</font>

74
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,620
bring down the customer by a typo where

75
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,540
you know fiber cut wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

76
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,070
wasn't going to cause a major network

77
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,900
outage so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we looked out with a</font>

78
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,970
couple preconditions with a couple

79
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,600
criteria when we sort of did this

80
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,560
network approach can you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back with</font>

81
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,350
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is we wanted to</font>

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,900
emphasize large-scale ip-based fiber

83
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,900
ring networks where there's no ipx going

84
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,269
on here there's no SNA no there's none

85
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,220
of that weird stuff this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

86
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,049
big we<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't going to start it small</font>

87
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,049
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale up when it was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be big</font>

88
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:40,480
big from the beginning so we did we kind

89
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,970
of skip some steps we knew was going to

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,859
be based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fiber ring that's kind of</font>

91
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,470
a big thing we knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> to play the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leased</font>

93
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,870
we're not going to do it that we're

94
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,670
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing what everyone else</font>

95
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,440
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing lighting up lambdas</font>

96

lighting up dark fiber also in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIT</font>

97
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,549
real portion of this at least our main

98
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,470
customer service providers so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:06,519
kind of optimize this for for the needs

100
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:08,109
of service providers and the big other

101
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,230
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> went together this were great</font>

102
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,390
fault tolerance in other words we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

103
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,010
good failure modes anyone can design a

104
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,659
network that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to operate great</font>

105
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,548
when every piece of equipment in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

106
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,739
network and every strand of fiber is

107
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,479
operating a top efficiency what we

108
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,549
wanted to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is provide good failure</font>

109
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,359
modes so that when the failures that we

110
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,300
knew are going to

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,349
happen happened we'd still<font color="#CCCCCC"> be okay but</font>

112
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,090
our customers would still get the

00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:33,878
service they were paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> us for in the</font>

114
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,049
service they deserved the other thing we

115
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,569
wanted out of this was some usable

116
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,520
traffic engineering the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MPLS is all well</font>

117
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,050
and good but mpls is not quite out of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the oven yet you know we needed</font>

traffic engineering abilities without

00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:51,909

125
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,688
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course briefly in it and of</font>

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">course rejected was a full ibgp mesh now</font>

127
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:07,810
the problem here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just review</font>

128
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,129
this I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure a lot of you guys know you</font>

129
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,449
know what's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a full I bgp</font>

00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:12,699
metrical<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll go through the whole</font>

131
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,069
mental exercise is of course when you

132
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,439
have two routers in your network to bgp

133
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:20,590
speakers and I vgt mesh works great

134
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:24,909
three it still kind of works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when</font>

135
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,739
you get to 4 5 6 2016 or 100 adding a

136
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:29,409
new work bgp speaking writer to the

137
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">network becomes a major exercise and if</font>

138
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:34,419
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss one you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suboptimal</font>

139
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:37,509
routing you know so what's going on here

140
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,758
every router and full mesh ibgp must be

141
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:41,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">messed with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every other bgp speaking</font>

143
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,900
where the number of links grows

144
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:49,389
exponentially eventually you consume all

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,919
cpu all memory and all of your

146
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:55,930

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,129
alternative and use probably in many of

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,169
the networks around here is route

00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:04,689
reflectors now rubber<font color="#E5E5E5"> flushes is fine</font>

151
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:07,839
architecture particularly if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

152
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:10,150
full mesh ATM topology a star network

<font color="#E5E5E5">works very nicely because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think</font>

154
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,580
about how route reflectors work you're

155
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:17,770
presupposing a star<font color="#E5E5E5"> system you're</font>

156
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,460
presupposing having a rail reflector

157
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,830
server like these guys and accompanying

158
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,960
route reflector clients like these guys

159
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,878
the problem is we're building a ring

160
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,669
here we're not building a star and even

161
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:33,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">frankly even when you had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ATM PVCs they</font>

162
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:35,709
weren't physical so you know we're ATM

163
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,909
redirects<font color="#CCCCCC"> its to follow side so</font>

164
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,259
basically we looked at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> said okay what</font>

165
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,129
happens if we blow<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that piece of</font>

166
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,869
fiber there

167

and we blow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> this piece of fiber here</font>

168
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:44,139
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem you can get us have it</font>

169
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,209
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have rubber foot rail reflect</font>

00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:55,058
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rail reflector server so we thought</font>

174
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:57,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">this wasn't sufficiently survivable and</font>

175
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:59,889
a fiber ring network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted to</font>

176
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,969
look a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on swear the final</font>

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing we didn't like about some of the</font>

178
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:04,089
conventional ways we had done things and

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the conventional ways we saw</font>

181
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,589
we did not like the fact that list of IP

00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:19,539
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bothered is what we thought that</font>

185
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:21,399
did not scale in any way it would work

186
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,378
very well when most customers were

187
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,689
single home I'm you look you know

188
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,309
historically say three or four years ago

189
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,319
and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your customers were</font>

190
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:31,240
really running vgp with you and then

191
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,159
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data today the percentage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

193

194
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,639
know and why is this come about because

195
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:42,039
of e-commerce because the old days

196
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,050
internet access was a luxury it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice thing like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know 11</font>

need to backup connection you need bgp

202
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,240
and when you start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge huge</font>

203
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:01,029
number of bgp sessions to turn up having

your border routers just isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

206
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:08,379
advantageous the changes were very

207
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:10,679
manpower intensive and certainly prone

208
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,679
to error

209
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:18,030
so we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

210
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,640
Confederations basically that the system

211
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,809
we designed was in each pop and of

212
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,789
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> this aren't necessarily just</font>

213
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,240
really one router but each one of these

214
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,610
represents a pop each pop is going to is

215
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,820
going to pier with each other pop every

216
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,520
pop becomes a confederation sub a s of

217
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,460
its own the advantages here that the

218
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,439
routers only pier with our neighbors

219
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,479
highly survivable you get a fiber cut

220
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,370
here it doesn't matter you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know century</font>

types of peering relationships between

263
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:17,099
bgp speaking routers you can have ibgp

which we all use for external peering or

00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,530
has its own kind of unique set of rules

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:27,330
with full mesh ibgp all routers within

290
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,339

route reflector<font color="#CCCCCC"> Confederation and what</font>

292
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,740
we mean there is that lets say you have

293
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,110
one Confederation per pot you're fine in

294
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,020
the Confederation<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup for all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you whether you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a full mesh</font>

300
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,480
or route reflectors Confederations are

301
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,569
most advantageous when there are fewer

304
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:06,270
you have nothing is gained

305
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:09,330
our Confederation design started with

306
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,390
two sub a s numbers so do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said okay</font>

307
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,580
we'll do the east and we'll do the last

308
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:17,340
then we had maybe 30 40 pops in each

309
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,020
half of the country the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

310
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,660
this doesn't offer a lot of advantages

311
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,780
over full mesh ibgp you just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

312
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">smaller full meshes but we found that</font>

313
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,470
the more sub a s as you add the greater

314
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,060
the advantage you got and all of the

315
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we talked about earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

316
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,699
survivability flexibility and ease of

317
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:38,250
configuration so when we finally boiled

318
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,760
it down what we got to at the end was

319
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,340
having one sub a s number per pop each

320
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,550
pop would be its own island in a sea of

321
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:50,100
a confederation and of course the upper

322
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,500
limit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this is 1000 sub autonomous</font>

323
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,480
systems / RFC and of course you won't

324
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,580
see in an RFC that it says you'd only

325
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,200
have 1000 members of a confederation

326
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,900
what it does say is that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

what we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here is the</font>

332
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:17,630
routers within each pop need to only

339
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,350
far more scalable than a route reflector

341

344
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,240

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,090
communities are set at the ingress<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

436
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,000
basically these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some internal routes</font>

437
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,330
wheezing 4355 that's bill<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind spring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

438
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">s number basically we're going to say</font>

439
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:53,030
that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these routes 2769 / 16 is</font>

440
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,920
going to be a green route we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

441
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,080
call what this community that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

442
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,600
picking green we're going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

443
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:04,580
other network the 199 network is going

444
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,959
to be a red community<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay these are</font>

445
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">some transit routes that we're getting</font>

446
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">in from uunet basically we're going to</font>

447
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">make these transit routes blue will call</font>

448
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,399
that community blue so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see in</font>

449
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,280
our little routing table here that these

450
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">these two routes this one is green red</font>

451
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,820
and two blue routes now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

452
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">customer over here the earthlink network</font>

453
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,659
let's say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> only wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send the</font>

454
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,250
blue and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the green networks out so we</font>

455
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,160
simply use a route map and the cisco

456
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,110
parlance we filter on communities and so

457
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,020
we make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this red route is</font>

458
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,270
never propagated so as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw here</font>

459
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,860
going back one as you saw here basically

460
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,929
what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we assign routes and</font>

461
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,969
ingress and we filtered based on routes

462
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:51,440
and egress where it's very nicely so

463
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,929
some of the communities we finally

464
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,250
settled on in the structure or customer

465
00:18:53,929 --> 00:19:00,260
routes private peering transit and

466
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,450
public pairing and of course not all of

467
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,650
these are political to all the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs</font>

468
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,890
we're talking about here but we tried to

469
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:09,200
be general for internal routes we made

470
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,000
two distinctions we talked about

471
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,980
internal loads that we want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

472
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,900
globally visible and we talked about

473
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,480
internal routes that we wanted to be

474
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,429
visible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our OPN networks now mine</font>

475
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,760
spring we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of networks there</font>

476
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:24,980
were OPN providers to us other providers

477
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,570
networks we're their dial-up services

478
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,750
and we privately<font color="#CCCCCC"> peered with them and</font>

479
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:33,110
there were some circumstances where we

480
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,450
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restrict certain services to</font>

481
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,309
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers and not let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest</font>

482
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,190
of the world see them stuff like you

483
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:42,290
know outgoing smtp you know news or

484
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,210
radius servers we want to do is

485
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,210
announced only to our cells and to our

486
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,010
opians alone so you know kind of a

487
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,309
protection against abuse of the services

488
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,059
by non customers and with communities we

489
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,309
were allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

490
00:19:53,059 --> 00:20:02,450
certain routes for export out to those

491
00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">OPN providers alone okay another thing</font>

492
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,799
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> assigned communities based on were</font>

493
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,120
field versus exchange point peering in

494
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,980
other words we're going to privately

495
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">appear with someone and Tulsa Oklahoma</font>

496
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,639
they'd get this community if we were

497
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,860
going to appear with someone at a mayor

498
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:18,350
a nap they would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this community and</font>

499
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,479
of course we did it based on DC atlanta

500
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,969
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our headquarters is currently</font>

501
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,529
net<font color="#CCCCCC"> reals headquarters chicago palo alto</font>

502
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">dallas some of the major peering points</font>

503
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:30,499
furthermore there's some special

504
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,019
communities we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build and</font>

505
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:35,360
support for no export of course and no

506
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise are both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known bgp</font>

507
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,070
communities so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> built in support</font>

508
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,840
prefer me and avoid me our proposed

509
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known communities we wanted to</font>

510
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,090
build in support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well</font>

511
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,669
finally what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would do is we'd add a</font>

512
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,639
community string to represent the origin

513
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:56,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">a s number for example for a route that</font>

514
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:59,449
came from uunet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag it like this 400</font>

515
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:01,879
6701 if a route came from sprint would

516
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,980
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1239 on it that would help us do</font>

517
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:06,590
some filtering later in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer</font>

518
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,240
wanted a special load of routes in other

519
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,090
words they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> all routes except</font>

520
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:16,309
maybe uunet routes for local preference

521
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,209
let's go through this here<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

522
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:20,059
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different local</font>

523
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:23,860
preferences for our customers for

524
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:27,879
peering and for transit so let's say a

525
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:30,889
customer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours is advertising 165 200</font>

526
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:32,178
124 into our network now we're always

527
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,769
going to prefer customers right

528
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,470
generally in the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of local</font>

529
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:39,169
preference hierarchy customers then

530
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,840
transit and peering the reason why is

531
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:42,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">because obviously a customer comes first</font>

532
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,360
then we're generally going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

533
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,919
transit then we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use peering</font>

534
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,519
last we use trained at first because

535
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,600
we're paying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so local prep of 100</font>

536
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,779
we're going to set<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the customer</font>

537
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,779
route

538
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prefer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer</font>

539
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:14,410
round then for our views from say 290

540
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:18,310
and second preferred route because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

541
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,410
part of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> regional three favorite right</font>

542
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,450
now um you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use up that mantle</font>

543
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:25,270
first for that highest rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

544
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,350
kinda good right when I spoke a minute

545
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,240
ago about preferring train to Dover

546
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,300
pairing we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to by transat over</font>

547
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,790
public hearing in this case with 4006

548
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,100
with a local<font color="#E5E5E5"> prep of 90 we're talking</font>

549
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">about public pairing finally we go to</font>

550
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,540
transit with a local preference of 60

551
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw that in our routing table</font>

552
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:47,580
so you can see there we have three

553
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:50,139
possible ways to get to 165 200<font color="#E5E5E5"> L 1 / 24</font>

554
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,429
the way that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be preferred is</font>

555
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to be our customer route</font>

556
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,510
and you may say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is going to be</font>

557
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,389
preferred anyways look at the AS<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

558
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,440
well that's not always so simple what

559
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,780
happens if the customer starts

560
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,580
prepending greatly we want to ensure

561
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer is always going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

562
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,620
routed through our connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

563
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,620
customer

564
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay again in local preference the</font>

565
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,860
higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local preference the more</font>

566
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,539
desirable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to route customers always come</font>

567
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,969
first we never want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send their</font>

568
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:23,179
traffic to appear private peering is

569
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,649
more desirable than public pairing

570
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:29,880
transit is less desirable than private

571
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:31,768
peering for economic reasons so here is

572
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">the local preference hierarchy we</font>

573
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:36,330
decided on always<font color="#E5E5E5"> preferred and never</font>

574
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:38,010
preferred correspond to the proposed

575
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">well known communities we talked about</font>

576
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we have two choices for customer</font>

577
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,700

we actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the interface IP</font>

generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> use outbound soft</font>

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,539
reconfiguration you have to recognize

635
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,178
communities and of course filtering is

636
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:13,490
done on egress meds are set on ingress

637

638
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:19,440
basically here's why we like soft

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,360
reconfiguration of course clear IP bgp

640
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,620
is somewhat hostile to your network

641
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,260
stability soft out which is which is

642
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use here is a low</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu</font>

643
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,789
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it issues</font>

644
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,559
withdrawals for all advertised routes it

645
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:38,400
recompute sand then resends the routes

646
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,620
we did not want to use soft in when we

647
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,539
can control both peers because we're

648
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,120
essentially were we have to reevaluate

649
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,129
all the routes receive from<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer stored</font>

650
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,928
in memory high memory requirements

651
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,000
because we need to store that separately

652
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:52,500
so we burn up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of memory on the</font>

653
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,659
routers remember this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

consideration year's numbers we almost

sort of odd right well it's not

for the

658
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:10,230
right here's our<font color="#E5E5E5"> config basically what</font>

659
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,690
we do is was this is pretty

660
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,330
straightforward we use a peer group here

661
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:18,480
where we can we have to route maps

662
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:21,418
operationally here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inbound route</font>

663
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,669
map the received routes sets an additive

00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,710
med now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know meds</font>

665
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:27,450

meds in a slightly different way here

667
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,490
we're using meds is an actual routing

668
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:37,169
metric so what we do and this is legal

669
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">cisco syntax is when routes come in we</font>

670
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:42,000
add a certain additional metric to their

671
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,760
med and we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a way of</font>

672
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,880
determining louding so that could be set

673
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,809
metric plus 100 or set metric plus 200

674
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,179
which of course increments<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Med it's</font>

675
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:56,940
also perfectly legal if you wanted to do

676
00:27:54,179 --> 00:28:00,330
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like said metric minus 200 it</font>

677
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,250
can be plus or minus now when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center</font>

678

701
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,130
basically you could have many situations

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,658
where you have the same local prep so

703
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,120
let's say it's all peering let's say you

<font color="#CCCCCC">pee or someone in four points so the</font>

708
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:09,059
try to balance that outbound a little

709
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:10,980
bit balance it in some kind of

710
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:13,710
meaningful way well we can set these

711
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,380
meds based on same mileage or based on

712
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,050
delay in milliseconds

713
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:20,810
so we can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay send that traffic to</font>

714
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,639
the nearest pier rather than just either

randomly chosen or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2p or the lowest</font>

716
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,900
router ID that way it can help us to

717
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,850
balance our outbound traffic a little

718
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,560
bit hopefully pleasing our peers and

719
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,199
pleasing ourselves because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

an igp it works if you underlie with an

approaches that work between these pops

you don't have to run any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of igp</font>

769
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:09,419
between them you can simply have say

ospf running an area 0 here<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ospf</font>

everything

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:34,920
hey it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fairly</font>

777
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,650
impressive of course you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're doing some early operational</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tests</font>

783
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,480
like whoa I've damp and help my pops out

784
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,979
so you don't want to be damned thing

785
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,440
your own routes if say one of the

786

interfaces inside your network flats for

787
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,740
some reason okay then you could

788
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,680
essentially black hole one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pops</font>

789
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,720
but the convergence time here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

790
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,520
was very favorable and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

791
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,890
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool about the convergence time</font>

792
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,940
is it's as good as ospf and the other

793
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,580
nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry</font>

794
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,470
about ospf scaling concerns that's the

other<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice thing we can keep all</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of you know all of our extra routes</font>

outside of ospf in a mine spring where

798
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:23,460
we had lots and lots of externals I was

<font color="#E5E5E5">very useful for transit peers this is</font>

800
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,210
this is somewhat of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different story</font>

if we want to we can do is pass prevents

transit providers there's a couple

863
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,300
transit tricks we ran across while

864
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:57,850
developing this including deep referring

865
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,619
routes for congested outbound we've used

866
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:01,630
this pretty successfully this doesn't

867
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:04,180
just work with transit this can work

868
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,250
with peering in some ways basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

869
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,740
we'll do is we'll a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> well deeper for</font>

870
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:12,100
routes by setting local pref lower based

871
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:14,589
on a s path length will have an AAS path

872
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,109
regular expression that will save for

873
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:20,650
path<font color="#E5E5E5"> length</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 or 2 set the local press</font>

874
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:24,880
normally force AAS path length of 3 or

875
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:27,609
greater d preference have a lower local

876
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,740
preference what that does is if you have

877
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:32,259
transit that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> force that outbound</font>

878
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:35,049
traffic out other transit connections

879
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:37,510
that have a higher local press for a s

880
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,240
path went<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and greater that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

881
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,190
nice way of dealing even if you

882
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,379
use Confederations this is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice</font>

883
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,360
way of dealing with congested outbound

884
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,280
peering or transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about</font>

885
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,990
peering and transit there is let's see

886
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,820
if it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just appear in connection and</font>

887
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,129
you also have transit you can use this

888
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,560
trick to say okay for really

889
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,570
advantageous stuff for the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

890
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">routes we knew that peering connection</font>

891
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,560
for the stuff that's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of yeah so so</font>

892
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,390
anyways we're going to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff</font>

893
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,770
out to transit and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hope it finds</font>

894
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:10,230
its way home so let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now 40</font>

895
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,820
pins and sending OPN routes again we

896
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,910
have some provisions in here since

897
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,590
special communities for folks who use

898
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,109
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> outsource dial-up lots and lots</font>

899
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:23,300
of us do so with some special provisions

900
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:25,530
in here for sending routes out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPM's</font>

901
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,960
basically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our section on public</font>

902
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:30,150
and private peers the again the update

903
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,520
source for these bgp sessions is the

904
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,660
facing interface soft reconfiguration

905
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,610
all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very familiar</font>

906
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:40,020
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like transit you know</font>

907
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,390
and again here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as we</font>

908
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,859
said before to use local preference to

909
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,569
force everything to that pier that

910
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,910
should go to the pier or we can deep

911
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:51,660
refer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shift some outbound to transit</font>

912
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:56,250
providers you know this is again very

913
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,109
similar you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know again we're the main</font>

914
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,940
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're only a cent</font>

915
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,310
customer routes out there's a slightly

916
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,260
different route map that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font>

917
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,029
this is appearing connection rather than

918
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,650
than this being a transit connection

919
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,570
again we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send out only</font>

920
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,980
customer and internal routes and none of

921
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">these other routes that we don't send</font>

922
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,030
out customer peers are a little bit

923
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,460
different this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where it gets</font>

924
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,900
interesting all this stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

925
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,100
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we only control one side of the</font>

926
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:25,650
one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the relationship here</font>

927
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,029
communities must be recognized now this

928
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,160
includes community sent from the

929
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,080
customers according<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea this setup</font>

930
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,060
is that our customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> can send to some</font>

931
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,920
of these communities and set their own

932
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">local preference that kind of thing in</font>

933
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,650
other words if they want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know these</font>

934
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,359
rods to be backup routes and these

935
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:42,240
rights to be primary routes they can

936
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,069
send us communities to that effect we

937
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,950
can send only selected routes based on

938
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,450
customer requests that way if they want

939
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,629
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Union at traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

940

the unit and doesn't go through our our

941
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,700
autonomous system for some reason

942
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,160
like some significant prepending at some

943
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,899
point they can make sure that we can say

944
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,430
okay we're only going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font>

947
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,319
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply a CLS to</font>

949
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:12,670
apply import filters that only except

950
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:13,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific customer routes now that's</font>

951
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,640
different from what we do with our

952
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,349
transit providers and our peering

953
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,118
partners we essentially accepted

954
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:21,069
anything they're going to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us here</font>

955
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,730
we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put some import filters</font>

956
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:26,950
on and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend using RT config to</font>

957
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,390
query right arbiter database and

958
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:33,939
automatically generate the access

959
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:35,790
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists now this will be pretty</font>

can send we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send for routes which</font>

called a partial view as writers to

we feel that using a s numbers to filter

is kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with fire</font>

customers do not have to advertise the

00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,919
same routes everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers do that's</font>

1008
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,169
one of the biggest misapprehensions we

1009
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:27,328
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into talk to an odd guy or something</font>

1010
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:28,828
they're telling a customer hey you have

1011
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">to advertise the same routes everywhere</font>

1012
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:32,909
no no customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do whatever they</font>

1013
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:35,279
want to they can advertise little tiny

1014
00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:37,439
tiny pieces of routes they can advertise

1015
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:39,359
big blocks they can advertise different

1016
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:40,699
things in different pops peers have to

1017
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,019
advertise the same thing everywhere

1018
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:45,719
customers don't now that isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

1019
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:47,098
that we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> guarantee that any</font>

1020
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:49,469
block the advertiser is going to be

1021
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,729
globally routable we won't do that and

1022
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:54,989
we'll tell them we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1023
00:41:50,729 --> 00:41:58,408
advertise say I / 29 29 we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1024
00:41:54,989 --> 00:42:00,569
to propagate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but if they have a /</font>

1025
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:03,149
18 and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carve that up into /</font>

1026
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:05,009
22 s you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and they want to do them</font>

1027
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:06,808
in different pops you know because let's

1028
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:09,059
say they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a way in backing up</font>

1029
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:12,049
behind that they want to run isolated

1030
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:14,399
ebgp we're going to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them do it</font>

1031
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:16,049
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> for customer configuration for</font>

1032
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,479
full routes will run through these

1033
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:20,699
pretty quick these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty similar</font>

1034
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:22,919
there's an import filter as you notice

1035
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:25,079
we switch to junos you know we're equal

1036
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:27,929
opportunity offenders here you know we

1037
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,609
we rag on iOS long enough so now it's

1038
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:33,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">junos has turned for little dose of the</font>

punishment<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically vision there's can</font>

1040
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:38,098
you go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> one basically there's no</font>

1041
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:40,759
export filter or<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving them all the</font>

1042
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:43,739
routes we got we have an import filter

1043
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:46,289
the convention we use is the city like

1044
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:49,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Atlanta and my co would be my company</font>

1045
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:51,719
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept these two routes</font>

1046
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:53,639
and only those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two routes of course this</font>

1047
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:57,629
could be automatically generated pretty

1048
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:59,879
easily from RT config here this is what

1049
00:42:57,629 --> 00:43:03,169
we're accepting from them customer named

1050
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:06,359
ash<font color="#CCCCCC"> n we set a local preference</font>

1051
00:43:03,169 --> 00:43:08,368
community strings etc and on a Juniper

1052
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,739
here it's much easier to see this is a

1053
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:12,809
customer this is not an exchange point

1054
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:14,669
this is in Atlanta and that's the

1055
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:16,589
customer name so the communities are

1056
00:43:14,669 --> 00:43:19,629
much more obvious

1057
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:21,489
cultural routes is exactly the same the

1058
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">only difference is we're only exporting</font>

1059
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:25,959
customer routes in other words we're

1060
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,269
saying you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to now</font>

going to be internal routes customer

1064
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:36,640
outs and customer backup routes you know

1065
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:39,189
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna send our rods we got</font>

1066
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,098
from peers or anything like that finally

1067
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:43,989
default route only I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

command on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juniper it's a little</font>

1072
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:54,670
more complex you have to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of build a</font>

1073
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,469
default route for the customer and shoot

1074
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,660
it out to them the way you do that is

1075
00:43:56,469 --> 00:44:01,839
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks pretty standard</font>

1076
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:04,839
this is a pretty standard customer bgp

1077
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,699
peer group but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an export policy</font>

1078
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,430
statement called default<font color="#E5E5E5"> originated</font>

1079
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:11,769
which we just made up and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1080
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing is we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to insert us we</font>

1081
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:16,328
only have to do this part once we make a

1082
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:18,130
static route and most of us run do you

1083
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:20,589
faultless networks but we have to put

1084
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,390
one in and then not install it as a

1085
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:24,699
route and go back one and then not

1086
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:26,410
install it is around we make the next

1087
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:30,719
hop the loopback address of our router

1088
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:33,939
then as we export it we take that route

1089
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,219
we're activating it as we do this we set

1090
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:40,118
the next top cell in other words we make

1091
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:42,279
the next hop<font color="#CCCCCC"> our router interface we</font>

1092
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,380
accept it it goes out so there we've

1093
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:47,049
just invented default originated on the

1094
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:50,890
juniper we don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have too</font>

1095
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:54,579
many you know chances to use that any

1096
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:56,890
questions who rented is pretty quick so

1097
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:59,349
if anybody has<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

1098
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,529
go back talk about this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to</font>

1099
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:01,529
make sense

1100
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,930
additive communities but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1101
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:13,380
not really an issue because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're again</font>

1102
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:16,118
we're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding communities in ingress</font>

1103
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,040
but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if we just strip</font>

1104
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,020
communities and didn't do additive

1105
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,970
communities we lose the communities our

1106
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,259
customers are sending us and that we

1107
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:27,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the</font>

1108
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,210
communities that our customers send us

1109
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:34,990
we don't currently so you know maybe if

1110
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,569
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we we all get together richest</font>

1112
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,500
signaling some kind of reserved

1113
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:44,560
communities we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send us the</font>

secret Lodge sign between ISPs that

1115
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,720
might be useful but right now we don't

1116
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,190
see a huge great utility you know that

1117
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of lends itself to to sort of</font>

1118
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:55,000
one-off solutions between individual

1119
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,400
peers and we really wanted to

1120
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,290
standardize we made a document behind

1121
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,480
this you know this presentation is

1122
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:03,430
pretty shallow but the document find

1123
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,200
this is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 pages and we're going</font>

1124
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:08,140
to publish it to the web as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

that's right you stand up and repeat

1196
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:51,609
that are the design doesn't actually

1197

this miguel i mean it's it's simply more

of a fairness issue for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> piers to</font>

ensure that routes aren't going to get

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,230
you know have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> traverse the piers</font>

1207
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:18,910
network and inordinate amount you know

1208
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,410
it's a fairness issue to make sure it's

1209
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:29,230
going to traverse our network<font color="#CCCCCC"> an equal</font>

1210
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:31,299
amount yeah at some point you know it

1211
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:33,790
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> economic sense to actually</font>

00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,910
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> during connections at some point</font>

1213
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:38,800
it might be more cost effective to spend

00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:42,129
it out there transiently it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1215
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,599
depend for example if you had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pier in</font>

1216
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:47,079
connection we only had one period

1217
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:51,790
connection with company a in New York

1218
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:53,980
but and you get its route I mean you may

1219
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:57,190
or may not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propagate it's rough</font>

1221
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:01,690
your your backbone because it might it

1222
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,328
might be more cost effective to just

1223
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:07,510
send it out through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle transit</font>

1224
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:11,980
there are cases where in that's true and

1225
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:15,310
educates we may decide to just restrict

1226
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:17,440
the passing of the period rods women or

1227
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:19,299
keeping it within a region you know

1228
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,670
that's well there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing the</font>

1229
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,290
community structure lets us do it is

1230
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're strict outs in a regional manner</font>

1231
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:27,640
but to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Phillips question</font>

1232
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,680
let's see it appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York and</font>

1233
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,299
appear in Los Angeles let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1234
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,710
they were announcing different routes

1235
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,940
how there's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure in</font>

1236
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,680
connections let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say they were</font>

1237
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:38,260
announcing all of their routes out in LA

1238
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,419
and only some in New York let's say in

1239
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:43,630
your new york

1240
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:45,190
you had some traffic for them but in it

1241
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:46,840
but it's not one of the routes that's

1242
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:50,020
being announced to you in that specific

1243
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:52,090
location well on your dime on my dime I

1244
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:54,759
have to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that traffic all the way</font>

across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country to LA in order for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the other person's network and</font>

1247
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:01,270
then go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as I really the point</font>

1248
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">appearing I shouldn't have to pay to</font>

1249
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:05,230
send that outbound traffic all the way

1250
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:07,689
across my network generally to deal with

1251
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,790
outbound is you know we can dump it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

1252
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:12,010
at the closest point and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person</font>

1253
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:14,350
on the other side pays the the long haul

1254
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:15,760
costs involved you know if that's one

1255
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:18,370
reason why inbound is considered to be

1256
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,310
so much more desirable because inbound

1257
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:23,440
traffic is going to traverse the other

1258
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:43,870
guys network and it's not going to be

1259
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:46,000
traversing across your network I can see

1260
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:48,069
situations where you might the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we</font>

1261
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,960
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this way is</font>

1262
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:52,750
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is essentially just what</font>

1263
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,280
they do in America<font color="#E5E5E5"> for pairing you know</font>

1264
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">their arguments you can make one way or</font>

1265
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,340
the other but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

1266
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:59,319
there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what was standard</font>

1267
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,930
and that's what was expected of peers

1268
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:03,940
the expectant appears that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce</font>

1269
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:11,980
your routes the same at every parent

1270
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:15,850
connection so other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't</font>

1271
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for ya yeah but</font>

1272
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:20,259
basically the question was there was a

1273
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,150
lot of feedback of the last NOC<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a</font>

presentation about prefer me and avoid

me there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were some security concerns we</font>

1276
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:31,299
didn't put a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thinking</font>

00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:33,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">about those whose particular concerns on</font>

1280
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an issue and that</font>

00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,290
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use it to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess and</font>

1282
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:47,410
do supremely suboptimal routing and

1283
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:48,640
someone else's net blocks but not I have

1284
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:51,240
to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really been an issue</font>

1285
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,240
we've considered

1286
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,430
no we don't so what we have now it was

1287
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,140
kind of going to be used as an internal

1288
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing as you can see what we didn't</font>

1289
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:04,308
really implement it much but one of the

1290
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:06,079
efforts we made in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we that</font>

1291
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:07,700
we only really wanted to do this once so

1292
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to put as many hooks in as</font>

1293
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible as many different possibilities</font>

1294
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:15,440
as we possibly could that way we get

1295
00:54:12,859 --> 00:54:18,049
greater flexibility but we don't

1296
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:23,049
anticipate a huge need<font color="#E5E5E5"> for prefer me and</font>

1297
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:23,049
avoid me in this context other questions

1298
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:59,340
what that means tackle you in with no I

1299
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:01,140
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we did actually remember</font>

1300
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:04,590
there's a difference here between the

1301
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:07,859
bgp sub a s numbers and the communities

1302
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:09,540
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're kind of juxtaposing the</font>

1303
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,790
two we can put whatever community

1304
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:14,040
strings we want on the routes when we

1305
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:16,200
put 65,000 on there that's not a

1306
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:28,290
community string that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a confederation</font>

1307
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:31,589
sub a s number right well for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1308
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:36,180
particular I guess you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there in</font>

1309
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:40,140
that tent no we thought we put 65,000 as

1310
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:43,680
the as the community string also because

1311
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:47,069
we wanted to be able to use the aah

1312
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,799
members of the of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> our transit</font>

1313
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:54,780
appears as part of the community provide

1314
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:58,050
water for all six and one with me it was

1315
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:02,880
a Robeson strongly in life but it is an

1316
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:05,460
interesting point there of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ADA</font>

1317
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,840
projects so many people might neither

1318
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,660
are companies of the huge international

1319
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:12,810
strategy which probably was portrayed in

1320
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,740
the in this sort of thing so but we can

1321
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:17,310
put that in that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

1322
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:19,700
fascinating point country codes so we'll

1323
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,700
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that away</font>

1324
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:27,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of inference knowing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1325
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:29,549
promise you / web show sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds</font>

1326
00:56:27,749 --> 00:56:33,569
good we went to when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> win a cable and</font>

1327
00:56:29,549 --> 00:56:45,829
wireless who sent it so any other

1328
00:56:33,569 --> 00:56:48,900
questions comments that work right now

1329
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:51,079
no I was really using is<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-stop of</font>

1330
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:55,369
course p.m. so we do we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have a</font>

1331
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:58,680
a backbone an area 0 through our network

1332
00:56:55,369 --> 00:57:03,089
but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having that</font>

1333
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:06,210
separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> preferred related area 0 for</font>

1334
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:18,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">pop we have none yeah just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to fix</font>

1335
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a scaling issue yes who did that was</font>

1336
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:28,049
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on there yeah you bet what</font>

1337
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing that and the reason we're</font>

1338
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:31,799
doing that is because from some of our

1339
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:34,200
biggest peers some some peering points

1340
00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:35,999
we get meds and some peering points for

1341
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,460
the exact same routes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get any</font>

1342
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,229
meds so until folks can kind of put

1343
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,150
their heads together and figure out a

1344
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:44,430
good way of looking at meds now we do

1345
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,809
listen for meds from our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1346
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:47,640
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference because you know</font>

1347
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:49,680
we can call our customer and say hey

1348
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,749
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something weird so if it's</font>

1349
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:56,328
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> leveraged thing it's a layer 8 kind of</font>

1350
00:57:51,749 --> 00:57:56,328
issue so

1351
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:07,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Federation's one of the advantages</font>

1352
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:15,980
with a lot of throwback detectives with

1353
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:17,300
new year old no<font color="#CCCCCC"> note it really didn't</font>

1354
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:20,060
have anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with customer</font>

1355
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:22,010
routers we phoned to drive extra route

1356
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:27,049
reflectors because they work best on an

1357
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:29,300
ATM network fully meshed and we felt it

1358
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">was the possibility of isolating pops</font>

1359
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:37,670
from rare reflector service even<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1360
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:42,229
this setup yes you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to set up</font>

1361
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:44,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">your filters for peer really is not</font>

1362
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:48,740
much difference if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look like a</font>

1363
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:53,020
superhero yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure horse customers</font>

1364
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:56,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">bits in to say it was more go with the</font>

1365
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:59,480
the isolation right it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> survive</font>

1366
00:58:56,869 --> 00:59:01,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">write it with a survivability issue when</font>

1367
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,280
you don't have ATM to do redirects when

1368
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:06,410
you have a packet over<font color="#CCCCCC"> SONET Network</font>

1369
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,690
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no there's no rerouting going on</font>

1370
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,799
and necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we wanted to do</font>

1371
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:21,430
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1372
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:21,430
survivable<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network right</font>

1373
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:29,130
ed up technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet I have to</font>

1374
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">admit that i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge optical guy so</font>

1375
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:34,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can't fully address that my director</font>

1376
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,810
of optical transport engineering though

1377
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:38,970
tells me wonderful things about optical

1378
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:41,549
switches that we can use in some of the

1379
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:44,009
same manner that folks used ATM switches

1380
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:46,980
for to essentially make it look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1381
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:48,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a full mesh in certain cities now</font>

1382
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,610
our plane was not to deploy those

1383
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:53,190
everywhere mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the intense</font>

1384
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:55,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost or that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of hardware we were</font>

1385
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:57,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy it say you know in</font>

1386
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,250
our hub hearing cities so it would look

1387
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,960
like there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full mesh between the</font>

1388
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,490
hub<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering cities even though of course</font>

1389
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,230
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the fiber route miles</font>

1390
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:06,120
between them but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the high</font>

1391
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost we still need something like the</font>

1392
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,130
Confederation approach to go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1393
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:28,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the you know ad pops that aren't in</font>

1394
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:32,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hub cities or and she just say</font>

1395
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:35,529
the land straight out straight into a

1396
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:39,369
layer in taste the nice thing about this

1397
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:42,490
approach is it works either way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1398
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:45,099
lose anything if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the the optical</font>

1399
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:47,500
switches we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we don't gain anything</font>

1400
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:49,720
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have them it's pretty much a</font>

1401
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:52,299
wash it<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe improve the stability of</font>

1402
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,480
it a little bit if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

1403
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:57,160
rear out capability but in this kind of

1404
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,710
approach layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three handles it just</font>

1405
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:02,020
fine and when layer one kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of catches</font>

1406
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:07,140
up with that knee technology will still

1407
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:07,140
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so other questions</font>

1408
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:39,170
oh don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get meds same as you do with</font>

1409
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">any other kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp right we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

1410
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,980
actually set the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Med per se the Met is</font>

1411
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:45,950
going to be set through the additive med

1412
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:48,680
kind of scheme so they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

1413
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,609
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> med if they want to yeah so that's</font>

1414
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,490
basically it's going if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1415
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:56,690
inject routes into our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1416
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:58,609
different meds you know we can yeah look

1417
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:01,579
good they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them based on</font>

1418
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:03,288
this they'll see our mats and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill be</font>

1419
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:05,059
meaningful meds because it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be based</font>

1420
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:06,859
on delay or mileage or stuff like that

1421
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:15,490
so the meds will actually be useful for

1422
01:02:06,859 --> 01:02:15,490
them we hope other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions comments</font>

1423
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:21,200
summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me just summarize</font>

1424
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:22,700
real quick we're at here<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what</font>

1425
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,410
we feel this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Confederation</font>

1426
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,930
approach gives us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of key</font>

1427
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:29,058
benefits one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> is less complexity</font>

1428
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:32,598
that was a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> one for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us greater</font>

1429
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:34,549
stability more flexibility for traffic

1430
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:38,000
management for those additive meds

1431
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:41,180
greater survivability with the papas

1432
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,279
Confederation approach lower engineering

1433
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:45,140
and administrative costs mostly thanks

1434
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:47,269
to our community structure you know we

1435
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:50,180
have you know fewer<font color="#CCCCCC"> lengths of guys</font>

1436
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:53,959
typing in you know filter list and AAS

1437
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:56,149
pathless increased up time going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1438
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">the greater survivability and we feel</font>

1439
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:00,140
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to let it spilled you know</font>

1440
01:02:58,009 --> 01:03:03,019
at both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our networks a scalable</font>

1441
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:05,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">next-generation IP network any final</font>

1442
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:09,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions well thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys for coming</font>

1443
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:09,009
out tonight we appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>
