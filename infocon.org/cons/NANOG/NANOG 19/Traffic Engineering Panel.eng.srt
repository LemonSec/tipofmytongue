00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:08,940
we did a panel a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes ago I can't</font>

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember how many about basic traffic</font>

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,590
doing on the network and supposedly on

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,410
various people's comments forms they

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,869
decided they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see more and in</font>

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,948
theory my name came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and I curse you</font>

8
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:29,630
all for it so we're here back again with

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,219
different people and a different setting

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,960
this presentation kind of changed

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,380
midstream because at first we were going

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,090
to do it as a traffic engineering

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,309
working group out of the ICS and we were

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,050
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present the framework document</font>

15
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,328
and what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on networking groups</font>

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,750
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get some operational inputs</font>

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,719
and midstream we decided to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:55,079
interim meeting here but setting here on

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,510
Wednesday so we're kind of shifted the

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,010
focus because we didn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to absorb a</font>

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,300
whole hour during that if we are going

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spend a good part of wednesday so it</font>

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,798

an example of mpls backbone architecture

85
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:02,750
probably best to start with where we are

86
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from back in 98 was when we</font>

87
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,260
started offering services and we

88
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,430
deployed a ATM network over which we

89
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,820
[Music]

90
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:16,460
deployed a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different virtual</font>

91
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,840
networks across it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we had routers</font>

92
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,060
that were dedicated to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our internet</font>

93
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,299
service routers dedicated to our

94
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,590
internal and management networks and

95
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,810
routers that were dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our voice</font>

96
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,960
products and they all basically add all

97
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:34,090
their own independent PVC meshes across

98
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,888
that the reasons why we did that is

99
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,119
because even though we're facility

100
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network it takes a long time to get all</font>

101
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,440
the fiber out there so we're leasing

102
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,060
capacity and it allowed us to get one

103
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,270
big pipe and put all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our traffic on</font>

104
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:52,039
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to some extent be wrong about</font>

105
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,870
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to be it</font>

106
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,180
also isolates the different networks in

107
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,490
terms of routing and qos and things like

108
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:03,289
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what do you know it's pretty</font>

109
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost effective the reason why we're</font>

110
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:09,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">moving away from ATM was because the</font>

111
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,489
capacity of our little<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASX one thousands</font>

112
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,889
had had long been exceeded so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

113
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,750
do something the decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with</font>

114
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,830
packet over sonet was was mostly because

115
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,410
that's what's out there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

116
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,289
marketplace now we still wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

117
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,590
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi service network you know we</font>

118
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:30,080
still are leasing in a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> portion of</font>

119
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,110
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so it does make it very</font>

120
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,900
effective to have all your capacity

121
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:38,300
basically in one basket we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to be</font>

122
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,468
able to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer VPN product</font>

123
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:47,240
which to some extent indicated that we

124
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:51,520
would need a virtual network approach or

125
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:54,620
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> end mpls and I using things like RFC</font>

126
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,110
2547 or however those numbers go

127
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:00,269
together we wanted a scalable

128
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,790
design of course something that's more

129
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:05,010
manageable or easy to manage than an ATM

130
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,769
mesh network as a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here are</font>

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,990
probably familiar with one of phones

132
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:12,450
with 18 mesh networks is got a lot of

133
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,950
ATM<font color="#E5E5E5"> PVCs you got to keep track of when</font>

134
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,930
you add a new network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a big</font>

135
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,980
task ahead of you in terms of touching

136
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,239
every other writer in the network and

137
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,870
also we wanted to make effective use of

138
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:31,130
complex topologies what we came up with

139
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that we had already came up with a</font>

140
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,610
hierarchy a transmission hierarchy

141
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,170
between our different gateways some

142
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,709
gateways gateway connections were at

143
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:43,410
higher capacity than others and we

144
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:45,089
continued that by making those become

145
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,980
the highest capacity packet over sonet

146
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,800
links and that's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do our traffic</font>

engineering we use our<font color="#CCCCCC"> SP we use a for</font>

RSVP traffic engineered mesh Tanner

149
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,750
connect all the routers and then we are

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,890
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side note backup LSPs to</font>

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,769
speed up convergence around failures in

155
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:18,660
the network and like I said it's

156
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:23,010
currently only an IP network with a RSVP

157
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:25,140
traffic engineered subset probably and

158
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,350
that's where almost all the traffic is

159
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:32,399
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are working on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp roll</font>

out over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next couple months how</font>

161
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:41,670
those will interact is if this works is

162
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:43,229
in this area where the red blob is ldd

163
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,899
will be used to pull in traffic from the

164
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">gateways or from sites like st. Louis</font>

179
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:38,550
site we would use LBP to pull in traffic

for instance from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Houston into Dallas or</font>

194
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:26,279
so in this particular case<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure I'll</font>

195
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:30,060
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides available but for later</font>

204
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,010
so that's basically out all works

together sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> there'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions on</font>

207
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,480
believe a unique approach on how to use

<font color="#CCCCCC">the protocols together</font>

about it

210
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:22,839
so from an example where the majority or

00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:27,910
I guess all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the vector graphic is</font>

215
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,949
probably characterize it if you know

216
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,310

228
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:36,860
about our experiences using mpls like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

229
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:39,469
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't use it as much as I do on</font>

230
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:46,760
it it's wide to Eleanor backbone we use

231
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:48,890
it basically as we need to to uh make up

232
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,560
make up for the lack of what facilities

233
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:54,040
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP doesn't provide we've been</font>

234
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,760
running in our network for about a year

235
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:01,969
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was implemented because Isis was</font>

236
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,779
not sufficient enough to meet all of our

237
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:08,480
needs basically it just allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

238
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,520
control traffic flows and we get

239
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,500
congestion in busy areas that's most of

240
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:18,649
what we use it for like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said we use it</font>

241
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:25,300
as a last resort as opposed to primary

242
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:28,459
means of traffic engineering basically

243
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:35,120
it does allow exclusively<font color="#CCCCCC"> write a pass</font>

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,910
when we deployed it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> experienced a few</font>

256
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,990

258
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,880
fairly poorly because we have to

259
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,209
manually configure tunnels whenever the

260
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,280
need arises and we have to keep track of

261
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:43,579
where all those tunnels are

262
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:46,470
provide like external documentation and

engineering in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> key networks or so what</font>

296
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,859
is internet traffic engineering are

297
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,950
basically a beautifully performance

298
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,928
optimization of operational networks and

299
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:14,519
I'll talk a little bit about what i mean

300
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:16,320
by optimization in small bursts light it

301
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,470
is an application of technology and

302
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,619
scientific principles traffic

303
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,989

304
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:29,249
of traffic attributes and network

305
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:33,809
parameters are illustrated unajua

306
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:36,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">controls so siiii is nobody specific to</font>

307
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:38,850
any particular technology you basically

308
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to make use of the most appropriate</font>

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:46,769
technology at any point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time or so</font>

310
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,220
they can be accomplished in many

311
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:52,619
different ways and the matter that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

312
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,710
choose will probably depend on the kind

313
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:58,139
of business model that you have the kind

314
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,769
of technologies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are available as</font>

315
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:05,519
well as kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> insights but you have</font>

316
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:08,570
intermodal fundamental problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> clip</font>

317
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:12,289
engineering will evolve over time as

318
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:15,178
technology evolves as we get better

319
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:19,950
understanding of some of the fundamental

320
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:22,919
issues so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is optimization in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">calc engineering context clearly is not</font>

325
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,429
a mental control problem and the basic

326
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:41,489
problem is really you have capacity and

327
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:45,450
you're clever demand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic issue</font>

328
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:47,789
is to map the demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> capacity</font>

329
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,430
and the most effective way to deliver

330
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:53,360
the highest level

331
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:55,850
service to your customers are perfect

332
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,300
marine is a very complicated problem if

333
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:03,340
you want to do it very well as some of

334
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:07,850
these complications arise from two basic

335
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:11,149
aspects one is the IP traffic or IP

336
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:14,810
network optimization problem operates

337
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:17,660
over multiple time scales and also you

338
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:22,490
have various granularities of traffic

339
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:24,410
resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> allocations so coming from a</font>

340
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,290

342
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:33,170
relate capacity planning for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

343
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:35,380
as well as control over the world in

344
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:38,270

intermediate<font color="#CCCCCC"> timescale control problem</font>

346
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:45,110
you also have very very short time scale

of these problems rather than from the

dead after delay after what I suspect

408
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,419
leaks are really as ineffective as

409
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,480
they're supposed to be an odd happy to

should see this

00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:01,200
then we have the class globally models

to be very useful for both optimization

as well as for one grant planning better

engineering systematically in a network

458
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:16,130
one of the merits is that it allows you

to structure your goals and<font color="#E5E5E5"> priorities</font>

terrific concepts for track engineering

468
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,950
basically you can have policies that are

548
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:53,170
was that in a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large dense and this</font>

is when I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing my unit hat even</font>

though I no longer work for them the

552
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,700
like Venus to do the huge amounts of

553
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,310
traffic we had internally it was

554
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,830
basically impossible to calculate out in

555
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,139
any reasonable time frame what to set

556
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:14,740
the global metrics to before adding new

557
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,930

of issues congestion as Daniel

566
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:42,310
years down within the network which is a

567
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:46,180
non-trivial amount of traffic so most of

568
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:49,149
our deaf people doing Rick glazier here

569
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,070
we're sitting around working metrics up

570
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:53,380
and down trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what the</font>

571
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,179
optimal paths work so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

572
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,250
decided instead of putting it all on the

573
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,040
humans we should try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> automate it as</font>

574
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:02,050
much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we possibly can and put in PVC</font>

575
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,970
contracts and ATM networks which at that

576
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:08,600
point where traffic engineered using

00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:11,750
pnni spans first<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth</font>

578
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,929
yes and then basically what what

579
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:17,300
involved was we have a set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all meshes</font>

580
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,610
core region and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> twentieth region</font>

581
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,050
which is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> full match this olivia is</font>

582
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,810
the M Squared machine problem because we

583
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:25,730
did not have edge to edge measures and

584
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:29,659
then basically we sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our behalf for</font>

585
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:32,060
switches and<font color="#CCCCCC"> debt BBC contracts by</font>

587
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,850

they were the Super the<font color="#E5E5E5"> super flows hub</font>

the difficulty that Brenda had reported

00:49:56,779 --> 00:50:04,039
with scaling these technical LSPs could

926
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,940
you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit about the control problem</font>

927
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:06,740
that you have with you on that

928
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:09,680
recognized in particular that you can

929
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:11,180
idea about the scale in terms of the

930
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,640
number of LSPs or the number of labels

931
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:15,470
you have and what sort of percentage of

932
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,500
those are manually configured this is

933
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:19,848
automatically generated somehow yeah

934
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,380
that's that was something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was thinking</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was listening to Brenda</font>

936
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:29,180
talk I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one potential difference is</font>

937
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:32,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're coming out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

938
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,710
full mesh ATM network so we've got a lot

939
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:36,140
of configuration systems that are used

940
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:37,970
to doing things like generating these

941
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:43,220
types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> zon these type of</font>

942
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:45,558
configurations and so I we have a lot

943
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,939
more automated configuration control i

944
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:47,680
guess and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's and probably another</font>

945
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,410
reason why we

00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,180
full mesh abilities to clean our wide

947
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,589
area network routers because it's

948
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably more easy to do that than to</font>

949
00:50:53,589 --> 00:51:01,058
decide which L speak to deploy so and in

950
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of scale I guess we had like 10 or</font>

951
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:05,500
11 gateways up there each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them have</font>

952
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:07,210
to land routers and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> mesh so</font>

953
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:11,079
whatever that comes out to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

955
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:20,770
again Brenda's use of LSPs was primarily

956
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:23,589
for routes that will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> show its path</font>

how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your LSPs do not go on sort</font>

of smart friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> none of them you can't</font>

sound so this is the nice touting part

go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your way to deploy mpls just</font>

977
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:28,030
because other people are doing it just

978
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,070
because you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cool or just</font>

979
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:31,990
because you have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to do it's</font>

00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:36,700
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessary and probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety</font>

buying the fiber in the first place the

985
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:48,160
reason you do it more or less is because

986
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,870
you're waiting for install intervals or

00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:03,730
because it is a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more you're adding</font>

know being that ambiguous they love a

1027
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,790
fully nailed up this is this is where

1028
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:45,000
all the pasco this is how much traffic

1029

they can carry they love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pieces so</font>

1030
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,390
that might be a force down and for some

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just carrying IP traffic isn't</font>

that I a separate network still might be

that that loves it and I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

1045
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,310
serves a purpose but if there is a

1046
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:39,029
purpose in about ten percent or less of

1047
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:41,070
networks but we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to document why</font>

1048
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:44,040
people need<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and why they're using it</font>

1049
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:45,450
so we can give the vendors and various

00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,090
people and understanding on what needs

1051
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:52,560
to get what needs to get built into the

1052
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:54,770
system I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the vendors</font>

no I figured just 11 hidden thing in

00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:18,899
there is enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay putting my co-chair</font>

hat back on if you end up you know

1059
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:25,030
deploying a system we know and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1060
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:26,829
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the</font>

1061
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,720
same questions I ask the folks up here

1062
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:32,440
what's the problem set you're trying to

1063
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:35,348
fix what type of you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope did</font>

1064
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,210
you employ the system the problems you

1065
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:39,069
had during the deployment you know

1066
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:41,710
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> back after you do it was it</font>

1067
00:56:39,069 --> 00:56:43,630
worth the trouble deploying it the

1068
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,060
overall upkeep of the system is it

1069
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:47,770
easier or harder to maintain

1070
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:51,880
operationally and would you do it again

1071
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:55,180
looking back and the most important

1072
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:59,349
slide please<font color="#E5E5E5"> flush those common forms so</font>

1073
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:01,690
he still has those comments worms<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1074
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:05,180
ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> that crazy person sitting over</font>

1075
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:09,809
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks that's it have your life</font>

1077
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:14,759
thanks for the speakers including DJ

1078
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:16,650
right this is just one question I keep

1079
00:57:14,759 --> 00:57:19,170
hearing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic engineering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

1080
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:21,420
very high operational costs so I thought

1081
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:23,489
we might ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who are avoiding</font>

1082
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,109
the largest network in the world with

1083
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:34,739
traffic engineering what their comments

1084
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:37,890
are going yeah in and in the be specific

1085
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:39,509
its operational costs for<font color="#E5E5E5"> set in the</font>

1086
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:41,459
ninety percent for the ten percent there

1087
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:45,089
might not be a better way to do it right

1088
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:48,479
so I don't understand Blaine units for

1089
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:50,819
everybody I guess the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1090
00:57:48,479 --> 00:57:53,910
for you is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on not</font>

1091
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:55,650
implementing NLCS at OC 48 and no<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cyn to</font>

1092
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:57,769
speed what are you going to do with a

1093
00:57:55,650 --> 00:58:00,180
sparsely connected high-speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

1094
00:57:57,769 --> 00:58:03,319
what are you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> implement are you going</font>

1095
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:05,459
to just manage all your eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp metrics</font>

1096
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:07,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">off hand you can use something like</font>

1097
00:58:05,459 --> 00:58:10,288
wandl and try and be very deterministic

1098
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:12,209
how are you going to know when you have

1099
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:14,489
linked failures that your traffic is

1100
00:58:12,209 --> 00:58:15,989
going the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next best path especially if</font>

1101
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:20,789
it's a very large parts of connected

1103
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:25,259

00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:27,538
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected densely connected partial</font>

1105
00:58:25,259 --> 00:58:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">money then okay I densely connected</font>

1106
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:33,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">parcel much in one question I have for</font>

1107
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,420
the unit operations would be how much of

1108

<font color="#CCCCCC">your time is focused around problems</font>

1110
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:45,029
circuit failures hardware failures etc

1111
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:48,779
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a lot of time with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> temp</font>

1112
00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:50,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">you less problems we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

1113
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:52,920
that many I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean basically the problems</font>

1114
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:55,589
or many other problems it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1116
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:59,729
point where we want it yet we're working

1117
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:02,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">very hard on getting it to that point</font>

1118
00:58:59,729 --> 00:59:05,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Daniel's alluded to some of that and</font>

1119
00:59:02,609 --> 00:59:07,859
when it reaches that point it will be

1120
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:09,539
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much similar to the way that</font>

1121
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:11,308
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with or that we deal</font>

1122
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:13,769
with the current ATM network basically

1123

the current idiom graphic engine and

1124
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:19,258

getting the contracts then they pushed

it out so basically total<font color="#E5E5E5"> man tyne once</font>

now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know what is the percentage</font>

of networks that truly need it and y & x

1138
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:57,490

this transition theory that we really

need something to go to fix the
