for the database we evaluated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sun</font>

185
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,710
with real sharp we were pretty surprised

186
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,560
to find out that how much IBM is

187
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,229
invested so the bottom line<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we put</font>

with the Sun we switched over this

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,840
weekend and our Layton sees have dropped

about 260 270 milliseconds during peak

196
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,289
they drop to about 150 160 or so why

197
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,110
that's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zara Pisa is a</font>

about what happened with a route shortly

had just overcome the box and there were

a couple little issues we were getting

<font color="#CCCCCC">was a relatively small percentage but we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">walking's were pushed it over the edge</font>

going to get to the room so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

284
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,540
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened when would you</font>

285
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,400
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally the days of deployment</font>

286
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,430
the total number of resolutions for the

287
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">day doubled over what it was before</font>

288
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,849
another way of looking at is looking at

289
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:01,060
the drops if you look at this generally

290
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,640
the the load<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the a roof goes up</font>

291
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,229
around nine o'clock eight to twenty

292
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,870
eight and ten and it stays pretty level

293
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,250
there until<font color="#E5E5E5"> about six or so we can see</font>

294
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:16,270
where we deployed it was exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> eleven</font>

295
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:18,640
one last bit is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of making more</font>

296
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:22,060
of the operation of the registry both

297
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:25,480
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OTP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side and DNS accessible to folks</font>

298
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,969
were piloting them some near real-time

299
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,430
stats in other words a towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

300
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or very early q1 we're going</font>

301
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,290
to have

302
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,060
a site in a central where you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,170

305
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,280
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some average stats take a</font>

306
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,930
look at a real-time feed go back and

307
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,550
look at some historical what you see

308
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,550
fear which may be very hard to read is

309
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,109
on the left hand side by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this</font>

310
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,640
thing updates about once every five

311
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,890
seconds so we'll show you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,949
type of request those per second and

percentage coming in by request type it

314
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,100
will show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet counts UDP</font>

315

316
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,570
show you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TL bees that are getting</font>

318
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,100
popular the twenty ten twenty thirty

319
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,180
it's configurable most popular things

320
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,640
that are being queried and where they're

321
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,989
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how many duplicates as we've</font>

322
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">been watching this a lot more closely</font>

323
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,380
we're finding that there are a fair

324
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,420
number of misconfigured servers out

325
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,430
there there was one particular fellow

326
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,500
who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a server that had gotten</font>

caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an infinite loop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and was</font>

328
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,170
clearing the same domain name about 100

329
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,700
per second on the area no idea why we

330
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,880
called him up he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very apologetic and</font>

331
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,040
stopped but<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is amazing we</font>

332
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,839
got updates from him on a couple hour

333
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,640
basis for a week as to what he was doing

334
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,180
he got a little nervous<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the whole</font>

335
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,730
situation but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were following up on</font>

00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of employee ID estimation was</font>

337
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,040
in kind of fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low</font>

338
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,069
neighborhood is just spurious about

339
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,810
misconfigurations queries coming from

340
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,440
the exact same client for the exact same

341
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:59,060
name same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address you know hundreds</font>

342
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,950
of times a second so we're following up

343
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,459
on those but anyway in terms of openness

344
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,570
look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vienna central over the next</font>

345
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,670
probably about three or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months and</font>

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing some near real-time</font>

348
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,839
consolation any question

349
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:27,269
yes fall only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one minor comment 0</font>

350

Enix on our comm service don't have any

352
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:38,878
memory problems really so my name<font color="#E5E5E5"> D runs</font>

353
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:41,249
six months at a time to clean up grades

354
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:45,300
and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only reason it grows is</font>

355
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:47,970
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm gets bigger okay we're</font>

356
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,969
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> memory leak it may I will</font>

357
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,369
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to David with women were started</font>

359
00:14:53,369 --> 00:15:00,029
thank you the by the way the comment

360
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:02,160
about memory leaks is for the version of

361
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:04,259
mind we're running on sun which would be

362
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,839
8 12 with with all the patches that we

363
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,189
put in place in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some tweaks as well so</font>

364
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not a comment about the current</font>
