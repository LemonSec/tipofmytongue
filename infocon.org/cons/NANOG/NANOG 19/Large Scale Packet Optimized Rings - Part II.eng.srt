1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090
so now it's my pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:11,219
mark title from versatile good afternoon

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:16,710
everybody first of all thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I</font>

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:22,859
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hear me just little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:25,830
volume on the mic<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah is that</font>

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,720
better okay first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all dis or thanks</font>

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,038
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> patrick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coomer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the loan of his</font>

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,630
notebook because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i forgot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring my</font>

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,739
port replicator for my vaio which was

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,360
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do nano 16</font>

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,010
i think it was i presented part<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 of</font>

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,160
this presentation which was our

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,800
deployment plans for optimized packet

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,849
rings deploying cisco DPT<font color="#E5E5E5"> srt technology</font>

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,320
in that talk we covered what we would

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,520
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and how we would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,640
it we've come a long way since then

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've rolled out one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rings we're</font>

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,789
just about finished installing the the

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,340
core ring OC 48 chlorine so the talk

21
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,890
today is to continue on from that talk

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,600
and to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at somebody some of the</font>

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,939
issues associated with our deployment

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,890
and also to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,110
solutions so we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus a</font>

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,330
little bit on some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues we had</font>

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,070
mapping things like fiber topologies

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,740
into ring topologies how we did that

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,298
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at I GP issues and</font>

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,679
EGP issues as well how we actually

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,229
configured our routing it's actually

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,549
quite a complex exercise in the

33
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure that we have so part one of</font>

34
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,439
the first presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did at nanog 16</font>

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,450
the brief was basically to affect the

36
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,570
migration from traditional transmission

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,799
technologies to a next<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation</font>

38
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,869
platform optimized for the transmission

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,759
of purely packetized data<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm sure</font>

40
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,770
all of you out there understand why this

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do with even</font>

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">touched on some issues today with mpls</font>

43
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,420
and some of those discussions so this

44
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,009
was a design brief taking this brief

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:00,329
from my management we went away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

46
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,329
did the design all these rings why we're

47
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,309
asked to do it obviously it's a cool

48
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing to do but more importantly is the</font>

49
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,030
money associated with it so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> general</font>

50
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,290
business drive is not just for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as a</font>

51
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,780
company but for for all organizations

52
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,189
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to do this is to move</font>

53
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,319
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a structure where you can provide</font>

54
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:20,319
all your services based over an IP

55
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,790
infrastructure in many ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's reduced</font>

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,560
costs and can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> increase your</font>

57
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,439
revenue therefore obviously you become

58
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,209
more profitable it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> provides with a</font>

59
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:32,230
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> management platform you no longer</font>

60
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:33,579
need to manage your your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATMs as well as</font>

61
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,459
your IP routers you can use a single

62
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:37,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">management platform so that provides</font>

63
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,180
your ease of ongoing operations and

64
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,430
support and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> with certain regards as</font>

65
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,120
well lower maintenance costs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of</font>

66
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:52,810
ownership also business drivers is also

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:54,459
to leave the push into IP optics layer 2

68
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,340
and layer 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> signaling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and things like</font>

69
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,379
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also to have the opportunity to</font>

70
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,879
influence the early adopters<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

71
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:04,179
marketplace<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get in there early with</font>

72
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,540
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of technologies specifically</font>

73
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,790
for versatile as a company where a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fibre</font>

74
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,769
carrier and facilities based<font color="#E5E5E5"> fibre</font>

75
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,578
carrier in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Benelux region and now</font>

76
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,379
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> north with north west germany for</font>

77
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:23,049
us it was actually to better utilize our

78
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:25,810
fiber network also one of the challenges

79
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:28,030
from a management was to map the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber</font>

80
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,370
technology against a decent network

81
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,579
architecture which could be utilized as

82
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,079
a profitable product to decrease<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

83
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:38,139
cost per megabit per second on the

84
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,400
network too short<font color="#E5E5E5"> and provisioning lead</font>

85
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,310
time so we could provision more

86
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,290
customers faster and more accurately

87
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,389
also shorten the product time to market

88
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,220
with these facilities you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

89
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:51,159
provision circuits that need to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

90
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,569
your SDH guys or switch Ops guys can all

91
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,040
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VIP guys in one centralized team</font>

92
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,470
provide endless scalability on over here

93
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,750
endless a lot if we look towards new

94
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,159
technologies it's becoming not necessary

95
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,810
reality but becoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we need</font>

96
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,328
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider how do we provide endless</font>

97
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:11,109
availability for the backbone and for

98
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:13,780
customers to provide a DWDM plug and

99
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:16,478
play model what we developed today is

100
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,789
sort of a step<font color="#E5E5E5"> one towards a full DWDM</font>

101
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,620
solution in our network<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can pick up</font>

102
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the current network and plonk it on to</font>

103
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,280
lambda

104
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,650
for example and also to provide forward

105
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,229
consideration to mpls and multi-product

106
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,770
multi lambda switch multi-protocol amber

107
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:36,370
switching so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little graph</font>

108
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,200
here just<font color="#CCCCCC"> on off the top of my head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

109
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,000
figures possibly fictitious but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

110
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,349
in the realms of reality for what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,240
could actually expect and when we look

112
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:49,030
to these types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technologies in our</font>

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">network we the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand scale is</font>

114
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,929
basically a list of products where we

115
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,820
are today we're sort of into things like

116
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,620
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> carries over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> st eights and things</font>

117
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,890
like that really we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be heading</font>

118
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">towards providing ip-based circuits</font>

119
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,729
which is at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of the scale there</font>

120
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,070
and obviously that's at the top end of

121
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,780
the technology push as well as the

122
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,120
maximum revenue and profit area as well

123
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,169
so we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to climb we're</font>

124
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,160
really trying to climb this this

125
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:20,530
technology curve to maximize a return on

126
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the investment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as possible if</font>

127
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,109
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> has any questions I think we can</font>

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,970
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go along rather than</font>

129
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">bien because this actually jumps between</font>

130
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,690
some very different different areas so

131
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,560
if you have questions does Clark to am I

132
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:35,169
can take them as we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> along so our</font>

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,940
challenges as a fiber provider in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">Benelux area which is building</font>

distances in this area are quite small

147
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,940
200 kilometers that gives us I think in

148
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. we probably turned that more of</font>

149
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,260
a metropolitan type of network but

150
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,150
that's that's for a certain

151
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,620
international network so we had some

152
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,719
issues in how we actually match these

153
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,850
segments and how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually overlay</font>

154
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,120
the optical infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> over these</font>

155
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,190
type of distances so that was quite

156
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,800
challenging I cover that in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> depths</font>

157
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of some depth as well and associated</font>

158
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,960
with that is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we design optical</font>

159
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,880
regeneration once we had actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> met</font>

160
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> typologies how did we do the optical</font>

161
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,900
regeneration obviously we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

162
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,669
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdh in this network and later on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

163
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,758
the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I touch on how we</font>

164
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:46,130
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the the comparison made the</font>

165
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,509
decision not to implement any SDH in

166
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,530
this network there are SRP overhead

167
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:54,410
considerations as well we needed to look

168
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">at all so where do we actually choose to</font>

169
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">build our pots along this fiber do we do</font>

170
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:01,639
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> build it based according to where we</font>

171
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,020
need to put optical regions do we do it

172
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,240
based on where we can generate maximum

173
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,440
revenue from the products we sell so

174
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> range of questions we</font>

175
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,219
needed to address there as well and then

176
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,020
once we did this how do we actually fit

177
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,690
all the Rings together we actually going

178
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,099
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> building nine rings so how do we</font>

179
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,259
how do we actually join these rings

180
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:19,880
together and that's both an IP end and a

181
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">fiber sort of a layer one layer two</font>

182
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:30,560
layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 issue if you wanted to go that</font>

183
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:32,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">far so to SDH or not to SDA feel you</font>

184
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys call us on it here so this is more</font>

185
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,780
tailored for a European market but SDH

186
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,659
provides us the circuit capacity real

187
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">circuit capacity on our fiber network</font>

188
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:45,139
DPT or SRP technology does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow us</font>

189
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,460
to define customer base surface that

190
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:50,539
single pipes based on pure IP capacity

191
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,250
so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in mind how does this</font>

192
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,570
impact our business model this was

193
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,250
actually a major stumbling block in our

194
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,570
organization as we as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've looked into</font>

195
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:02,570
how we did this how we did this project

196
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,650
one of the issues is as you sell IT you

197
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,719
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it cheaper for</font>

198
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,159
the same amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of capacity so your</font>

199
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,370
revenues actually do decrease when you

200
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:14,650
sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> these products compared to a sonic</font>

201
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:17,449
solution generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP is is cheaper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

202
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,409
it is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheaper to implement DPT so</font>

203
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,909
there's a trade-off there between

204
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:21,500
revenues and the cost of implementation

205
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:25,159
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that becomes a strategic decision</font>

206
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,219
within your organization so based on

207
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,770
these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> facts then the key factor for</font>

208
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:33,679
so net financial success is that we need

209
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do higher volume sales which</font>

210
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,929
obviously the matter there is quite

211
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,149
simple to figure that one out so to be

212
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:42,010
more profitable we need to sell more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

213
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:44,029
these IP based products higher volumes

214
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,620
thing with sth in this type of

215
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:48,210
architecture is that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have a</font>

216
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,060
incremental<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost as you build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

217
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,140
network because you must implement first

218
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,540
of all the fiber and then you must

219
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,939
terminate it on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM and then you must</font>

220
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the router which still has your DPT</font>

221
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,570
line card in it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example so you</font>

222
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,640
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to add the router</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sdh or</font>

223
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,790
sonic will yield a broader<font color="#E5E5E5"> range of more</font>

224
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,400
profitable products and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dbt is obviously</font>

225
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,689
it's optimized purely for IP so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

226
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,010
these are the considerations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

227
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,600
to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about as we were deploying the</font>

228
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,920
network and we traded them off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

229
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided that we're going to go the DPT</font>

230
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:25,140
route we also thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we may have</font>

231
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,450
to utilize sonnet or sth in some

232
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:31,410
segments in our rings due to the optical

233
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">path length and also the fiber</font>

234
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,540
requirements to close the Rings for

235
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,950
those of you who've done ring

236
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,930
architecture design before it's very

237
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,610
possible for a small ring to have to

238
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,430
traverse large amounts of fiber to close

239
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,400
it over the redundant paths so we had

240
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,810
some fiber costs metrics associated with

241
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,339
our decisions as well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the</font>

242
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,959
architecture of the network any

243
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:57,860
questions so far it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

244
00:09:51,959 --> 00:10:00,420
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a quantum jump okay so we had</font>

245
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,880
basically six<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems when we had to</font>

246
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the topology of this network we</font>

247
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,510
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine fiber rings covering</font>

248
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,180
35 pots and three countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

249
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,170
actually now expanded to four

250
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,849
geographical distances and optical

251
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,310
limitations were a huge problem for us

252
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,839
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution and the</font>

253
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,219
line card issues we sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cisco</font>

254
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,200
DPT line cards so the solution that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

255
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,580
came up with was to create an

256
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,779
international<font color="#E5E5E5"> call ring at OC 48 speeds</font>

257
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,730
there was some simplification of fiber

258
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,660
paths in this design which you see in

259
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,550
the moment but there was actually a

260
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,569
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that so we</font>

261
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,839
decided we build an international

262
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:39,240
chlorine and we would actually overlay

263
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,750
on to that local distribution rings<font color="#E5E5E5"> per</font>

264
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,130
country or per region as we define them

265
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,959
and we have to utilize optical

266
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,970
regeneration so we chose not to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go with</font>

267
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sonnet solution and atms on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

268
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,839
longer paths we decided to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

269
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,220
optical regeneration of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

270
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,089
only sensible with you own the fiber in

271
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,280
the ground you're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

272
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,110
tell cohered<font color="#CCCCCC"> savannah to do that over</font>

273
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,000
large distances but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us being a major</font>

274
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,680
carry this was quite a sensible solution

275
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,990
the scalability and growth because we

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,849
can just pop those out wrap the ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

277
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,220
install<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new optical regen at the</font>

278
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,800
higher speeds so this was a sensible

279
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,860
solution for us so without going into

280
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,569
too much detail about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this map basically</font>

281
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:21,690
we build a sick spot chlorine OC 48

282
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,580
speeds with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one through seven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

283
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,940
eight distribution rings that hang off

357

359
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:25,380
coming out for example i believe the

360
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:28,590
6500 switches are looking at building in

361
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,970
some DPT cards for those so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

362
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,950
what are the design parameters for those

363
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,230
where can we use and can we drop them

364
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,610
directly in an office on one of these

365
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,290
distribution rings for example and

366
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,030
supply voice and data or the same switch

367
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,160
so there are lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we have to</font>

368
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we're designing that so</font>

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,130
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did achieve matching the</font>

371
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:51,689

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and seriously consider on some parts</font>

didn't use it due to capacity

379
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:14,550
than our traditional ADM sonet/sdh

what the sonnet rings were being scaled

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:21,459
to so we decided not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it on a lot</font>

383
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,269
of it all the segments and it's also

384
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:26,618
it's also not as plugin playable as a

obviously going to require at least two

400

401

physical fiber bars and the ability to

402

said well what's the overhead as we grow

overhead what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SRT overhead how</font>

does all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> work are we going to see</font>

about 1.5 k a second for<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS obviously</font>

437
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,520
on 3048 ringing who cares it's

438
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:29,200
absolutely negligible but when I when I

439
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,600
look at the other protocols used on the

440
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,690
ring we have IPS topology discovery and

441
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,959
usage control for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten ten knows we talk</font>

442
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,549
that to be roughly at OC 48 speeds 2

443
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,169
megabits a second so again relatively

444
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:43,600
negligible and this little calculation

445
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:46,149
here at OC 12 the ring overhead is less

446
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,269
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1% so who are we saw no issue there</font>

as you might go up to 32 notice the ring

450
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:57,759
and this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is internode traffic</font>

00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,860
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not across the whole ring so</font>

452
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,850
it's very small I should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> known in</font>

455
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,019
been more useful but nevertheless it's

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:10,360
very small before I touch population

457
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:11,830
there is one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot to add as we</font>

461
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,919
i'll tell you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we built the ring</font>

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,479
everything's running properly the is is

472

worked there was no issue at all except

00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:51,340
the topology was broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> the databases</font>

474
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,990
were broken and we had some concerns and

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,428
as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look toward mpls and things like</font>

that that make<font color="#E5E5E5"> her has caused us</font>

478
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,070
actually now bug being fixed buses go

479
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,990
for that one at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment ok pop</font>

480
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,710
selection on this architecture how do we

481
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:11,440
actually choose our points of<font color="#E5E5E5"> presence</font>

482
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:15,519
we baste them on two criteria return on

483
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,899
investment where do we build the pots to

484
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,399
get the most return on investment

485
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:19,809
obviously is quite an expensive exercise

486
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,330
to be laying this out<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said before</font>

487
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:24,850
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 fibers around the ring basically</font>

sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 pairs of fiber around the ring</font>

489
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,340
and multi millions and equipment so how

490
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:31,570
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually maximize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it well you want</font>

491
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get your pops as close to say</font>

492
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,689
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> parks exchange points and</font>

493
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,250
things like that where you actually sell

494
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,049
your services into these facilities and

495
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,919
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do that that</font>

496
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:43,840
impacts your path selection in terms of

497
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,759
mapping the actual logical network under

498
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,769
the topology because it may actually

499
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,250
pull you out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to get close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

500
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,250
these places

501
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:55,428
so we actually we let the commercial

502
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,889
guys tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us where to put the pots</font>

503
00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:00,049
strangely enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they're the</font>

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys that give us money optical</font>

505
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,379

506
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,700
and again like I said proximity to an

507
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting sites such as exchange</font>

points possible major customers

509
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:14,750
developing business parks etc ok now the

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">international core ring it's an OC 48</font>

516
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:36,289
just borderline so again we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,809
on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

that whatever we do upgrade that the

520
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,360

methodology that allows for the overlay

532
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,980
of complex routing architecture so we

533
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,630
can get optimal routing between the

<font color="#CCCCCC">from this diagram the the core pots will</font>

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:36,610
show that clearly on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram but</font>

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,710
these are different points of presence

543
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:43,760
so that twelve six teams will bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

suddenly will bring in the OC 12

546
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:52,039
distribution rings and they will both

547
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:54,020
come together on the 12 16 s so the

548
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason for actually bringing these in</font>

549
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,590

550
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,880
the ring will still operate we didn't

551
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,199
want to close in the one pop so we

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually close rings through to pops</font>

553

I'll jump back the architecture to to

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,179
highlight that quite an important design

555
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:10,710

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:30,299
that was if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do lose the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Brussels pot</font>

programs on in their future visions what

00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:56,908
are we aiming to do in the future why

did we do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:06,240
provide intelligent I p lambda capacity

basically one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future provide</font>

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,320
me the ability for our customers to

request optical capacity through the IP

754
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,850
layer so should they buy a chunk of

755
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,250
capacity from a scene they may choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

756
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,649
switch in more capacity through the IP

757
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,090
layer talking to the optical layer and

758
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:23,279
also should be run out of optical

759
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:28,590
capacity on any<font color="#CCCCCC"> path to re-route that</font>

to an intelligent DWDM solution one of

762
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,219
the possibilities there is to provide

763

764
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,820
hanging off our distribution rings the

customers who want to have multiple

provide intelligent optical switching<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

768
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,159
guess is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> key feature we're</font>

769
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:51,719
looking for optical path selection and

00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have to take those I guess I</font>

773
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:02,170
bored you all to death

774

okay thank you
