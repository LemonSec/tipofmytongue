00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:08,009
now my pleasure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lewis</font>

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:18,090
talking about security and good morning

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:20,640
to everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> too okay let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">dnf security or DNS security extensions</font>

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,130
is something that's been going on for

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:28,160
about four or five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of engineering</font>

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,240
right now and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> still out with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">Venus in general there are a lot of</font>

changes coming to DNS right now dnf<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC</font>

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,039
is one one major change to it dynamic

update being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change zones on the</font>

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,389
on the fly is coming along with securing

13
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,638
that and I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that part also</font>

14
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:46,499
ipv6 is causing some changes to the name

15
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:49,829
servers with the a6 record and the

16
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:53,459
binary labels for verse verse mapping

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,559
and also some other improvements was

ingredients first one is the dns

00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,839
security extensions which are the key

24
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,969
and sig records the NXT records and

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,789
they're generally involved with securing

26

name servers a name server communication

27
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:22,469
the next part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net security</font>

28
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,369
suite is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i call query response</font>

40
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,219
for people to retrieve and finally a

have make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the updates are correct</font>

45
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:12,510
features that these four<font color="#E5E5E5"> ingredients are</font>

46
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:13,739
offering one is the protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

query a zone somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

50
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,780
internet we have to use one type of

security to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font>

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,120
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> from server you control to</font>

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,200
another server you control and in that

case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something a little</font>

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,030
bit more efficient than what we do for

61
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,880
mobile security a public key

62
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,560
infrastructure is a feature where we're

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,140
giving out fees for example and

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,990
certificates and also we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> never nad</font>

security dynamic updates right now the

66

DNS SEC is defined in a few RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 35 in</font>

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,650
the area at RFC series is the primary

68
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,080
definition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dnf sec there are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

other RFC's that are associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,470
that it's at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

71
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,110
presentation there's a two-page

72
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,940
bibliography which lists other RFC's to

73
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,270
see I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually didn't list every</font>

74
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,329
one of them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put the range down</font>

75
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:24,240
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary implementation of DNS</font>

76
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,720
SEC is of course our<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns is bind is use</font>

77
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,010
bind right now we're working on the

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,250
version 9 dnf sec first appeared in vine

79
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,459
in version 8.2 last March and right now

80
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,690
we're up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 2 2 p-5 I think a 23 is</font>

81
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,070
due sometime and I don't know when

82
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,630
what's in there is the ability to at

83
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,090
least play with DNS SEC it's a good

84
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,920
place to learn gain a stack I don't know

85
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,660
if we recommend anyone operationally

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,269
using DNS second those servers yet

87
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,740
because we really weren't ready in 8 22

88
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:01,200
a DNS SEC beta 9 version 9 is a brand

89
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,670
new bill from scratch in which DNS SEC

90
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,560
will be fully implemented right now beta

91
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,059
3 has been out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course being a</font>

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,860
beta they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully functional yet</font>

93
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,480
you can get idea of what the real beta

94
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,300
is the real by nine is going to look

95
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,358
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but beta 4 is do real soon now</font>

96
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,310
I saw that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a code freeze on now</font>

97
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,880
so i'll probably by the end of this week

98
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,880
if not today

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,700
the protocol right now is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's</font>

100
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:33,210
in they<font color="#E5E5E5"> work done in to be enough to</font>

101
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,070
idea working groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> dnf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> EXT is looking</font>

102
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,950
at some refinements of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol as</font>

103
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,230
part of its charter right now it's a

104
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:44,070
proposed standard which is the first of

105
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,510
the level of standards for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF it</font>

106
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,159
still needs some work to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> full</font>

107
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's missing is</font>

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,610
operational experience and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

109
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,460
I've been trying to promote the last

110
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,420
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year or sell DNS off is another</font>

111
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,580
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

112
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,260
operational issues with DNS now that's

113
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,919
both of these groups are fairly new

114
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,530
about maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> year old each another DNS</font>

115
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,120
off I've done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of workshops to</font>

116
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,890
try to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the protocol and the</font>

117
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,530
workshops<font color="#E5E5E5"> are mostly for my benefit in</font>

118
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols benefit because we have to</font>

119
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,229
iron out some what<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficulties some of</font>

120
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,140
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not sure right now</font>

121
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,910
the protocol in terms of just training

122
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,969
people using DNS SEC we're not there yet

123
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,390
as the tools aren't completely finished

124
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:27,390
and the questions we have now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

125
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,950
operate this stuff and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> how what</font>

126
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,479
policies are going to be used how you're

127
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,010
going to trust the data out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of DNS like</font>

128
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,169
those things really haven't settled out

129
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,880
there are a lot of ideas on how to do

130
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:40,940
that but no consensus is that has been

131
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:44,490
built in terms of deployment of DNS SEC

132
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,830
again so kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an ipv6 Europe is</font>

133
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:58,950
very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in this I've done</font>

134
00:05:46,830 --> 00:06:01,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">in workshops over there what is and so</font>

135
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,729
joking<font color="#CCCCCC"> here somewhere</font>

136
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:11,880
a one cut work hello one country<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

137
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,100
planning on having<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS SEC up and</font>

138
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,200
running by January first two thousand

139
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:20,670
one and two others will be following

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:25,409
within a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of that in CNT r</font>

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:28,110
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> c entr which is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> european and</font>

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly not to describe it co-op</font>

171
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,900
here we have a resolver that's declined

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> DN asus what does all the lookups and</font>

00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,509
we'll talk about that a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

prefer to a further forward observers

196
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,289
and then I have other servers here

197
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:35,060
because the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing some of the</font>

198
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,848
lookup you may go to lots of other

199
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,159
servers a resolver usually goes to

200
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:42,680
recursive server by default it can

201
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,579
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to any server it wants to if</font>

he just knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the server is DNS</font>

203
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:52,010

they could each exist individually DNS

206
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,839
SEC is formalizing the idea that they

207
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,990
all travel together for example in this

211
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,439
versus servers and is a important

212
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,880
concept of DNS SEC zones are

213
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,100
administrative cuts of the namespace

214
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,860
their domain name space is built up the

doesn't that one two one two domains a

219
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,699

220
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,439
serving information so the zone is the

queries and catches information so when

they go on through the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

cryptography I'll keep to one slide

237
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,589
what's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is their</font>

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,470
efficient way to do encryption and

hashing of information public keys are

247
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,840
another form of cryptography in which I

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,970
keep a private key<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I give you the</font>

252
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,160
distributing the public key is easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

we have a license to use the RSA

covering the SOA records we have a we

00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,990
may have a decrement of TTL it's been

354
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,240
ticking down a bit I have to reset the

at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this here so I asked to</font>

359
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,030
when I do when verification take a

signature out or take the TTL out

361
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:35,290
replace it verify it but then go back to

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:36,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other TTL one of the more something</font>

364
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,079
consideration here is faith there is an

365
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:44,950
expiration time for this signature up to

369
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,000
permit from the primary but now we have

370
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,819
data which will actually go bad in the

371
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,380
primary so sober someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up a</font>

372
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,700

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and change on this adventure</font>

374
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,550
off times up there when I secure the

375
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,760
data so we have two periods of time of

376
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,229
an expiration time in the start time

377
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,480
having a start time allows me to put

378
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,430
signatures into the future for<font color="#CCCCCC"> purposes</font>

379
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,130
of rolling over keys I may want to use

one<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of keys for today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or this week</font>

381
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,650
and no set of keys for next week and I

382
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,380
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the signatures out there</font>

383
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:26,709
when when they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used the</font>

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,960
next two fields here this one number

00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,910
here as an example so you can see

387
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:39,459
separation so well identify the signer

388
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:42,339
of the key this 39<font color="#CCCCCC"> 170 199 etc is the</font>

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,290
we've done now now have two versions of

I've highlighted a cig record my mouse

one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in this case here i have</font>

three NS records for my zone at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3</font>

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,500
have one NS record to cover all three of

479
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,450
them because those NS records are going

480
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,590
to be held together as a set of data so

481
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,049
when they travel around they'll travel

482
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,250
together and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a and the signature</font>

486
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,929
so these three records here are being

487
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:54,220
signed by this one record also here i

488

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:10,450
over these three records also in here i

have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NXT record which i've</font>

xt record here says after active<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

501
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:31,659
comes following that and present at this

502
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:34,000

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,850
active in this zone is also known as

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,210
active in another zone that i have and i

505
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,439
have say again Eckstein and they're also

506
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,030
another another example to change the

507
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,620
dns fee names now can actually have

508
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:50,830
certain other types in there but just

509
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:53,439
DNS SEC types this is this is a

510
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,030
schematic of how a query might happen

511
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,130
queries can have number different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one possible way for it to</font>

recursive name server caching

519
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,470
information for me the first thing this

520
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,090
name sir will do assuming it knows

521
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,190
nothing about the answers that walked a

522
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:20,530
root server and say where do I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

523
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,270
information and the root server I'm

524
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,639
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume here which happened some</font>

525
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:27,039
of the operations has the root zone plus

526
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,289
also the the ccTLDs or the top level

527
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,559
domains and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll send back here</font>

528
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer saying that to get hosted example</font>

530
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,580
and so my resolver which is part of the

531
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,610
kurjan goes off to this other name

532
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,139
server and gets the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want which is</font>

533
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,350
the way things used to work and be done

534
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:51,070
with it but I also get a signature of

535
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:53,918
that record of that set of data funded

536
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">by example and XY itself and so I'll get</font>

537
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,720
an additional data the key record and

538
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:02,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature of that key x is the next</font>

539
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,850

542
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">routes keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing else so what happens</font>

543
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,750
now is I have to go off in this name

544
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:16,270
server here ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X Y to</font>

545
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,700
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to verify that signature when I</font>

546
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,230
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that back I get the key and also get</font>

547
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the signature of that key by the roots</font>

548
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:26,140
key at this point here the name server

549
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,030
will go off and go through the data

550
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,590
saying this data is signed by the or it

551
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,840
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> go either way top-down or</font>

552
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,520
bottom-up tenderly implementation when I

553
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,709
have the data I look at the signature of

554
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,070
the key say okay assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he is</font>

555
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the data is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

556
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,389
I go up one level say well just kyokai<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

557
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,159
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be the previous signature</font>

558
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:44,870
and key and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I get back to the root</font>

559
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,679
key which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I've trusted because I</font>

560
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,090
have configured that and finally when

561
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,470
this was all<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens when this happens</font>

562
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,090
the local name server will have verify

563
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,899
the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends the data back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

pass that around and people start

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,179
trusting it after I have that setup I

585
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,820
can do the signing of the zone i

586
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,730
generate the signature records and

587
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:59,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">finally the NXT and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see NXT are all also</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">much cover this already that the query</font>

we put something that secret in the

we don't have to store that anywhere but

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:42,049
in memory we can work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as far</font>

as T<font color="#CCCCCC"> cig early on we see that mostly in</font>

things like

658
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,860
in trances that's the easiest place to

659
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:49,070
use that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been using an already and</font>

also special clients dhcp updating is

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:53,210
seen as an early place to put this and

662
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:57,889
we see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the growth in this will come</font>

later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to give you an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what e-cig</font>

664
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,720
looks like a configuration file<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font>

665
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:04,730
primary server and secondary server and

666
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,019
I just put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret in in both places</font>

667
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:10,419
and the secret I've used here is a

668
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:12,440
ballot secret it's encoded in a 64

communities capitalized lowercase

670
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,279
letters you can't use any phrase there's

a restriction on what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of phrases</font>

672
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,130
can be in there that one this one works

673
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,309
it's the right number of letters as the

674
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,600
right ending letters and so on and the

675
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,789
algorithm that's in there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going with</font>

Hellman exchange which if you're

731

and then there are two other definitions

742
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,560
the client says the server I wanted to

one size deriving the secret by itself

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,110
the secret has to travel over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wire</font>

749
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,450
in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to be encrypted and</font>

750
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,100
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into encrypting information we</font>

that stuff has never been implemented

756
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,870
caution with it with a tiki situation

757
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,460
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tiki can request the server</font>

758
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,899
to go off and do lots of processing

759
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,880
you're doing get the helmet exchanges

760
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,240
for example the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to golf and</font>

761
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,430
think do some arithmetic if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tiki</font>

762
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,350
comes in with not find it you could end

763
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:10,480
up posing mile service threat to the

764
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,219
server so we make sure so we want to

765
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:17,590
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you're signing the Tiki</font>

00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,790
are the two pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data would fit in</font>

773
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,320
there over time I think certificates

774
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,139
have become a lot more important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

775
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,840
than the public key in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS because</font>

776
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,360
of the limits of what data set does in

777
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,159
the way of validation DNS we can say

778
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,250
here is what was given to me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you it's kind of just things what was</font>

or the key footprint and the key

this part this is still in definition

<font color="#CCCCCC">now we're just in the implementation</font>

822
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:40,150
this is one of the later parts of coming

823
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,950
with a bound version 9 there is a

proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> or an idea out there called</font>

00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:52,510
progressed to RFC but still being

829
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,339
implemented into the name server the

830
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,400
approach here would be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use teasing or</font>

831
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:00,340
60 messages to cover the updates and the

832
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,350
theory here is that the resolver is

833
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,480
talking to the name server as opposed to

834
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone it tells the name server here's</font>

835
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,380
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do to the zone that</font>

836
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,319
you're holding so the name server will

837
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,030
talk to to a resolver back and forth to

838
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,730
make sure that the request is correct

839
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:18,250
and from an authorized updater once that

840
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,230
data gets into the name server the name

841
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,940
sir will then hand to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone the zone</font>

842
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:25,980
will then have to find the data again

843
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,980
with the zone key and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that online</font>

844
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I guess one of the clinician</font>

845
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,940
mention here is a one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the big issue</font>

846
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is the great granularity of this</font>

847
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,910
policy because not everybody's gonna be

848
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,490
allowed to update everything in the zone

849
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:40,259
I don't want to let a general user throw

850
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,060
an NS record under their name I don't

851
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,580
want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> them delegate a new zone</font>

852
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,980
for themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're looking at what</font>

853
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,020
we allow general usually do and what we

854
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,369
allow other special entities to do an

855
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:55,560
administrator might be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add an</font>

00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:56,970
industry curd on the fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

857
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,470
few slides here to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact</font>

859
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:06,089
DNS SEC will increase the attention

860
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,700
that's being paid to DNS for reasons

861
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:11,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that year one is that data is actually</font>

862
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,960
going to expire from the name server the

863
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,720
signatures will go away when things just

864
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,190
go away the data will no longer be

865
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,509
handed out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being secure and so it</font>

866
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,250
won't be trusted so look like your zone

867
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,140
may disappear if you don't keep data

868
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:24,119
up-to-date so you have to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

869
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,770
you know when it is you sign your data

870
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,990
last how long you signed it until the

871
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">next time have to go through it and in</font>

872
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,740
particular if you don't if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find</font>

873
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:34,140
parts of the data at certain times some

874
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,839
of them might go bad but if you don't

875
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,190
keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that delegations are going</font>

876
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:40,200
to have a recurring relationship and

877
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the highest issue right now in</font>

879
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:45,569
relationship is going to be in the

880
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,970
sperians are going to have to manage

881
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,560
keys now we have new cryptographic

882
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,180
information I administrate as a whole

883
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,849
and there are new issues that will come

884
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,470
in on this for example where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put the</font>

00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:57,030
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys who has the private keys</font>

886
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,000
like the root passwords but a little bit

887
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,770
more in volume I guess and finally

888
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,119
there's a need for more resources to run

889
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:07,680
dnf security now as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font>

890
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,430
delegations the important part of

891
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,899
delegations for DNS SEC is that when i

892
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">delegate its own to someone else and let</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data they're going to generate their</font>

896
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:24,060
I'm going to have the child zones public

897
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,500
he's continually be signed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parent</font>

898
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,910
because the parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to sign</font>

899
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,390
the key forever and assign the key for

900
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:32,819
maybe a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> a month a week or so on</font>

901
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:34,950
when the parents signature goes bad the

902
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,200
child has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a new signature and how</font>

903
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,910
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we're</font>

904
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,410
envisioning that the child will

905
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,980
westbay signature from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parent put</font>

906
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,240
the onus on the child and remain secure

907
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,160
also the parent has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to say</font>

908
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,259
something to resolve is about the child

909
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,420
security status that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sticky</font>

910
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,789
issue right now how do we have a parent

911
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,500
say this child secure this child is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

912
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:57,329
secure and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the line so that</font>

913
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,650
we can do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve our queries</font>

914
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:03,030
correctly we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on trying to</font>

915
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,980
automate some of this and some of this

916
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,270
work we've been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pointing out</font>

917
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,280
to me and discussion yesterday was<font color="#E5E5E5"> vet</font>

918
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,589
we've been looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top</font>

919
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,240
level domains as opposed to the mid

920
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:14,009
range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bottom parts of the tree where</font>

921
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,859
there's more delegations when there is

922
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,140
data suppose this questions where the

923
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,069
delegations are more informal so we

924
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,069
spent a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time trying to automate</font>

925
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:25,140
this for a very widely delegated zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

926
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:26,130
look at some other issues of this and

927
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,359
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something where we workshops</font>

928
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,750
would help us identify what are the

929
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:34,348
other requirements and I have kind of a

930
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,849
naive question here will this need to

931
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:37,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">have returned Malaysia between the</font>

932
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:40,140
delegations keep the registry info

933
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,650
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> and went by registry here is I</font>

934
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,210
think of DNS not the Whois database and

935
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,010
I'm not so sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is actually</font>

936
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to solve a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem on basically</font>

937
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,010
just raising the question anyway but

938
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:51,450
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot of situations nowadays</font>

939
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,150
where domain name is getting hijacked

940
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:56,819
through other methods where the inter

941
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:01,440
registry protocol is<font color="#E5E5E5"> causing problems</font>

942
00:38:56,819 --> 00:39:04,079
not the dnf security so one of the

943
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,970
things referred to<font color="#CCCCCC"> in dnf security is</font>

944
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,490
something called offline signing and

945
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:11,189
this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation now where I don't</font>

946
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,509
just process my zone on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

947
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:14,700
right now your zone data could be on a

948
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:17,520
database it's publicly accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

949
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,470
just send that data or accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

950
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,059
it's on the network planters and you

951
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,669
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> restrictive use of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that net of that</font>

952
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,809
database but you can generate master

953
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,329
files in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just load them up</font>

954
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:28,589
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> away when you have a keys you</font>

955
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:30,299
don't want you want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys as</font>

956
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:32,220
far from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network as possible so you</font>

957
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:34,049
may have to have it it's are able to

958
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,759
have an air gap or something or a

959
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:37,440
firewall between where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do signing</font>

960
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,180
and where you publish the data so that

961
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,220
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone does go in and hack your name</font>

962
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,919
server and breaking the name server they

963
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,180
can't get the key information so that

964
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can sign your zone with some other</font>

965
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,169
data and one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably not</font>

966
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,809
the point out too well here is that if

967
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone breaks your zone they break into</font>

968
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:54,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">all zones below</font>

969
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,030
you so if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> feels comms key</font>

970
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,520
they've got all this data throughout the

971
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS or throughout the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calm worldliness</font>

972
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,430
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these concerns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

973
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,750
performance is that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

974
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,149
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more resources</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this because</font>

975
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,190
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing more work one is the</font>

976
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,050
increase in the amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data held when</font>

977
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,390
I have an a record i have a few bytes of

978
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,500
data if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sign that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

979
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,150
with a fitting to leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> a signature</font>

980
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,310
which is much bigger than the a record

981
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,109
so every race you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have won a record per</font>

982
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,640
set you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a cig record which</font>

983
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:27,839
is much bigger than that a record and so

984
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,940
on through the zone tcp right now may be

985
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,799
used more if ed and s0 isn't in place

986
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,410
and working which it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there</font>

987
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,790
because I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need bigger query</font>

988
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,529
I'm gonna have bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> responses coming</font>

989
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:40,470
back and right now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get truncated</font>

991
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:45,390
causes a big overhead on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your server and</font>

992
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,820
CPU cycles are going to be used in doing

993
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:51,089
the cryptography cryptograph the

994
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,310
cryptographic operations now in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

996
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,339
need more queries because now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

997
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,619
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the data I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need all</font>

998
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:02,940
the keys like we'll need to verify that

999
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,589
data going all the way up there so what

1000
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,380
I have here are two slides hearing about

1001
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:10,740
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this already these two slides</font>

1002
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,300
or the bibliography and all the URLs you

1003
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,740
have checked as recently as the end of

1004
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:20,300
May first one or the RFC's that are used

1005
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:23,490
to define DNS SEC and then there are two

1006
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:26,220
up in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stickers just went to RFC</font>

1007
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:30,089
in the last couple of weeks and here are

1008
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the two working group pages which</font>

1009
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:33,930
describe the work is going on currently

1010
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,810
IETF and these are these are current

1011

actually in group last call me an ITF

1016
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,000
these are other documents are not

1019
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:00,330
which has which describes this in

1020
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:03,089
English as opposed to drafts and rfcs

1021
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:04,500
it's still current in description but

1022
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:05,700
some of the links at had some of the

1023
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,940
references it has are out of

1024
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then here are some some pages these</font>

1025
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,340
two er workshops that were done last

1026
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,870
year which have early versions of these

1027
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,240
present this presentation and others

1028

1034
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:35,010
some page we found in danish first dates

1035
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,380
in danish the links off a better in

1036
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,320
English talking about DNS security and

1037
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,860
that was I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 1998 and down</font>

1038
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,530
your out of URLs for buying there's

00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me because we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open up</font>

1043

for questions no questions we're done

1044
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,890
with the NF<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font>

1045
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,730
didn't have a question but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1046
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:26,290
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question that came up in the</font>

1047
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:29,890
presentation a 23 is late reasonable too

1048
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:33,550
late is not just that I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slacker but</font>

1049
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:37,089
rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom we wanted it to be the</font>

1050
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:39,610
last version of x + 8 and so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1051
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:42,280
we think that there is some minor thing

1052
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,930
that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be checked into we sort of</font>

1053
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,510
delay another few weeks while we check

1054
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:51,490
into it this turns out i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1055
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:55,930
been the wrong strategy so a 2<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 beta 5</font>

1056
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:57,370
is in every way better than 82 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1057
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,830
think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put a cap on it</font>

1058
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:03,100
soon and announce today 23 will not be

1059
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:05,020
the last 58 so that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more or less</font>

1060
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,960
have room to add more in the future

1061
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:11,350
without the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lane of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> released it's in</font>

1062
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,600
progress and as for<font color="#CCCCCC"> by nine there is</font>

1063
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:18,430
another beta coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think today</font>

1064
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:20,110
the beta<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 and we are running it in</font>

1065
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:23,859
production on a number of internal

1066
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:26,500
systems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISC so one of the things</font>

1067
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:29,170
we've noticed is that it takes a smaller

1068
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:31,510
memory footprint to to represent huge

1069
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:34,030
zones another is that the

1070
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:37,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiprocessing actually works so if you</font>

1071
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:39,580
have a thread-safe machine and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1072
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiprocessing with you no good Colonel</font>

1073
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,470
supported threats and whatnot such as

1074
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,830
any of the mainstream units is like

1075
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:50,589
solaris or digital unix or whatever it

1076
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:53,799
will use all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpus and the balance is</font>

1077
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:56,890
nicely into because it scales nicely so

1078
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,870
I'm not saying to run right<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and move</font>

1079
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,080
all your nameservers to it but I am

1080
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:05,109
saying it's time to grab the beta and

1081
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,670
get some experience with it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1082
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:09,540
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's it will be in full public</font>

1083
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,540
release soon
