little bit about RFC 1918 use in the

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,910
internet and then touch briefly upon

10
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,620
ipv6 some one of these groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

the internet today and I'll leave you to

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:48,809
judge the impact of that who doesn't

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,719
know what r SE 1918 space is anybody not

15

know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's those</font>

16

ranges of addresses they are delegated

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,820
for use in private networks so what

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,049
they're supposed to do this is from the

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,810
RFC they are to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be unique</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> within an</font>

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,560
enterprise or a set of enterprises which

not supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appear in the big I</font>

23
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:21,509

that cannot have IP connectivity to any

of the enterprise these are numbers that

should not be visible you shouldn't see

28

them on the internet they shouldn't

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,369
appear in the routing tables the RFC is

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,170
not clear on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of issues one of</font>

31
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,780
them is should they appear in email

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,200
headers and should they appear in DNS

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:47,100
queries<font color="#CCCCCC"> application level use of this</font>

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,770
stuff the general idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my mind is</font>

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,320
that no they shouldn't that they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

36
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,360
my rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that raised my concerns with the</font>

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,909
agreed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be prudent to have</font>

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,759
a a backstop if you will there were some

40
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,770
concerns about automated registry

41
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,630
functions and an enterprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP</font>

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,040
turning in a

46
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,420
ourselves and so those these prefixes

are actually delegated to real name

about that in the next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides</font>

56
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:50,670
is that leaks and firewalls show up in

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS logs on these servers and</font>

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:57,609
attempting to get name resolution the

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:03,310
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years there the logs</font>

60
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,360
were pretty empty but there were some

61
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,270
quick people that said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

62
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,330
really should provide a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer so</font>

63
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,680
we tried to do that when one morning

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,830
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got what I thought were the</font>

appropriate permissions we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wild carted</font>

some all responses all PTR insert

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,239
answers for these prefixes to say read

68
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,280
RFC 1918 in a slum and want more polite

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,830
fashion thinking that this shouldn't be

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,680
a real problem well it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out that a</font>

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:36,190
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of three or four of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the big</font>

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,920
space to communicate between their

74

a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of large corporations and large</font>

that said read RFC 1918

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,940
I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting calls from the</font>

81
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,510
out in a couple of hours so we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

82
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,849
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation where these name servers</font>

83

still are authoritative but they do not

86
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:14,870
away this stuff shows up in logs not

<font color="#E5E5E5">only in our logs our DNS log but it</font>

89
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,349
and half a dozen other things as looks

90
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,910
like penetration attempts because the

91
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,550
name servers are attempting to respond

92
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,500
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we now spend a lot of</font>

94
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:38,660
we're not attacking your systems go away

95
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:40,520
read the RFC so what's there we're

96
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:45,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting between a million</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and two</font>

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:54,010
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a significant amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of RS e</font>

even though this instead of things are

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,449
misconfigured and it's probably useful

103
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,680
to encourage people to set up their

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:27,240
this by prefix and by by far the most

at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ipv6 delegation history</font>

150
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:02,280
ipv6 prefixes simply by doing some

151
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,419
simple math to encode your a s and then

152

attach it under this F dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> five ip6 int</font>

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,630
can tell but it hasn't been formally

interested in getting ipv6 visibility a

162
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,549

there's a transition delegation which is
