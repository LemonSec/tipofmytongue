00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,350
so i'm here to present some work that

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,849
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been taken by a research and</font>

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">start off with the assertion that the</font>

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,190
probably know what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I say / not affect this is when</font>

14
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,968
your little web server suddenly becomes

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,880
can get bad enough that it prevents you

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,560
from performing maintenance tasks on

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,140
your network you wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even be able</font>

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,990
to log in and shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,439
reconfigure the server or whatever if

26
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,140
your network that is experiencing this

27
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,740
problem is hosting other content from

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,420
other customers then it's denial of

service<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them as well and this is a</font>

30
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,799
real problem just the introduction this

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,720
morning John talked about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> newspaper</font>

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,240
here in New Mexico that received eight

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,350
million hits in one day this is the kind

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,298
of thing we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where all</font>

35
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,729
of a sudden you aren't really planning

36
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,940
on I'm having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people visit your</font>

37
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:04,870
website but

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:09,340
happen so what's something we can do

39
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:13,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this one way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to address it is to</font>

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:16,390
move the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the popular content closer to</font>

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">your network quarter so keep the traffic</font>

42
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:23,529
off the internal network keep those

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,899
links uncongested and try to serve the

44
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:35,920
the popular content right at the edge of

45
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:39,060
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide has a word that</font>

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,700
you may not be familiar with called

47
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,500
surrogate this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

48
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,030
call it demand-driven surrogate first

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,960
let's talk about what a surrogate is

50
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:56,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> text is from some pending IETF</font>

51
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:00,100
legislation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a surrogate is an</font>

52
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,130
intermediary program which acts as a

53
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,530
server or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tunnel for the purpose of</font>

54
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,250
responding to requests on behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one</font>

55
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,050
or more origin servers request their

56
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,010
service internally from a cash or by

57
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,250
tunneling them on to the origin servers

58
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:21,780
circuits are also traditionally known as

59
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,780
reverse proxies or server accelerators

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:31,770
so no really what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a surrogate the</font>

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,850
circus<font color="#E5E5E5"> is much like a proxy cache except</font>

62
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:38,460
that proxies act on behalf of users

63
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:43,140
while surrogates act on behalf of origin

64
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:46,230
servers or content providers a surrogate

65
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">is any sort of network element that that</font>

66
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,570
acts<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a server but may not be the</font>

67
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,630
authoritative source so a mirror site is

68
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,299
a pre-populated surrogate content

69
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:02,490
delivery networks such as Akamai<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 etc</font>

70
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:04,860
may provide surrogate services the

71
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:07,230
demand-driven surrogate is a system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

72
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,150
can be activated<font color="#E5E5E5"> only when popularity</font>

73
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,609
overloads the origin server or its

74
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,860
network so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an important point</font>

75
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,680
this is this is what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is about</font>

76
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,049
is activating something<font color="#E5E5E5"> only when you</font>

77
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">need it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and only for the amount of time</font>

78
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:21,440
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

79
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,180
this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're calling bellwether</font>

80
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,670
is based on a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of open source</font>

81
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:40,200
components so we use squid for caching

82
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:44,060
we use zebra for routing we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> FreeBSD</font>

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,789
for some IP file off the features and

84
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:51,720
the surrogate also configures the IP

85
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:56,550
firewall rules to divert new HTTP

86
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:59,700
connections to the squid process the

87
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,180
existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCP connections and non HTTP</font>

88
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:07,740
traffic are routed normally by the

89
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,270
surrogate over the GRE tunnel so this is

90
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">an important thing to keep in mind if</font>

91
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the surrogate is if the origin server is</font>

92
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,930
doing things besides HTTP if its

93
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,490
handling mail and DNS then there's going

94
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,340
to be a fair amount of other traffic

95
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,440
going through the surrogate although

96
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,810
simply routing packets is not a huge

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,560
overhead for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's not not going to</font>

98
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:34,950
kill performance another important thing

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to note is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP firewall in freebsd</font>

100
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:41,190
has some neat features where it keeps

101
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">per connection state so we can turn it</font>

102
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,419
on and only divert the new connections

103
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,300
and any connections that were

104
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:51,570
established<font color="#CCCCCC"> prior to that are handled</font>

105
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,330
the just just be a routing and similar

106
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:59,250
similarly when we turn it off new

107
00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:01,680
connections are sent just routed over

108
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,780
the GRE tunnel not sent to squid but the

109
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,280
connections<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were already said being</font>

110
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,280
sent to squid continue to go that way

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,380
after after it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> activated squid</font>

112
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:19,860
creates a cache of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the popular content</font>

113
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:22,590
for the origin server and any cache

114
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,880
misses are just tunneled over the GRE

115
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:30,060
tunnel that's what we've done it so cash

116
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,710
tips are served<font color="#E5E5E5"> from squid keeping a lot</font>

117
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,770
of the content off of the busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

118
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,979
and reducing the load on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the origin</font>

119
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,979
server

120
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,309
that's that's the basic plan now I'm

121
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to talk about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simulations</font>

122
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,930
that we did to convince ourselves that

123
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:57,970
it works and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it works reasonably</font>

124
00:06:49,930 --> 00:07:01,450
well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created a whole test network</font>

125
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:05,200
with about five systems and made the

126
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:06,909
origin server have some bottleneck so in

127
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,360
this case we configured its network

128
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,920
interface to be 10 base-t while all of

129
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,380
the other systems were 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

130
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,330
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created a workload of about nine</font>

131
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,520
hours worth of traffic for the first

132
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">hour it starts off low at about five</font>

133
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,539
requests per second and then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

134
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,539
increases to 100 requests per second

135
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:34,659
given that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin server has a 10</font>

136
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,729
base-t network with this workload it

137
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,740
should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle about about 50</font>

138
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,510
requests per second so we're really

139
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,310
pumping in a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests than it</font>

140
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:47,800
can handle the load stays high for about

141
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:52,270
two hours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it trails off over</font>

142
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:55,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next four hours and and continues on</font>

143
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,099
even a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that the ideal</font>

144
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,750
hit ratio for this workload was ninety

145
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,040
percent which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly reasonable</font>

146
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,419
for a an origin server with a nice you

147
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,690
know loads of a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> collection of</font>

148
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:10,719
content the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this is not</font>

here's 22 results two graphs the the red

<font color="#E5E5E5">the case without the surrogate and the</font>

158
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:49,550

<font color="#CCCCCC">ten seconds and the x-axis is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

161
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,470
so in the case without the surrogate

162
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:03,380
when the request rate increases response

163
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,810
time increases as well to a very

this way for most of the plateau and

168
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,960
then back down contrast that with the

169
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,349
the circuit case where it stays nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">where at this point the case without the</font>

174
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:37,390
surrogate actually has better response

175
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:40,580
time right so this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shows that</font>

176
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,610
there is an overhead to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better in in this area here</font>

179
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,710
this is when you would want to turn the

180
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,880
surrogate off and continue sending

181
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,880
packets via the normal route

182
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:06,160
so 100 bucks per second is pretty good

183
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,650
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not spectacular we</font>

184
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,780
wanted to prove to ourselves that we can

<font color="#CCCCCC">handle higher request rates so we use</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about 480 requests per second which on</font>

195

196
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:59,440
18 and 17 hours we slowly increase the

197
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,380
the request rate it starts out at about

198
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,960
390 and it keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> going until we see</font>

199
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,900
something bright so that break happened

200
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,980
here and we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our quarter and 80</font>

serving a lot of dynamic content and

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,760
this is not the greatest solution right

268
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,550
this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to help a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot if your</font>

270
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:55,790
there's two ways to to approach that you

could sort of leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as it is and what</font>

the surrogate refresh at the normal rate

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:06,560
that is supposed to also<font color="#E5E5E5"> since since the</font>

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,280
the surrogate would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing</font>

292
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,890
hitting the boers and server especially

293
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,910
if you have multiple border routers

294
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:01,260
coming into your network in that case

295
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,610
what I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about is you could</font>

296
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,340

is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the question gift Jules ok</font>

300
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:28,580
thank you i'll talk to you about this

301
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,580
