my opening comments I think one of the

74
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,420
things that's important is to make sure

75
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we walk away from here leaving</font>

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,290
something behind and we are we're

77
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,079
leaving infrastructure behind in the
