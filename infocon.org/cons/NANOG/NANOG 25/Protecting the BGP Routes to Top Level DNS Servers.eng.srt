00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,150
it did<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out to the general networks</font>

54
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,190
and from where we were sitting at our

adopted this route three of those ISPs

but we all know bad routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> escape out</font>

67
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,720
there and sometimes they hit servers the

ISP in question here wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

69
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,340
imitate a sea route server but you could

<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody was you can sort of</font>

direct a denial<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service or maybe</font>

director redirection of traffic attack

73
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,250
against some number of ISPs how well you

74
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,350
can control how far that spreads is an

75
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,760
interesting question but but certainly

76
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,859
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> its possibility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so we</font>

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,530
have kind of an interesting idea for a

78
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,720
solution here current BGP provides

79
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,900
dynamic routes which is certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,910
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here we are coming with Randy</font>

81
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,010
and myself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of academic</font>

82
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,200
people saying wait let's look again at

83
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,630
dynamic route so what we're doing is

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually trying the opposite extreme</font>

85
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,260
just to see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens so what we're</font>

86
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,030
going to do is we're going to say select

87
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,459
a single route to each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

88
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:36,630
servers so we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

89
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,640
25 fixed routes we use a s pass filters

90
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,290
to make sure that the only advertisement

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,109
we're going to accept so when that route

92
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,429
is gone we can't reach the server we're

93
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,530
also of course going to apply more

94
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,810
specific so that you can't sneak<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more</font>

95
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,150
specific route into to get around our

96
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,239
filter and this route is going to change

97
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,500
on a frequency of<font color="#E5E5E5"> months if at all so</font>

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not going to try to accommodate</font>

99
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,890
link failures we're not going to try to

100
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,750
do any kind of engineering traffic

101
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,940
engineering the only time we're going to

102
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:07,200
change is if root server IP address

103
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,690
changes so you know not frequently or

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,298
possibly maybe an<font color="#CCCCCC"> origin a s changes or</font>

105
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,220
we see some real legitimate change and

106
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,590
transit policy that we were forced to

107
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,358
adopt two and we're only going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjust</font>

108
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,238
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new route after we do offline</font>

109
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:24,260
verification right so essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

110
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,429
static routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 26 servers</font>

111
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so why is this even something</font>

112
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could consider in theory well</font>

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,880
there's a couple unique features here

114
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,550
that we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at first the scale of</font>

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,980
the problem is limited to a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

116
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,500
of routes we're looking at 25 routes

117
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,810
that actually did so they're 26 servers

118
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,960
but one shares<font color="#E5E5E5"> a prefix so we have 25</font>

119
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,780
total routes and we have no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

120
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,940
exponential growth if you count the

121
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,159
total number of top-level servers even

122
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,719
including things other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> commnet in</font>

123
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,110
or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still have no relatively small</font>

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,260
set and it's not growing not grown fast

125
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,090
at least we also believe that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

126
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to actually lose one of the routes to</font>

127
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">the servers for a while you know it's</font>

128
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,349
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> much better to have a lost</font>

129
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,560
route than a route pointing you to an

130
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,300
invalid server and we all know DNS will

131
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,100
will deal with the loss of a few servers

132
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,040
it's going to time out it's going to

133
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,080
retry whatever survives and as long as

134
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,060
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide that the surviving servers</font>

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,169
are able to handle the load and maybe

136
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,840
we're a little bit early to pay a little

137
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost and delay on timeouts the DNS is</font>

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,570
still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work we also claim that</font>

139
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,810
we believe there are some predictable

140
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,030
properties here these servers don't

141
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,550
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> without non-trivial effort right</font>

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this is not a web server</font>

this is a root server that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

146
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:53,789
it's fixed also we believe these fits in

147
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,940
places that have highly available

148
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:59,340
locations and you know part of the

149
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,020
ability to run a route or<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD is</font>

150
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,849
hopefully you you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,650
possibly you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you</font>

154
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,300
shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a root server so so</font>

155
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,190
in theory we believe maybe it's a good

156
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,690
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but of course the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way you ever</font>

157
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,240
really find out is you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

158
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,000
some actual data and so what we did is

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,300
we took an analysis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP updates using</font>

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,230
the right data set I think everybody's

161
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,670
probably heard of right because you

162
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,340
haven't basically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> archive of</font>

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:33,900

policy is hiding around and also one

175
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,600
unique feature of a lot of the

176
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,109
monitoring points is they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop</font>

177

bgp to connect a remote router to the

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,470
monitoring points here and basically

179
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,390
that's really pretty much unique to the

180
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,490
monitoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure and those</font>

our filter and you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lose</font>

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,380
some routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> because remember we're</font>

210
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,809
restricting you to specific static

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,000
routes so your<font color="#CCCCCC"> app goes away no backups</font>

212
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,489

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,590

214
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,060
so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to 75 percent of the time</font>

215
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,820
you get all 13 servers

216
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,189
but as you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to certainly 10</font>

217
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,279
servers the results with and without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

218
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,960

10 servers with the filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still</font>

220
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,100
reaching all of them without the filter

221
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,420
I'm still reaching all of them the

222
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,820
difference of course is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

223
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,020
ignore any any bogus routes that are

224
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,270
sitting out there when I apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

225
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,579
filter so I've actually gained something

226
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,620
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to try to claim that I</font>

227
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,670
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really paid a big penalty in</font>

228
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,380
terms of what I've lost now when I say

229
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,270
static routes I mean how static is

230
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,510
static right things do change in the

231
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,069
network and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> over our 14 month period</font>

232
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,010
for example if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the a root</font>

233
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:29,220
server we had to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> three manual changes</font>

234
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:31,860
to the filter we had to axonal valid

235
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:35,279
changes in origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s and a few other</font>

236
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,010
non valid but the two were really actual

237
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:43,410
occurrences May nineteenth the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

238
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:47,700
changed from 6245 to 11 8 40 or geneious

239
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,050
changed again on 640 one and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

240
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,700
those up those all belong with the

241
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization you would expect so these</font>

242
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">are legitimate changes we also saw one</font>

243
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,350
change in a transit ASI outing policy

244
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,660
that caused our filter to reject routes

245
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:04,589
and that's where somebody stopped

246
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:08,250
pretending as is number so 10 9 13 was

247
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:09,960
pretending it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

248
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,700
hindsight perhaps our filter could have

249
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,910
been a little little smarter to allow

250
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,560
that so that not sure that's really a

251
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:20,130
static change versus maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a oversight</font>

252
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,839
and filtering so but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

253
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,210
lose something so so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really got</font>

254
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,740
lost so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data set from</font>

255
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,010
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the study until that</font>

256
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,810
first AF<font color="#CCCCCC"> change where we switched pass</font>

257
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:37,560
our filter reduced the reach ability to

258
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:39,810
the a server from 99.99<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 to 99.9 04 but</font>

259
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,170
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw 18 events where the</font>

260
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,329
trusted route got lost and was withdrawn

261
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,729
two of these events resulted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp one</font>

262
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:51,209
actually losing connectivity to the

263
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,640
server so we had one event or 28 seconds

264
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:54,839
with no route<font color="#E5E5E5"> one event of 103 seconds</font>

265
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,250
in the round

266
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,680
now interestingly we only had eight

267
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,870
instances where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the backup route</font>

268
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,410
that survived for more than three

269
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,959
minutes and three minutes is a somewhat

270
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:12,040
magical number we took from some work by

271
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:13,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Craig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and sort of other once a possible</font>

272
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,339
point for saying this is maybe a

273
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,160
legitimate change versus this is not and

274
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,199
of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the backup rats we used the</font>

275
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,750
longest backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> route we had stayed</font>

276
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:24,910
around for 15 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

277
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,250
probably a legitimate or out the rest of

278
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,860
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes you may have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

279
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,160
actually throwing them away and these

280
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,990
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we have nine ISPs and 26</font>

281
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,719
servers so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> present these graphs</font>

282
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,279
all day but this is essentially a

283
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,259
representative one and on our website

284
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,290
and on a paper you're welcome to look at

285
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:47,199
more data so just to give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

286
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,480
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of what got filtered out so</font>

287
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,670
so here's one event we initially start

288
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,920
with this is our trusted route to the a

289
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:58,120
root server and I'm only selling the

290
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,779
tale of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS path trusted Ralph gets</font>

291
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,279
withdrawn and replaced by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy at</font>

292
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:06,279
1606 now our filter would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have dropped</font>

293
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,149
this but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP is still claiming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

294
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:13,420
reach the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh he lost a wheel</font>

295
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:17,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Austin is there but 36 about 30 seconds</font>

296
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:21,849
later we had another another path change

297
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:24,579
and yet another path change and then

298
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,670
finally we declare no route right so

299
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:29,019
this is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not unexpected in BGP I</font>

300
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,149
mean people who looked at bgp

301
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:33,790
convergence aren't going to be too

302
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,560
shocked by this result and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font>

303
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,019
fiber filter all those would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

304
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,050
thrown out and instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of declaring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

305
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:45,029
have no route at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1608 30 i would have</font>

306
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:47,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">declared i have no route at 1606 32 and</font>

307
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:48,970
you know in so in this case throwing

308
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:50,829
that away maybe he's not such a bad

309
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,600
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how much reach</font>

310
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:54,758
ability you really had in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that interval</font>

311
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,970
so even though our<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph look pretty</font>

312
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,160
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to claim that the results</font>

313
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,300
are even better if you consider when the

314
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,250
route really gets you to the server of

315
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,660
course there's always the worst case and

316
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,270
so of the nine this is

317
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,339
worst case in our study and and here you

318
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,970
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a drop in root server roots</font>

319
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,020
ability but i think is actually worth

320
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,080
thinking about and it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

321
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:23,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">worrying if you're this is p so</font>

322
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,290
initially this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> p</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 99</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the</font>

323
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,069
time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 13 servers you apply our</font>

324
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,900
filter and you only get<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 servers sixty</font>

325
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,090
percent of the time so forty percent of

326
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,569
the time you've lost at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or two</font>

327
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:40,300
servers and we only start to catch up

328
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:44,740
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real routing around six servers</font>

329
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:46,990
and you only need one assuming not

330
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,490
everybody switches to the same one so

331
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:55,170
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp would still work still</font>

332
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:57,970
yeah the other graph looked a lot nicer

333
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,920
so so where did this leave us just left

334
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">us with all right we don't actually want</font>

335
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come to nanog and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> propose put static</font>

336
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,790
routes in your backbone that's that's

337
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">not really what the the point of the</font>

338
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,810
talk is here but we do think that you

339
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,520
know there may be a balance to look at

340
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,729
here and some problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our approach</font>

341
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,460
are we did require in frequent updates

342
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,520
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter and this would have been</font>

343
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,050
especially useful to automate because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

344
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a natural tendency that if</font>

345
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,490
it's a task that must be done and is

346
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,850
done sort of periodically there tends to

347
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,650
be a tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to either forget the task</font>

348
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">or when it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes up forget what were the</font>

349
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,850
steps i did to update the filter so it'd

350
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">be nice to either update the filter</font>

351
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,850
frequently or automated also if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

352
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,610
allowed more than one path obviously we

353
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,440
improved robustness our simple filter

354
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,720
allowed only one<font color="#CCCCCC"> passed got pretty good</font>

355
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,120
reach ability we could have improved

356
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,220
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> p three draft tremendously if we</font>

357
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,960
had said let's allow two paths into our

358
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,480
filter because that is p was sort of

359
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,660
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> switching between a main path and</font>

360
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,100
a well-used backup so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

361
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,949
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is can you strike a</font>

362
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,570
balance between simply accepting any

363
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,790
route through a root server that someone

364
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,920
advertises and the other extreme of

365
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,439
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will only follow this known</font>

366
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,000
valid route to the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> and of course</font>

367
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a claim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have an</font>

368
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">algorithm to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and so the main</font>

369
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea behind the algorithm is just to</font>

370
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,508
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

371
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,310
slow down the dynamics and they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

372
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:27,100
optional verification depending on how

373
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,989
secure you want to be so we apply some

374
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,089
hysteresis before accepting a new path

375
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,949
so essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dynamics for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

376
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,079
routes are actually slower than what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

377
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:37,479
would get in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real internet and if</font>

378
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,729
you want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can throw in an optional</font>

379
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,649
module here to either leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

380
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,170
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it survived in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

381
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,639
a while use some probabilistic query in

382
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,199
response to make sure what you're

383
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,389
getting back from the server really is a

384
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,519
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer or maybe trigger some</font>

385
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:54,310
offline checking for instance bas of the

386
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,050
root server has moved let's ask the

387
00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,160
administrator if that makes sense and

388
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:03,008
maybe even male market bear sign or post

389
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,769
on nanog did did da trute server really

390
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:07,930
change and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details of</font>

391
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:09,850
the algorithm you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those in a</font>

392
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,579
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our website and i'll have a</font>

393
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,230
reference at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end here but but so</font>

394
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:16,899
what happens if you sort of try to

395
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:20,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">strike this balance between adaptivity</font>

396
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:22,720
and static routes and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is is t1</font>

397
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,579
and I think we've we've done a pretty

398
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,519
good job of improving overall reach

399
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:31,239
ability we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting 97 s % reach</font>

400
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,680
ability to 13 servers and even at 12

401
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,839
servers the difference i think is

402
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,399
negligible and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that losses</font>

403
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,620
routes that you wouldn't have used to

404
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,029
get to the server anyways you look at

405
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,160
the gTLDs a similar story what's more

406
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,750
encouraging is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was our worst case</font>

407
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,139
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still our feelings are worth</font>

408
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">worth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case and for isp 3 by just</font>

409
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:54,519
allowing a little bit of adaptation

410
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,040
we're able to still protect against the

411
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:59,319
forged route that or the misconfigured

412
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,599
route but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have a high degree of</font>

413
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:04,569
reach ability same story for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root</font>

414
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,240
servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> but for the gtld servers and so</font>

415
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:11,438
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly simple story but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

416
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,380
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully an interesting one so</font>

417
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,730
our conclusions basically are that look

418
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,289
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been we've been looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at data</font>

419
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,470
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a research perspective we're</font>

420
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:22,929
interested both<font color="#E5E5E5"> in securing BGP and</font>

421
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,319
securing DNS for however you might

422
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,939
define securing and here's sort of a

423
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,490
unique special case where maybe you

424
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,230
really can do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we did</font>

426
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,750
there is a potential

427
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,880
for denial of service so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

428
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,980
encourage people to it at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch</font>

429
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,100
this and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you are believing bogus</font>

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,300
worried that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do believe 13 bogus</font>

432
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">ralphs and you'd probably have 13 bogus</font>

433
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,840
routes from your table<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the wrong 13</font>

434
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,760
and you're in trouble and we propose<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

435
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,129
solution here a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the counter</font>

436
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,350
intuitive thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe dynamic graphs</font>

437
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,000
aren't all they're cracked up to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

438
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,550
certainly we want some dynamic

439
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,920
adaptation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to topology changes ability</font>

440
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,830
to use backup routes but let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider</font>

441
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,350
making these less dynamic this is

442
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,780
clearly limited to this problem we're

443
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,850
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and saying let's put</font>

444
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,260
a static route for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire table</font>

445
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,850
right this relies on the unique

446
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">properties of the root servers in</font>

447
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,100
particular scale ability to lose one and

448
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,830
the belief that these are highly

449
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,740
predictable and the stable locations and

450
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,710
we will lose some robustness to failure

451
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,420
so certainly anybody considering doing

452
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,490
this needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at your own topology</font>

453
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,080
and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have disjoint enough</font>

454
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">paths so that if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to filter</font>

455
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,960
you you allow yourself enough robustness

456
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,760
so that one link won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut all 13 root</font>

457
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,190
servers you fall over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup pass</font>

458
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,750
which aren't allowed in your filter but

459
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,900
that's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part our data says</font>

460
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,640
you won't be in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

461
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,450
gain some protection against invalid

462
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,540
routes and then also what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had hoped</font>

463
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,670
is maybe some some feedback from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

469
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:21,310
we'd be welcome feedback and certainly

480
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,939
the data we have says it seems to work

481
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,080
so we'd be very interested in any data

00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,390
servers sit in the same prefix right and

492
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,580
they have trouble with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

493
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,640
route so they pay a little extra penalty

494
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,610
there and for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> route essentially</font>

495
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,950
what they're doing is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's too</font>

497
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,600
they occasionally do lose their primary

509
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:10,450
have a good explanation from them as to

510
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,370
why that is why that is going away but

511
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,550
it is periodically going away and trying

512
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:18,699
to trying to back up that question

513
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:21,730
number two is how much does your data

514
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,820
change if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> start locking down the AAS</font>

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,840
path from one end and increasing by 1

516
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,210
right that's the locking down the entire

517
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,810
path what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dean own</font>

518
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:33,820
origin of the prefix and work your way

519
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,760
that way and conversely<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if you</font>

520
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:41,290
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what you know to be your best</font>

521
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,670
next hop a s and work that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

522
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,730
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's actually two interesting</font>

things there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one I mean there may be</font>

524
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,480
sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause and effect here that if</font>

525
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,879
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really did this we would see a</font>

526
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,960
much greater change in the dynamic of

527
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,900
the root servers which could in turn

528
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,640
change the results from our study and

529
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:05,890
learn faster absolutely yeah but i think

530
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know basically we we look at that i</font>

532
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,270
now what we can do is we can say you

533
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,370
know based solely on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know about</font>

this is what I select and if i do it i

get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> result we certainly we hope to</font>
