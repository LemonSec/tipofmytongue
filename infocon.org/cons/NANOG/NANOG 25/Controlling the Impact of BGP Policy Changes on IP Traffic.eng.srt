13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,379
the contributions of this worker are

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,800
really twofold the first is really what

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:54,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk about today so in this</font>

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:58,399
work we propose a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP traffic</font>

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:02,640
engineering practices that scale well

18
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:06,619
that allow operators to make predictable

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,750
changes to traffic flows and that do so

20
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:12,630
even in the presence of neighboring a

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,750
esas which may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things that you</font>

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:20,119
can't always predict so the second

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:25,350
contribution is is a tool for predicting

24
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:28,380
how you aggress rats change in response

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,720
to these BGP import policy changes using

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,589
an offline algorithm and I can refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,310
to some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work if you're</font>

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain traffic engineering might</font>

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,789
be interesting there's there's going to

31
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,039
be a panel on it tomorrow morning but

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,390
i'll give you a little primer now there

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,610
are several companies obviously they're

34
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,079
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing this these days but</font>

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,320
some of the main reasons you might be

36
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,960
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing this are if you have</font>

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,020
congestion on some of your edge links

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,139
you may wish to shift traffic around to

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,399
alleviate some of this congestion

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,649
there's provisioning changes on these

41
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,190
links<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may want to direct traffic you</font>

42
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,290
know towards links that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,840
provisioning has increased

44
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,390
and you may wish to alter the intent

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,290
path to various prefixes to achieve

46
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:25,140
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> n10 performance so in sloshing</font>

47
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,939
this traffic around there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really two</font>

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,879
main options you could shift traffic

49
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,608
among the links to a single a s or you

50
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:38,608
could shift traffic you know among all

51
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:40,709
your links maybe to a different is so

52
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk about good ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do both of</font>

53
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,220
these so the first thing to realize when

54
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,379
you're doing when you're sloshing this

55
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,599
traffic around is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to pay</font>

56
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,069
attention to you know where he's

57
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,369
flossing your traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> to because you</font>

58
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,089
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to violate commercial</font>

59
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,439
constraints certainly you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

60
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,849
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic on off one of your peering</font>

61
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,470
links because it's congested and then

62
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,319
end up sending it through one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:11,370
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like this so we got</font>

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:15,018
to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to this carefully so as</font>

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,449
a general overview we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

66
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:23,519
change our outbound traffic patterns by

next something else and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

73
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:40,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">any better ideas with what to bring it</font>

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with anyway so let's just stick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

75
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:48,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp and see what we can do so what types</font>

76
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:51,030
of bgp import policy changes are

77
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,879
considered good well there's there are

78
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,459
several criterion by which you can

79
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,138
consider a route or an import policy

80
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:04,019
change to be good or<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so good changes</font>

81
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,939
should really impose a minimal amount of

82
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,229
management overhead and also a minute

83
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:13,620
minimal amount of traffic as far as you

84
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:15,530
know sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> out new bgp updates the</font>

85
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,668
changes we make should result in

86
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,608
predictable changes in the traffic flows

87
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:23,479
and the changes we make should try to

88
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:26,099
minimize as much as possible

89
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:33,690
our neighbors reactions to our own

90
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes so really we're interested in is</font>

91
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:42,920
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to model what's coming out on our</font>

92
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:49,410
egress links as far as traffic loads

93
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:52,530
given five different inputs several<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

94
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:57,210
which operators have little to no

control over<font color="#CCCCCC"> it operators don't have</font>

96

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,490
that neighbors are giving to them at any

98
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:09,270
given time for a prefix not much control

99
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:14,370
over the network topology or you know

100
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:17,340
this limited control as to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quantity</font>

101
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,740
of the balance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic that you're</font>

102
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,599
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the inbound traffic links so</font>

103
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,930
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a few things that we can play</font>

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">with in response to this to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to shift</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">within our network and on the outbound</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">igp configuration within the network but</font>

109
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,800
when we're shifting traffic on these

110
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,830
outbound links it's generally easier to

111
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,110
do this with<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp import policies well</font>

how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even hope to model this or</font>

if router is not configured correctly

119
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:10,770
bgp decision process may not be

120
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,719
deterministic itself so so how can we

121
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of these inputs and and box</font>

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,490

123
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,330

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic loads so there's some further</font>

125
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,580
difficulties that we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font>

126
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,820
with the first is difficulties with the

127
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,979
protocol itself there's the message

128
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,820
advertisements don't include any sort of

129
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:38,110
metric as far as

130
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:41,150
as far as performance is concerned so

131
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:44,840
traffic engineering is essentially

132
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,159
manual this is the second set of

133
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,950

limitations with the BGP decision

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,180
process itself namely splitting traffic

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,810
in many instances can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be can be</font>

149
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,400
difficult and interacting with the I GPS

150
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,560
also introduces a fair amount of

151
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,120
complexity and there are also these

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:44,120
commercial relationship constraints

153
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:46,520
which I alluded to<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> posed</font>

154
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,230
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> before how to actually make</font>

155
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,690
some of these inputs more predictable

156
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:55,010
well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is is</font>

157
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,300
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure our routers are configured</font>

158
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:01,130
correctly so that given a static

159
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,760
snapshot essentially of our

160
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:07,490
configuration and of the set of routing

161
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,650
updates we're hearing we can predict

162
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,640
what type of rats are going to be

163
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:15,979
selected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to make the</font>

164
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,890
BGP decision process independent of the

165
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:25,240
ordering of message arrivals so BGP

166
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:27,620
deterministic med will will allow the

167
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,960
current best route advertisement<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

168
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,220
compared with all the other best all the

169
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,220
other route advertisements for that

170
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:37,220
prefix and therefore the ordering of

171
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:40,700
these arrivals does not affect which

172
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,500
route the router pics the second thing

173
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,630
we want to do is not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiebreaking</font>

174
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,100
based on the oldest route that we've

175
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,120
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a particular prefix but rather</font>

176
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,670
use

177
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,310
the router ID now the router ID itself

178
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,349
can can change if routers reboots or

179
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,000
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

180
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,029
interested in you know given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,060
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a snapshot at a particular time</font>

182
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:04,220
let's not have to simulate you know the

183
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,459
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of message arrivals let's assume</font>

184
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,100
this particular state and see what we

185
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:15,500
can see what we can predict as far as as

186
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:18,800
far as best routes so when we're playing

187
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this box and tweaking tweaking our</font>

188
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,140
inputs and trying to see where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

189
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,680
traffic is sloshing around<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we're also</font>

190
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:30,920
concerned with minimizing the overhead

191
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,640
so to achieve traffic engineering goals

192
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,750
we'd we'd also like to minimize the

193
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:41,569
frequency<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the changes that we're</font>

194
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:43,279
making in order to reduce the number of

195
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:49,730
BGP messages that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to send as</font>

196
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:51,529
well as operator headaches and we also

197
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,350
recommend enabling software

198
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:56,560
configuration or route refresh such that

199
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,580
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> a configuration changes made</font>

200
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,099
this session doesn't have to go through

201
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:04,640
a hard reset so given that we've sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

202
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,740
laid these basic ground rules the rest

203
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,620
of the talk basically focuses on how

204
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,810
we're going to adapt these<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP import</font>

205
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,420
policies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice ways such that we can</font>

206
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">predict what's going to come out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

207
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:22,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">box as far as how much traffic is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming</font>

208
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:26,209
out on each of our egress links so

209
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:30,770
really we propose sort of three main

210
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:33,290
areas which we want to focus one is that

211
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,689
it's important to consider the scale of

212
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:40,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problem we've got as many as a</font>

213
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:42,200
hundred thousand prefix prefixes and

214
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,750
several advertisements for each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

215
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,620
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have to set independent</font>

216
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:51,920
policies for each one to try to ship

217
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,830
traffic on a prefix by prefix basis this

218
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,060
would lead to particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> long and</font>

219
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,920
readable configurations and will likely

220
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">be unstable because</font>

221
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,479
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to predict how much traffic is</font>

222
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be destined for any one</font>

223
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,180
particular prefix at any<font color="#CCCCCC"> given time so</font>

224
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the second thing we're we're interested</font>

225
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,899
in doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is achieving some of some</font>

226
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,320
amount of predictability and I've

227
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:20,540
alluded to this a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit but there's</font>

228
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,459
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

229
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,279
when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make an import policy</font>

230
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:28,160
change particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if your neighbors</font>

231
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,230
see the effects of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> change this can</font>

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,300
affect inbound traffic patterns etc so

233
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,639
we'd like to limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the types of changes</font>

234
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can make such that when we do</font>

235
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,370
make a change we can predict where our

236
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,099
traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flow so the third</font>

237
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is we don't have much control over</font>

238
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,930
which routes our neighbors are

239
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,599
advertising to us some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attributes</font>

240
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:53,120
we don't have control over much control

241
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,220
over and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have much control over</font>

242
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,660
how much traffic our neighbors are

243
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:04,990
sending us on on which links so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

244
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:06,829
so what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that so</font>

245
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,829
basically look at these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three problems</font>

246
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:13,910
in the context of the data we have

247
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:16,219
available from the apmt backbone and see

248
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:20,170
what types of changes will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

249
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:24,560
than others under these three guidelines

250
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,729
so we look at routing table data which

251
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,199
give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of the advertisements</font>

252
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:32,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">were likely to see particular prefix we</font>

253
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,949
use use aggregated NetFlow data to

254
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out how much traffic is going to</font>

255
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">each particular prefix over these</font>

256
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:39,620
outbound links and we look at the

257
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,209
configuration files to see what types of

258
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:48,350
policies were applying to each of these

259
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:51,410
advertisements<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well not everyone</font>

260
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,560
works for eighteen t so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you do</font>

261
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,540
if you don't have this type of this type

262
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,199
of information available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you well you</font>

263
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:03,649
could use an ibgp monitor to get some

264
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:09,649
idea of the route advertisements that

265
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:12,949
are seen for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular prefix or some</font>

266
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,490
vendors supports sending all all the

267
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:18,359
advertisements heard for a particular

268
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,180
to ibgp monitor instead of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

269
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,300
flow you could use packet packet

270
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,859
monitoring or some other technique and

271
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">the analysis that we're presenting does</font>

272
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,520
apply even if you only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have limited</font>

273
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,370
access amount limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to this</font>

274
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,329
type of data so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem I</font>

275
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:42,330
alluded to was that we've got a large

276
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,920
number of prefixes we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather not have</font>

277
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set an import policy and everyone</font>

278
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,660
keep changing these as traffic patterns

279
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:54,620
change so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the traffic</font>

280
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:59,130
characteristics for these prefixes and

281
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:02,100
see which prefixes are carrying the

282
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,649
majority of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic and only said</font>

283
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,930
import policies for these prefixes or

284
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:10,890
these groups of prefixes so that's what

285
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,989
I've shown here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this graph on the</font>

286
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,510
y-axis we have a cumulative fraction of

287
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,510
traffic that that is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> carried for a</font>

288
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,270
particular prefix in blue or origin is

289
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,250
and red<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then on the x</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> axis we have</font>

290
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:29,189
the cumulative fraction of all

291
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:32,390

293
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,220
ten percent of prefixes are responsible

294
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,470
for terminating about seventy percent of

295
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,270
the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few group these prefixes</font>

296
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,360
according to the origin ass that

297
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,990
advertises them ten percent of the those

298
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,810

299
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,670
over eighty percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic so</font>

300
00:14:51,810 --> 00:15:00,180
ten percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin answers about</font>

301
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">1200 origin answers or so this is a much</font>

302
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">more manageable number than dealing with</font>

303
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">a hundred thousand prefixes</font>

304
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:13,360
so the second problem were interested in

305
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:16,690
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> is making predictable</font>

306
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,410
changes to the import policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

307
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:22,420
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is that the traffic that</font>

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">our neighbors are offering us on on our</font>

309
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:30,339
inbound links is changing over time so

310
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:34,810
if I'm changing import policies based on

311
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:38,770
these prefix advertisements the obvious

312
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:42,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution is to change our policies for</font>

313
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:45,280
the prefixes which carry roughly

314
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:49,330
predictable amount of traffic from week

315
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:52,120
to week so which prefixes are those

316
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:55,300
which which<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones carry a relatively</font>

317
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,830
predictable amount of traffic so it

318
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,800
turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if we look at the prefixes</font>

319
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,200
which carry the majority of the traffic

320
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,990
those tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more more stable than</font>

321
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:09,430
than the prefixes which carry less

these origin asses that that terminate

327
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,060
traffic as far as how much traffic they

328
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:31,359

329
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,739
percent change in the amount of traffic

330
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're terminating from week to</font>

331
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,800
week and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the origin answers that</font>

percent of all outbound traffic over

334
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:47,590
these links don't change by more than a

335
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:50,229
factor of two so so focusing your import

336
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:53,830
policy changes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> only these sets of</font>

prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be likely to give you more</font>

338
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,390
predictable output as far as how much

339
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:05,050
traffic you're carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> on each of these</font>

340
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:06,520
links okay so that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next sort of</font>

341
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,869
problem we deal with when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at</font>

342
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,639
predictability is that when we make some

343
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:16,989
some import policy change that affects

344
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,540
up a router choice for best route that

345
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,559
change may be visible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our downstream</font>

346
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,188
neighbors

347
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,349
and and that change may cause them to

348
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:28,899
intern change their mind on whether

349
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:32,649
sending their traffic so in this in this

350
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:36,340
diagram if I've if I've made some change

351
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:39,820
that changes the path for a best route

352
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,860
from ASB and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's now using a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

353
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,320
downstream neighbor may decide oh I'm

354
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to send traffic to to my</font>

355
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:51,428
network at all this is going to wreak

356
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:55,269
havoc as far as generating predictable

357
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:57,389
impound inbound traffic matrix so in

358
00:17:55,269 --> 00:18:00,399
order to alleviate this kind of problem

359
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:03,070
we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make import policy changes</font>

360
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:06,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">that shift traffic either to the same a</font>

361
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:10,178
s or if we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shift</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a different</font>

362
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:11,710
is at least shift to a path that uses

363
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,960
the same path length so this is less

364
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:21,220
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change your downstream</font>

365
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:27,759
neighbors choice for best route<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

366
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:29,619
what this graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> is showing is it's the</font>

367
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:39,240
cumulative fraction of traffic and

368
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:39,240
prefixes for so forgiven forgiven

369
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:47,610
basically we can see from the graph that

370
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:52,719
about seventy percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the prefixes</font>

371
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:56,529
have only one distinct next hop is for

372
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:00,490
that among the path stay here for

373
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:03,029
shortest path advertisement so this is

374
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice because this means that we can play</font>

375
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:09,899
games with our import policies and as

376
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:14,470
long as we shift among paths that are

377
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:16,629
all this all the length of the shortest

378
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,340
passes all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

379
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:22,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our traffic is going</font>

380
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,799
to slosh to a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hop is</font>

381
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:32,980
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next problem we have to deal with</font>

382
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:35,259
is that operators typically want to

383
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,259
shift traffic aggregates on some finer

384
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:42,190
granularity<font color="#CCCCCC"> than than on a per AF basis</font>

385
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:45,749
but on a more coarse granularity<font color="#CCCCCC"> than /</font>

386
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:52,509
path so for example they'll pick out a

387
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:54,129
chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic like a unit sprint path</font>

388
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:56,259
or something like this and shift all

389
00:19:54,129 --> 00:20:00,340
that traffic away from from a particular

390
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:04,389
link<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the problem with just with</font>

391
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:07,168
doing this naively is that if you if you

392
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:10,090
pick a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> too hot path and</font>

393
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:13,440
somebody two hops down from you decides

394
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change change their advertisement</font>

395
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,139
then the policy that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> just said it</font>

396
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:24,820
has become invalidated or not applicable

397
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:27,729
rather so what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is use</font>

398
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,070
regular expressions to try to figure out

399
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:38,860
or try to try to alleviate this problem

400
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:41,408
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> flapping downstream so that the</font>

401
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,908
main thing to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful of when we do</font>

402
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:51,220
this sort of thing is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it a</font>

403
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:54,789
701 you know /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8701</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> n hop is not it's</font>

404
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,460
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same as a 701</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> M hop there are</font>

405
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,499
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of networks and the</font>

406
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:04,019
amount of traffic that's terminated over

407
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:07,149
networks of different paths can vary so

408
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:09,159
you can probably if you're feeling

409
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:11,498
astute you could probably figure out who

410
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,779
each of these assr but the point of this

411
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:16,090
the point of this graph basically shows

412
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:17,889
how much traffic is terminated to each

413
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:22,209
of these a esas over various path length

414
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:23,678
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a SC terminates a hundred</font>

415
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,879
percent of its traffic over one hot

416
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:32,320
paths whereas someone like something

417
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:33,969
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SI terminates only twenty percent</font>

418
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,220
of its traffic over one hot paths and

419
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know another twenty five percent</font>

420
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">or another thirty percent</font>

421
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,049
over over<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hot paths so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

422
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,960
if I want to shift to hot paths to some

423
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:49,030
particular ASI have to be careful about

424
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,820
what some<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular is is because the</font>

425
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,490
change i make could have vastly

00:21:51,820 --> 00:22:01,720
different impact depending on which is

427
00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:05,530
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the last challenge we're</font>

428
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,440
trying to address is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:15,340
us and the as path length step in the

432
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,100
decision process comes fairly early and

433
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:23,860
by default it's it's not something we

434

have much control over further<font color="#E5E5E5"> in many</font>

435
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,168
cases just not clear what the difference

436
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:36,610
is between a two-hot path and the three

437
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:38,080
hot path so well in in particular when

438
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,399
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shift traffic for to</font>

439
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,710
achieve various traffic engineering

440
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:48,460
goals using sort of a strict ass path

441
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,900
length rule ends up restricting our

442
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,290
flexibility because we're ruling out

443
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:57,160
paths that we may want to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

444
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:58,389
to offload our traffic to or from so if

445
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,270
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this sort of thing we</font>

446
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,780
recommend turning off the a s path

447
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:07,299
length step and using a more<font color="#E5E5E5"> coarse</font>

448
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,700
definition or using sort of a more

449
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,280
coarse<font color="#CCCCCC"> grained metric to apply to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

450
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:15,220
path length step maybe say you know two

451
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,080
or three hot paths are roughly

452
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:22,260
equivalent but you know definitely

453
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:26,678
prefer those over five hot path<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

454
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:30,370
so what we're showing here is how many

455
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:35,620
how many prefixes here advertisements

456
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:38,290
that here advertisements with paths of

457
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:42,668
more than one distinct length so we see

458
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:44,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little more of a little</font>

459
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:45,970
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty five percent of all the</font>

460
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,489
traffic and a little more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty</font>

461
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">five percent of all prefixes here</font>

462
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,800
advertisements for more than one

463
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,560
distinct length so

464
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,540
this you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a traffic engineering</font>

465
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:00,230
mindset this should raise some flags

466
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:03,159
because in this for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty five</font>

467
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:07,910
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prefixes that we want to</font>

468
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,550
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> slosh around we may be restricting</font>

469
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,410
the choices that we have as far as our

470
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,879
egress links by ruling out you know a

471
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,280
particular three hot path because

472
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,710
there's there's a two-hot path that

473
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,250
looks better<font color="#E5E5E5"> by by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP decision</font>

474
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:25,130
process this is this often you know a

475
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,980
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these multiple lengths paths do</font>

476
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,660
come about because of of prepending and

477
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,910
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font>

478
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:37,400
about next so the issue with with

479
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:42,410
prepending is there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

480
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:47,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of prepend vigorously it</font>

481
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:51,500
prepending 12 ER or 14 times is it

482
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens and it's unclear with</font>

483
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,970
the differences between someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

484
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,490

485
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,800
prepended or out eight times as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as</font>

486
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,920
doing traffic engineering if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

487
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,780
keep our options open we we don't

488
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily want to prefer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven hot</font>

489

path<font color="#E5E5E5"> liver and a hot bath why don't we</font>

490
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">just consider those to be equally good I</font>

491
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,910
mean we definitely want to prefer prefer

492
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,850
one or two hot path over seven hot path

493
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:23,630
that using such a coarse-grained metric

494
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:25,129
can restrict operators flexibility this

495
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,280
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we're really</font>

496
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:31,880
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is things that our</font>

497
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,940
neighbor is has made<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to try to play</font>

498
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,690
games with us and restrict our

499
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:43,010
flexibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in choosing outbound</font>

500
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:45,220
routes games like filtering on some

501
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,360
peering points and not others

502
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,660
advertising the next top IP address it's

503
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:55,370
not of the session itself but you know

504
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:58,700
somewhere across your backbone we didn't

505
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:01,659
see this happening that much but if you

506
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,660
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

507
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:06,469
causing you some headaches so definitely

508
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:08,149
something to look out for so pay

509
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:09,859
attention pay attention to your

510
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:15,678
advertisements at least if you haven't

511
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:20,478
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> paying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attention to me okay so in</font>

512
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:23,330
conclusion we're pretty much stuck with

513
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:24,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP so we need to figure out how to do</font>

514
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain traffic engineering with it</font>

515
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:29,090
and that's basically what I've been

516
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:32,299
talking about today what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are what are</font>

517
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">good types of import policy changes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

518
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:37,849
result in good scaling properties that

519
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:40,759
result in predictable changes in traffic

520
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:42,649
flow and that allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

521
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:44,539
despite the fact that our neighbors may

522
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:46,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">be sending us things that we don't want</font>

to hear or or misbehaving in various

524
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:54,919
ways as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned there's also a tool</font>

527
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:04,309
refer you to the paper that's also

530
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:17,259
also smoking a few other things and this

531
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:20,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this is a shameless advertisement</font>

532
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:23,509
some of the work I'm doing as a graduate

533
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:25,700
student<font color="#CCCCCC"> at MIT involves answering some</font>

534
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:27,710
questions like observing correlations

between<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP advertisements and</font>

536
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:34,460
end-to-end past failures but to observe

537
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:37,849
these correlations we need to have

538
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,759
places to observe them from so that's

539
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:42,830
where you come in Randy bushes all has

aww

547
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:18,810
since you mentioned the analogy for

smoking stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh who is funding your</font>

government

551
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:46,060
was anyone paying attention how do you

552
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:47,590
leaving you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:54,179
apply this now since there's no argument
