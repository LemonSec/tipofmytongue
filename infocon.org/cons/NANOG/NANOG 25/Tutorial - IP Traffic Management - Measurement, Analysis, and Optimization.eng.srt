1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,890
and we along with my friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> here are</font>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,919
here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a IP traffic</font>

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,170
management applications we were in Miami

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,370
I think I recognized some faces from

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,559
Miami and we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,500
technical detail about how to collect

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,619
and scenarios<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> collecting data to do</font>

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain traffic engineering and</font>

9
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,800
some of the feedback we got from that

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,660
was that gosh some real case studies

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be a whole lot would sort of be</font>

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,109
valuable in doing this so what we tried

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,029
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time was expand the scope a</font>

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,560
little bit to go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> just technical</font>

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,320
you know what are some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font>

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,329
statements and what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,399
applications you can do with this stuff

19
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then actually show some examples</font>

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,530
about how people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using this sort of</font>

21
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,239
technology to answer questions so given

22
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">all that I titled this IP traffic</font>

23

25
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,600
again my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Josh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chapman I work for</font>

26
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">xeo we have Andrew Lang from Exodus and</font>

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,359
or cable and wireless matt meyer from

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:10,729
in height order ranking so so when we

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">were in Miami some time back sistahs</font>

31
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:17,789
februari we defined a process for for

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,650
solving problems using the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,210
technology and started with defining

34
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,759
goals you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know clearly defining a</font>

35
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,679
problem statement so that as you went to

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,119
measure data you knew what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,729
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to group it and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font>

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,100
it so defining a goal defining a problem

39
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,780
statement selecting a measurement scheme

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,880
and then going<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward and measuring in</font>

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,159
your network the right data points<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,829
the right data objects analyzing your

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,329
data in a sane fashion and then refining

44
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,039
your goals based on your analysis and

45
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actions you solve your</font>

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">original problem statement and then you</font>

47
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,360
know go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and start again and that</font>

48
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,549
was that was applied specifically to

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain traffic engineering back in</font>

50
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">Miami so I personally learned a few</font>

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,369
things from the Miami presentation one

52
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,689
is that more detail on problem

53
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,430
statements and measurement schemes

54
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">seemed to be what people wanted to hear</font>

55
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">more about some real examples in case</font>

56
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,670
studies<font color="#CCCCCC"> of applied solutions would be</font>

57
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,280
helpful and that sometime

58
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,010
I start to talk really fast and that I

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,880
should talk more slowly so feel free to

60
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,760
remind me if I forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

61
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,560
so you know what am I talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

62
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,269
goal here is to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a broader set</font>

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,340
of applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist for routing</font>

64
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,440
and flow data correlation there's just

65
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,209
users darn near an infinite number of

66
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,459
things you can do with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data set and</font>

67
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,200
yet remarkably few people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so you</font>

68
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,910
know defining some problem statements

69
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,649
and defining some some scope of

70
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,870
measurement seems like it would be a way

71
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help people get into doing this stuff</font>

72
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,100
so very specifically I wanted to focus

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,000
on what are the problem statements you

74
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,680
know what are the things what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,120
business related problems we're trying

76
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,620
to solve and then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

77
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,989
measurement issues and the scale issues

78
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:01,209
in designing solutions to those problems

79
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:02,319
that loud enough yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I really</font>

80
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,489
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on those first two</font>

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,510
things because that seems to be where

82
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:09,190
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions came from so when</font>

83
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,989
we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our problem statements and</font>

84
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,819
solutions solutions have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

85
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,530
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do they need to solve</font>

86
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,149
real business problems you know I mean

87
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,459
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of live in an economic</font>

88
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,930
environment now we're solving problems

89
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:23,140
that aren't really economically based

90
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know kind of take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backseat so the</font>

91
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,828
problems we're solving has to sort of

92
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know cut costs for drive revenue and</font>

93
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:30,609
I'm an engineer at heart but you know

94
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,930
there I can be an engineer all day and

95
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,519
not end up working for our company at

96
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there's just</font>

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">some sort of bottom line economics here</font>

98
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,540
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I see a lot happening</font>

99
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,760
are some things that I see happening a

100
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,850
lot is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the solutions that</font>

101
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,440
are proposed to problems the solutions

102
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,269
are more expensive than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font>

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,459
and that's something that I ran into as

104
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,109
an engineer a lot is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I identified a</font>

105
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,790
problem I would identify a solution and

106
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it turned out that when I feel far down</font>

107
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,819
to cost the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far more</font>

108
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive than the problem you know</font>

109
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:02,518
finding economically same solutions to

110
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,829
problems just a major thing these days

111
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,540
and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know finally it needs to</font>

112
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,090
provide relevant engineering data has to

113
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,798
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem statement relevant and you</font>

114
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,269
know it's really easy to go overboard

115
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,130
and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and collect everything</font>

116
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,899
underneath the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun and you end up</font>

117
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,668
collecting so much data that you run out

118
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,440
of disk run out of memory you need too

119
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,130
many boxes and it comes to expensive way

120
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,170
too fast

121
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,620
so the goal of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing here at</font>

122
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,150
least what I see it as is that by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

123
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,610
time I'm done talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this stuff</font>

124
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,169
as Andrew and Matt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe get up to do</font>

125
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,330
their case studies we should have enough

126
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,490
information fresh in your mind to apply

127
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,219
whatever your problem statements are and

128
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,660
whatever your network design is you

129
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,700
should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply what you have</font>

130
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,760
locally to what they're talking about us

131
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know that's helpful for you</font>

132
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,469
hopefully that's what happens so I came

133
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list of applications</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

134
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,320
thought would be interesting to talk

135
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,480
about in terms of business problems to

136
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,610
solve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one being interred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

137
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">inner domain peering optimization I mean</font>

138
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,820
everyone here needs to expand or

139
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,000
contract they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering in some</font>

140
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,190
capacity or at least make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it work to the</font>

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,410
best of your ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain</font>

142
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,610

144
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that problem customer acquisition that</font>

145
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,120
seems to be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people talk a</font>

146
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,910

147
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,610
but a network policy enforcement intro

148
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,900
domain traffic engineering and there's a

149
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,450
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of others that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will touch on</font>

150
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,489
briefly the reason we didn't call this

151
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,530
inter domain traffic engineering and

152
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,460
inter domain applications is that you

153
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,869
know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pretty interesting</font>

154
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,150
uses of this stuff within your own

155
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,860
network as Andrew will talk about so we

156
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,810
sort of broadened broadening the scope

157
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,090
language super network there is a

here if anyone has questions please ask

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,849
whenever you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> the urge this is sorry</font>

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have many questions so again</font>

163
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,650
every application follows the same model

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">you define a goal you measure</font>

165
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:05,429
appropriate data you analyze it refine

166
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,870
your goals and you take action<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

167
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the focus of what I want to talk</font>

168
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,050
about is defining your goals and then

169
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,640
you're a measurement scheme and

170
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,860
specifically for your measurement scheme

171
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,440
what is your network scenario or what is

172
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,150
a network scenario to consider what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,590
the deployment scenario for that network

174
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,320
design and then what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

175
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,619
implications of your deployment scenario

176
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,409
on your network scenario and it's what I

177
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,270
get asked most often is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much just do</font>

178
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,870
I need how much memory do I need how

179
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">many collectors do I need you know</font>

180
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,020
what are the hardware requirements what

181
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,090
are the one of the hard numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font>

182
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,159
to know and the answer is always the

183
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,440
same it just depends on a ton of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,510
and some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things are quantifiable</font>

185
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,920
some of them or not and all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them will</font>

186
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,960
depend on what your network looks like

187
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,090
so my goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to help you figure out</font>

188
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,590
those answers for yourself because you

189
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,719
know I will never know the answers and

190
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ask outside of your network</font>

191
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,320
will ever know the real answers there is

presentation happy to answer them so the

202
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">first problem statement that I thought</font>

203
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,820
we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain peering</font>

204
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,370
optimization the problem statement for

205
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,990
that as I sort of see it as reduce your

206
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,850
inner domain transit costs while

207
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,490
increasing quality of connectivity you

208
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,350
know clear business win there you reduce

209
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,830
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost it's cheaper you gain finer</font>

210
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,600
game you gain finer<font color="#E5E5E5"> grain control of</font>

211
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,960
your traffic and while that can increase

212
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,880
the complexity you know nobody here you

213
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,950
know complex bgp implementations knew

214
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,930
that is anybody here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think you</font>

215
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,370
end up getting closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your end tufts</font>

216
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,110
consumers in terms of the traffic

217
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,110
they're sending across your network both

218
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,030
on net and off net and and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

219
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,700
a clear cost savings it's an

220
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,770
economically sane approached appearing

221
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,930
that solves the real problems instead of

222
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">guessing who you know quantifiably who</font>

223
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,930
and you can make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> based on</font>

224
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,270
whether that's economically viable for

225
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,040
you or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for more information you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

226
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,409
see Bill Martin who's sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in</font>

227
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,240
the front row of the art<font color="#CCCCCC"> appearing and I</font>

228
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,310
actually thought this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really funny</font>

229
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,200
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote it Sun Tzu's the art of war</font>

230
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:31,720
because appearing can be sort of a pain

231
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,640
sometimes so a network scenario for

232
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,190
appearing optimization I chose a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

233
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,500
generic generic one a hierarchical

234
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,930
network design where you have core

235
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,000
transit facilities and you're on that

236
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">off net traffic comes in that some edge</font>

237
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,680
box whether it be appearing router or

238
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,939
gateway router of

239
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,609
webhosting router or whatever it might

240
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,950
be your peers are not offered transit

241
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,800
services and your primary concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> is out</font>

242
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,500
loud load so you know a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font>

243
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,149
of that is here you have some number of

244
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,860
transit routers each edge router is

245
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,680
multihomed into a set of core routers

246
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:07,040
and those border routers connect you to

247
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,399
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> asses which things might do to</font>

248
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,260
other answers so a deployment scenario

249
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,959
for this problem statement considering

250
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,630
that that network design specifically

251
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,819
specifically for flow export is that you

252
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,980
would collect flow flow data on the core

253
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,600
access links you know all the traffic

254
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,070
presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your core to your edge</font>

256
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,630
to your peers the sampling granularity

257
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,520
can be you know moderate<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and 51 and</font>

101 and 500 you're doing long-term

259
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,399

correlate to the flow information you're

309
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,210
collecting we'll get into that a little

310
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,360
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a second so here's a</font>

311
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,339
slightly modified picture from before as

312
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,560
I said works liking flow data from the

313
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,959
core access links you know inbound on

314
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,910
links on the border routers that connect

315
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,099
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transit routers that allows us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

316
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,540
see all outbound traffic without having

317
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,810
to collect on some large number of

318
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,329
interfaces that's what makes this design

319
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,619
model really you know work well with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

320
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,940
sort of problem statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

321
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,320
have a low number of links which means

322
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,750
it you're putting less load on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

323
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,279
router which means you're you know it's

324
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,589
a win everywhere you see all the traffic

325
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,300
and then we're simply doing ibgp from

326
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,330
those routers because all we need those

327
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,280
routers to do is pass ebgp installed

328
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,080
routes to us

329
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,380
so deployment implications for inter

330
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,330
domain peering optimization the number

331
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,980
of collection notes you need low to

332
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,810
moderate depending on how many peering

333
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,820
locations you have flow export is

334
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,500
obviously UDP based so you don't want to

335
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,510
transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the halfway across the world if</font>

338

339
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,420

number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of boxes you need pretty low</font>

343
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,400
which means the requirements for those

344
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,800
boxes will also be low disk usage

345

export version obviously version 5 is

387
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,210
going to be a whole lot chattier than

version 8 in terms of cpu load again

389
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,250
it's pretty low you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is</font>

a pretty low scale question

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,910
the AAS pass realm we're usually talking

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,070
about traffic going from your local

<font color="#E5E5E5">make peering decisions based on how</font>

that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really really hard</font>

413
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,760
question to answer mostly because when

414
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,040
you're mapping rounding routing data to

415
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,540
a destination IP address there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very</font>

your traffic will be delivered or at

419
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,560
least it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be almost all the time</font>

420
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,589
because every<font color="#E5E5E5"> router in the past had to</font>

421
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,589
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to install that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router fact in order</font>

422
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:43,420
propagated along to you mapping routing

weak correlation to the forwarding paths

425

you don't know how the source<font color="#CCCCCC"> is send</font>

426
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,520
traffic to you you only know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font>

427
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,720
would forward it back to them and if the

428
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,550
odds are very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's an</font>

429
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,130
asymmetric path so if you were to

430
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,290
collect routing data / AF path to the

<font color="#E5E5E5">source AF you would get lots of</font>

436
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just can't do it most most</font>

437
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,480
routes in the internet have a single

438
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:18,250
origin is so you can usually say that

439
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct and if you're collecting</font>

440
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,390
on appearing link to say provider ex and

441
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,370
you saw the flow come across that link

442
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,780
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it came from provider ex so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

443
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,100
can say make intelligent statements

about your neighbor and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

intelligent statement about the source

446
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:34,400
it's just sort of that middle mile

447
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's very tough to do make sense</font>

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so problem statement number two</font>

449
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,000
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really close to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first one</font>

mitigation you no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem statement here</font>

452
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,900
is save money by identifying and

00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,670
know my link to provider ex is full I am

464
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:17,060
you need to fix sometimes for those

return on investment here is very clear

Holly higher quality of service and

481
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,090

just very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to hearing</font>

about that specific spot in my network

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,540
and it requires retention<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more detail</font>

498
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,580
to answer more specific questions that

00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,700
has implications for our for our

500
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,230

501
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,730

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk uses just moderate and I say I</font>

505
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,710
say it increases here because even

506
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,549
though the time with which you're

507
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,259
keeping data may decrease

508
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:50,519
of different kinds of traffic or the

509
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,879
number of different kinds of data you

510
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,169
might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep increases and so you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know the more tables you collect more</font>

00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:59,249
district and end up using and the CPU is

513
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,049
generally low you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it grows</font>

514
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:03,090
with the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interfaces and it</font>

515
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:04,889
grows with the flow diversity and it

516
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,049
grows with you know depending on which

517
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:09,988
bgp model you have but again doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

518
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:11,580
is a pretty low resource problem to

519
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:15,210
solve it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's not that</font>

520
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">big a deal so the third one is customer</font>

if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should put this in here but it</font>

523
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,489
comes up a lot so I thought I'd mention

524
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,749
it the problem statement is you know

525

increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> revenues by identifying</font>

530
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,669
I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in this you know</font>

531
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:40,230
privately I know a lot of people who you

00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:41,940
know try and target customers with their

534
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,289
every market so you know I mean when it

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,239
comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> right down to it anyone not in</font>

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:11,220
so you increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> your revenue and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this you'll have different questions and</font>

00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:04,690
and perhaps outbound on links and on

728
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:08,150

748
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:52,340
selected as active so ideally it would

749
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,990
just be really great if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could if you</font>

750
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,520
could evaluate every single route that

751
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,980
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your domain from every edge</font>

752
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,040
that way you can catch candidate routes

753
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,510
that aren't selected at some edge router

754
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,159
but that do represent a problem such

755
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,680
that if they ever did get installed you

756
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,440
might you might face an outage so that

757
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,090
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> currently exist in BGP another</font>

758
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,670
question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get a lot from people is</font>

759
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,419
well juniper has this thing called

760
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,890
advertising active and that's how i

761
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,480
would get all that information so it's

762
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what that command does even</font>

763
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,500
though the documentation seems to tell

764
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,379
you that's what it does this is no

765
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:28,040
facility in BGP for me as a neighbor to

766
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:30,440
announce you some routes from mnl RI and

767
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,480
then send you that same nlr I again it's

768
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,770
anatomically different unit it would be

769
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,050
an implicit replacement there's just no

770
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,680
way in BGP to currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that but</font>

771
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:42,440
luckily the IETF is you know moving very

772
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,810
slowly at solving this problem and there

773
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,220
are two internet-drafts that you know

774
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:50,240
are out there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to prove if you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">yes no you know you're you're asking a</font>

824
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:40,849
binary question is this happening or if

825
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:42,739
it's not happening I don't really care

826
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:44,599
how much it's happening if my neighbor

827
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">is cheating me I don't need to know the</font>

828
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:48,320
magnitude of it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply need to</font>

829
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:51,080
determine that it's happening or not and

830
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,580
for a lot of the stuff v5 is preferable

831
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,320
because you get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your raw flow</font>

832
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,359
data which means you can ask a lot more

833
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,418
questions if you're using v8 or the

834
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:00,349
forthcoming v9 that you can ask a lot

835
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:02,400
less questions because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

836
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:05,010
getting the summer examples

837
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,750
so the deployment implications for

838
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,879
network policy enforcement and I'm

839
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking of this on a large scale you</font>

840
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,220
know the collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> nodes becomes</font>

841
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,510
moderate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> high because you're</font>

842
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,890
collecting off a lot of interfaces

843
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:18,180
you're collecting a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp sessions</font>

844
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,190
the disk usage is pretty high because

845
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,830
you're you're saving raw flow data

846
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,930
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the summary tables again you</font>

847
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,120
know how long do you keep that data is a

848
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,340
major issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> in disk usage as it is</font>

849
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,750
storage the floor version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've mentioned</font>

850
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,189
a couple times<font color="#CCCCCC"> out this is probably</font>

851
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,670
common Alice to most people but for

852
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">those who isn't version five sends all</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> raw flow records out to you version</font>

855
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,689
a summary tables but there's a resource

856
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,840
trade off their version 8 is a whole lot

857
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:51,090
more router intensive in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font>

858
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but it offloads the collector</font>

859
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,429
side and it offloads the network transit

860
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,470
load but version 5 is a lot less work on

861
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:00,450
the routers but there's a lot more

862
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,580
collection side load and there's a lot

863
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,850
more you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic on your back home</font>

864
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,560
so you know things to keep in mind

865
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,790
number of interfaces again the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

pretty high cpu load for this in terms

is in for domain traffic engineering

880
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,680
which is obviously slightly different

kind of expensive to do and doing this

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,210
sort of thing is able to address a lot

not a replacement it was simply an

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,159
alternative and we just don't have

to have the never ending is mpls a good

or a bad thing debate to which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can not</font>

00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:29,769
argue either side<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the network</font>

899
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:32,529
scenario for this you know some

900
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:34,799
arbitrary set of igp links you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

901
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:37,089
selects the exit<font color="#E5E5E5"> point for your network</font>

902
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,889
it works in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> conventional</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

903
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:40,658
paradigm where I GP scary and for domain

00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:42,668
traffic to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP next top exit point</font>

905
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:44,799
if your network is not designed like

906
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:47,109
this this will not work so well because

907
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,319
it's based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notion of a driving</font>

909
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:54,369
so most networks I've seen run like this

910
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:59,289
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some that do not for those</font>

that do not you know have that mpls so

infra domain traffic engineering

913
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:04,269
deployment scenario for flow you're

914
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:06,879
going to collect flow data from the edge

915
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:08,469
ingress links of substance yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

916
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:10,480

917
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,859
interface all over your network that

918
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,539
makes the scale go through the roof and

919
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:14,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you know again it becomes a solution</font>

920
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:18,700
which is more expensive than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

921
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:20,168
so don't sweat the small stuff and just

922
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the hierarchical network model</font>

923
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:23,888
we looked at you may have you know

00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:29,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousands of customer links on a given</font>

925
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:30,460
router but you may only have two links

926
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,750
into the core collecting on those two

927
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,500
aggregation links makes it a whole lot

928
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier than measuring every single edge</font>

929
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,069
link and since you're concerned here is

930
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:41,200
traffic mapping onto your network not

931

necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual source interface</font>

932
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,328
you know you can scale a lot better<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

933
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:48,099
doing that again the sampling right here

can be moderate this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not billing</font>

you're likely following an ibgp learned

1011
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,299
routing do not do it does not print

1012
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,759
money it will not correct accounting

despite what you may have heard

1017
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,029
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are funny you know so</font>

1018
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,069
basically in summary there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1019
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:49,589
there's just a truckload of applications

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be that can help you save money</font>

1021
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:54,480
and make money by collecting data that

1022
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:56,220
exists on your network both flow and

1023

routing data and active measurement

1024
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,598
though that we didn't cover<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here and</font>

that you know they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">almost every scenario there's a way to</font>

not a very engineering thing to say I

1032
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,160
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it affects everybody here most</font>

1033

things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always hear about is the I can</font>

1048
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:11,879
eat account my packets or i can forward

1049
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:14,670
my packets and that was wondering if you

1050
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,770
have any any doedel evidence of stories

1051
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,660
about where that point is where you

1052
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,060
don't seem to have quite as much of an

1053
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,210
affect the way you see the routers kind

1054
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,920
of falling over right you know the

1055
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,570
standard vendor answer to I want better

1056
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,130
accounting on my routers as well we can

1057
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,359
give you better accounting but will

1058
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,609
it'll be at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of better</font>

1059
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:35,520
performance and you know routers route

1060
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:38,040
and forward bits first and<font color="#CCCCCC"> foremost so</font>

1061
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,810
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being a router vendor</font>

1062
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,950
it's easy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to say that that's an</font>

1063
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:45,270
easy answer for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I know firsthand</font>

1064
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,100
that router vendors are working very

1065
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:50,759
hard on finding ways to improve

1066
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,020
accounting in terms of you know sampling

1067
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,000
on routers for<font color="#E5E5E5"> net flow didn't those</font>

1068
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,009
exist once we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to higher speed</font>

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">interfaces you know how no c48 link</font>

1070
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,510
doing one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one packet analysis you</font>

1071
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,590
know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of CPU work no</font>

1072
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,410
matter what kind of asics you have

1073
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:07,710
installed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't generally work</font>

1074
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:09,690
and the goal here is to make the least

1075
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:12,030
intrusive<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network accounting you can</font>

1076
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:14,880
without so that you don't affect

1077
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,560
performance so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I get a lot</font>

1078
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,530
is well what's a valid sampling<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate</font>

1079
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,509
what what n can i install for one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and n</font>

1080
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,609
such that when i extrapolate out the

1081
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,410
numbers you know it represents 1 and n

1082
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:27,390
was like once a chi-squared analysis

1083
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,339
will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's a statistically valid</font>

1084
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:32,700
sampling right and i will give you a

1085
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,350
very easy answer I don't know the

1086
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,540
problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> study that was</font>

the back of the room doing other work

1090
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:51,240
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was done in 1995 1993</font>

1091
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,830
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> before there was</font>

seemingly somewhere around one and fifty

you know impacting the core router

1118
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:55,070
performance I interesting question of

1119
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,450
the cisco guys and apparently there are

1120
00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:00,780
some cards that have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> built-in</font>

1121
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:04,620
processing that can be costly or money

1122
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:09,060
but have this sort of fix into it all

1123
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:11,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I've yes I the cisco 12000 series</font>

1124
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,580
rather than 12 4 series routers

1125
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:16,380
specifically just between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chassis</font>

1126
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,360
and the fabrics from the line cards and

00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iOS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is and the like getting the</font>

1129
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:26,280
of difficult but you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and yeah</font>

1130
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,110
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> g srs have the engine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 cards</font>

some slightly different fashion we have

is basically that that you can you

your heart's content needless to say our

00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,230
current protocols don't work that way

1219
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,830
that was some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rationale behind</font>

mpls with me well it's i can define path

through and says that optimum network

average it's not peak it shouldn't be a

problem because he<font color="#CCCCCC"> can average just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

as the ratios are going to be consistent

1366

on the flow matrix it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be okay</font>

1367
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,330
this'll all work because the metrics

1368
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:44,259
that are optimal for average should be

1369

optimal for average plus fifty percent

1370
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,570
but we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on getting good</font>

1371
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,100
getting the peak data actually out of

go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing you can see every</font>

1378

1379
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,790
soon as that they function as a single

1380
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,819
backbone router for the purposes of the

1381
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:09,050
law of modeling again once things get

1382
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,400
refined a little bit we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1383
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:13,900
break<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out into two separate routers</font>

1384
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,900
and model that

1385
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:17,779
okay what we do once we have the

1386
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:21,499
aggregated daily summaries which is

1387
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:23,089
actually a much smaller file is we go

1388
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:24,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and post process it with script</font>

1389
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:26,299
that goes through and basically takes

1390
00:53:24,259 --> 00:53:28,279
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hops and correlates</font>

1391
00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:29,779
that to a data center so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1392
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:31,970
interested in again here since we're

1393
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:33,229
lunging the the flow data from data

1394
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:38,359
centers you want to know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much goes</font>

1395
00:53:33,229 --> 00:53:39,499
from santa clara 52 sterling one so what

1396
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:41,450
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do is we need to just take</font>

1397
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:44,390
that and combine the data for each of

1398
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,828
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp next ops currently what I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">insecurely we're not grow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up grow some</font>

1400

1401
00:53:47,509 --> 00:53:54,319
S&P technique to do so here's an example

1402
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:56,900
data set from middle of May sometime

1403
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:58,970
again this is one in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 I don't</font>

1404
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:02,150
remember when I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a daily</font>

1405
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:03,859
average for that and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just from</font>

1406
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:06,049
santa clara<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 data center to a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1407
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:09,529
the other data centers that we've got

1408
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:10,700
there again approximate data you can't

1409
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:11,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">put the anger lectures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this many</font>

bits<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our network at this point</font>

1411
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,019
because again if you even if you

1412
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:19,130
multiply it by 100 it doesn't quite

1413
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:20,718
quite work out precisely so we've done

1414
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,979
at this point we've got our data set we

1415
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:23,269
thought we know what our foes look like

1416
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:24,979
and we know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our network looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1417
00:54:23,269 --> 00:54:27,680
basically better know our luck network

1418
00:54:24,979 --> 00:54:29,450
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so we have our constituent</font>

1419
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,390
elements to actually start plugging into

1420
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:34,578
the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of building the model set</font>

1421
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:36,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">there there a couple of thoughts on this</font>

1422
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:39,109
one is to do it an offline way I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1423
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:40,489
sue in an online way we decided offline

1424
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,920
that's really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to go simply</font>

1425
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:46,579

optimize multiple times a day we really

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just modeled by grossing up the</font>

five giggling not to say you can't do

that what I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I took the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 39 67</font>

1467
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,500
network and I condensed it down I chose

1468
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:27,390
only the domestic network and aggregated

1469
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,680
the various data centers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the region</font>

1470
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:30,569
so all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Santa Clara data centers</font>

1471
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,210
break down into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single silicon valley</font>

1472
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:35,070
node in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the various plan circuits again</font>

1473
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:37,890
I took the did multiple LAN circuits and

1474
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:39,270
made them made them single circuits

1475
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:40,920
again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the purpose of the example</font>

1476

<font color="#E5E5E5">for this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today not necessarily for what</font>

1477
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,060
we're actually doing with the with the

00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">network we also took ten to man sets</font>

1479
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:51,029
because more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten demand slips don't</font>

1480
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:53,040
set up slides very well but they give

1481
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:54,180
the findings so hold for when we take

1482
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,190
this and we scale it up to the larger

1483
00:56:54,180 --> 00:57:03,720
amount of demand sets and large amount

1484
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:05,100
of notes yes again caveat example data I

1485
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:09,439
don't feel coming to mingle your

1486
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,440
presentations at this like well yes but

1487
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:14,329
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> our example network nationwide</font>

1488
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:16,339
backbone looks probably pretty typical

1489
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:21,019
for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience here when I have</font>

1490
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:22,489
faced the all the links<font color="#E5E5E5"> roc 48 and</font>

1491
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:25,419
another assumption is that we assume

1492
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:27,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">there no no no nodal constraints so</font>

1493
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,479
routers are sent to actually be able to

1494
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:32,380
do line rate and with most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like to be</font>

1495
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:34,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually 48 that's not really a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

1496
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,499
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> base demands that's what</font>

1497
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:37,848
we've gathered out of the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after</font>

1498
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:41,660
we finished going through and munching

1499
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:44,089
that data we've got you can it's all

1500
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:48,288
it's all fairly very evident very

1501
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:49,460
evident there the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter except</font>

1502
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:51,559
that we're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have to pull</font>

1503
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,599
in our background its base on<font color="#E5E5E5"> raffle</font>

1504
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:57,710
really based on tweaked round trip<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

1505
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:59,390
so the the base for the data you measure

1506
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:01,489
round-trip time between the nodes and

1507
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:04,190
over the course<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time that metrics</font>

1508
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:06,079
about tweaked a little bit as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the need</font>

1509
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:08,809
for physics distance of a traffic

1510
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,249
engineering has arisen but they're

1511
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:13,130
roughly consistent with round trip time

1512
00:58:10,249 --> 00:58:14,299
currently if you look under the current

1513
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,650
loads the network is nicely over

1514
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:16,819
precision so there's plenty of load

1515
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,229
there's not a there's not a problem

1516
00:58:16,819 --> 00:58:20,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently but what we're going to look</font>

1517
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:23,029
at is how much more loads we put in the

1518
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:25,700
network before any individual linkage

1519
00:58:23,029 --> 00:58:27,109
she paid you consent to allow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1524
00:58:35,089 --> 00:58:38,058
number you can set this number to

1525
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,190
anything you want seventy percent sixty

1526

1527
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:52,069
oh we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to polish the second why</font>

1528
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:54,410
they switch the tape right back up so it

1529
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:56,630
just to just to recap we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

1530
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:58,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">and see how much we can put the links we</font>

00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:00,380
had a charity percent utilization for

1532
00:58:58,249 --> 00:59:02,149
Nessie 48 back figures out to 1990

1533
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,430
megabits per second then I try to keep

1534
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:08,450
all the links doing that so when we

1535
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:09,919
linearly increase this this is the this

1536
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:11,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">is our set of sort of paps under the</font>

self-explanatory there

1540
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:21,859
the when we increase that those network

1541
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:25,038
load linearly you can see the base load

1542

three hot links and everything else is

1552

fairly lightly utilized and we can ink

so your your Argentine<font color="#E5E5E5"> States pretty</font>

1710

more again it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to depend on your</font>

1711
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:47,439
individual network as to what

1712
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:48,580
implications that have you could send

1713
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,869
something you know through London and

1714
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:51,040
back theoretically which is why you

1715
01:05:49,869 --> 01:05:52,270
don't at that point you start at seen

1716
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,950
results like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to implement</font>

1717
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:57,190
some sort of constraint function that

1718
01:05:53,950 --> 01:06:00,250
prevents that happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one last</font>

1719
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:01,869
yeah sorta I bring this up because there

1720
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:05,950
is one provider in the United States

1721

actually apply the terminal Network so

be very theoretical and very

1783
01:08:57,988 --> 01:09:06,479
mathematical and it's a typical it took

1784
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:08,250
a month it took a but time I really sore

1785
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,139
dig into it took me about a month to sit

1786
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,460
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go through and really figure</font>

out enough to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working model</font>

1788
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,939
together that that's why it's a boils

01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:16,890
down to him helping me out tremendously

1790
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:18,509
of things like the syntax and I'm like

1791
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:19,710
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this I can't don't have</font>

1792
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:21,179
to specify this because when you're

1793
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:23,219
going through inducing linear

1794
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:25,259
programming you're basically if I

1795
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:26,339
translate the algebraic syntax intact

1796
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:27,448
like in the paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example to</font>

01:09:26,339 --> 01:09:28,738
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually the language</font>

understand you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to say i want</font>

1799
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:32,160
it to iterate over the following sets

1802
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,929
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly different than the</font>

problem and it

1812
01:09:56,250 --> 01:10:01,560
you go to the opal website in fact the

01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:03,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one down there they've got some</font>

01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,920
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see how that's</font>

1817
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,389
implemented in opal and then make the

01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,590
appropriate adjustments for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

1820
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:19,590
tools are free up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 variables or</font>

300 constants in the in the language

1822
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,620
which gives you enough to play start

1823
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,880
playing around them and developing your

1824

01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,900
also some free alternatives out there

1827
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:33,510
but I actually stuck with these because

1828
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,769
this is what the what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

1829
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:36,270
authors<font color="#CCCCCC"> to paper to use so I wanted to</font>

1830
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:37,920
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I had a language I do</font>

1831
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:39,840
like I represent what I've signed a

1832
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,570
model in how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go about</font>

1833
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressing the the validity or the sort</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the border parameter of the of the</font>

1835
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,389
modeling engine I mean how do you know

1836
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:52,800
the end modeling agent is accurate you

1837
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:55,350
mean as far as what sort of metrics that

1838
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,230
produces no well you you you define your

1839
01:10:55,350 --> 01:11:00,030
sort of routing problem where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

1840
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:02,040
through you say with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font>

1841
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:04,019
link that how things how<font color="#CCCCCC"> two things slow</font>

1842
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,370
so that's one model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you and</font>

1843
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,630
then you have another model where you

1844
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:09,240
actually go through and say okay I want

1845
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:12,270
you optimize my link set and you take

1846
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,530

1848
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,080
should things flow and then you can

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the links and go it's</font>

01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:23,160
take that you take the results in the

1852

second set plug them into the first set

1853

and have that and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it use the first</font>

1861
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:52,230
I mean that would result in more LSCs

1862
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:53,940
and wrote if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> too frequently you'd</font>

1863
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:55,650
have increasing stability because of

01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,690
that yes you're right but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

1865
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:59,250
something we do frequently this is

1866
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:01,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we would probably do in</font>

1867
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,940
the order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of about every well we tender</font>

1868
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,100
so that would be a significant change

1869
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,750
based on the flow data and cable

1870
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,640

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they actually make a change and</font>

1876
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:22,110
it's a reasonably minor change though

1877
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,180
you would probably expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1878
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:26,009
changes would go up as your as your link

01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:28,110

<font color="#E5E5E5">if once you start getting to the point</font>

1882

that's why you set the threshold for me

1883
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:33,330
like eighty percent and once you're

yourself some more overhead

anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right cool I think</font>

1894
01:12:57,769 --> 01:13:02,510
we're probably have a break next yeah we

1895

won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put anything else in before before</font>

come back we'll we'll have to listen to

joe from<font color="#CCCCCC"> masam global crossing talk</font>

you already well they say you're

01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:58,820

process I'm a network engineer not a CEO

1930
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:10,389
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good news supposedly is</font>

1931
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:15,070
that we have a completed network and and

1932
01:15:10,389 --> 01:15:18,650
going through the reorg process has

1933
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:23,509
caused us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> slash costs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dramatically</font>

1934
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:27,348
and made us leaner meaner from behind

1935
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:30,260
the lines I'd say that we that morale

1936
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:32,000
spurt is really good and that we're

1937
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:35,540
actually seeing customers turned up

of this there's a consolidation of

coordinator was able to settle this it

2132
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:08,660
actually turned out we were selling

2133
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:15,240
services to this particular peer so

2134
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:19,769
false alarm so where we look where we

2135
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:23,250
look and why first of all our design is

2136
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:26,490
hierarchical we have an edge now where I

2137
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:31,410
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a pretty picture but but we</font>

2138
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:35,190
have an edge and redundant core all the

2139
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:37,889
edge boxes run dual links up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

2140
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:40,790
redundant core and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a when</font>

2141
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:48,020
layer that the core routers have

01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:51,930
redundant links up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it's fairly from</font>

2143
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">it it's a very fairly common topology</font>

2144
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:56,850
nowadays our peers tend to be done

2145
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:58,740
dedicated fearing routers though there

2146
01:28:56,850 --> 01:29:02,370
are occasions where we have customers on

2147
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:05,010
peering routers and our appearing is

2148
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:11,099
consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fairly consistent and</font>

2149
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:15,930
very rich and as such because of this

2150
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:18,060
high arc hierarchy we we have to look

2151
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:21,680
here you have to go to the border router

2152
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:24,540
to collect slow statistics if it wasn't

2153
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:27,960
if we collected further into the network

2154
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:31,290
we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch traffic that was being</font>

2155
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:35,010

01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:37,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">same border router so it's a pretty</font>

2157
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:40,170
logical place for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collection flow</font>

2160
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:53,659
and it's a natural aggregation point for

2161
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:55,670
traffic so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to add so you</font>

2162
01:29:53,659 --> 01:29:58,549

01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:09,800

that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vtp import policy gets in the</font>

perhaps they're preferring your

very much of that and that's another

possibility for transiting traffic but

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're doing the the fact that</font>

that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be times where</font>

01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:28,730
always know for sure you're taking the

local route selection on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router and</font>

2230
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:36,110
so it can change sometimes but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt</font>

2231

rightly points out if you're collecting

2234
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,920
media like a map you know who's on the

01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:47,049
other edge of that link so you can

2236
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:47,050
always correct that that make sense

Oh was that any other question sure

where you have your purchase in places

like an app where you don't have that

01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:52,980
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will prevent us from</font>

2271
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:56,180
having to flop router configures back

2272
01:35:52,980 --> 01:36:01,769
the router configurations back and forth

2273
01:35:56,180 --> 01:36:05,220
also I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry something I guess the</font>

2274
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:08,910
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other point is that that the</font>

through<font color="#E5E5E5"> information for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every asn along</font>

2277
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:24,269
the na s path and so we can generalize

2278
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:29,820
the information for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular asn at</font>

2279
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:31,260
any point within an ass path and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

2280
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:34,469
that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something fairly</font>

2281
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:40,100
specific to XE<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if anyone</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">else who knows who knows so</font>

2283
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:51,800
so already putting we're going to put

2284
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:53,950
this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> kron and in the long term we're</font>

2285
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:58,400
looking to distribute collection a bit

2286
01:36:53,950 --> 01:37:00,710
having one collector is just not any we

2287
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,269
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> redundancy well I don't know if</font>

2288
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:06,700
every time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible i guess</font>

2289
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:12,170
this little collection looks that

<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing's impossible says Josh we're</font>

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribute collection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too you</font>

2292
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:18,830
know currently we have a central

2293
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:21,530
collector and we probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one in</font>

2294
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:25,880
Europe and one in Asia and a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

2295
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:28,759
the US or something to that effect don't

2296
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:32,360
build in some visualization because<font color="#CCCCCC"> VPS</font>

2297
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:37,490
like that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and so doesn't</font>

2298
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:41,179
so do not sow and integrate and that

2299

integration<font color="#CCCCCC"> allali involves rd tool or</font>

something to that effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> and really</font>

2301
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:50,650
hadn't looked at looked at that much in

I've lost my place in my notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> there we</font>

2304
01:37:58,019 --> 01:38:04,679
go for me this is a good exercise in

01:38:00,659 --> 01:38:07,409
that net flow 101 I've been not working

2307
01:38:07,409 --> 01:38:11,669
let other people think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind</font>

2308
01:38:09,389 --> 01:38:17,489
of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so for me it was a really</font>

2309
01:38:11,669 --> 01:38:20,789
good introduction to net flow and say

2310

and running to look for people breaking

2326
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:29,870
your agreements and then you didn't find

2329
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:36,830
as a spot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lessor to say hey the</font>

up fifty percent let's go police this

2332

link real quick with just a spot you I

2333
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:48,200
mean if that's your primary use of this

2334
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:49,850
data then it sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it exploded for</font>

01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:53,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">if the fact that you didn't find</font>

2336
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:57,590
anything actually I'm you know really

2337
01:39:53,090 --> 01:40:00,530
need to expound on that we'd like to be

2338
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:02,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">proactive we'd like it to discover when</font>

2339
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:05,599
when it's happening right<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it's</font>

2340
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:08,840
happening so we can turn to the turn to

2341
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:11,210
the perpetrator or I had a slide in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

2342
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:16,550
at one time that suggested perhaps their

2343
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:21,040
routing policy was woefully awry but you

2344
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:21,040
know inform them of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the accident but</font>

2345
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:30,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're collecting the data anyway and we</font>

2346
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:33,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">permit and if we're collecting the data</font>

2347
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:38,090
we can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a number of possibles</font>

2348
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:39,910
this is just one application so we've

2349
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:42,410
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a commitment to collect the data</font>

2350
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:45,230
running a crimes out to check and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if</font>

2351
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:48,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are abusing peering at you know</font>

2352
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:52,370
that takes you know 30 seconds or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2353
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:54,139
know maybe three minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

2354
01:40:52,370 --> 01:40:56,090
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mountain point is that they're</font>

2355
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:57,770
primarily collecting and analyzing data

2356
01:40:56,090 --> 01:41:00,860
for traffic engineering purposes and

2357
01:40:57,770 --> 01:41:03,290
this was an interesting application that

2358
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:05,870
they put some of the data analysis to

2359
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:08,570
one of many applications but it's one we

2360
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:11,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked them to report on to do this group</font>

2361
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:12,650
but comparing policing is something that

2362
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:16,640
it could interest to a number of

2363
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:19,969
providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think it's my opinion and</font>

2364
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:23,550
it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion but that you know</font>

2365
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:25,230
as as it as back

2366
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:27,180
bones sale as people go into liquidation

2367
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:34,370
that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are going to get</font>

2368
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:37,200
desperate and if they try stuff you know

2369
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:42,480
we're tightening our belts and we need

2370
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find we need to we need to make sure</font>

2371
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're not paying for upgrading</font>

2372
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:51,030
interfaces that have only been slightly

2373
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:54,450
let's say someone's only only defaulting

2374
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:57,090
certain traffic to you and they did it

2375
01:41:54,450 --> 01:42:01,769
gradually you wouldn't notice it in that

2376
01:41:57,090 --> 01:42:03,840
case and what we'd rather do is you know

2377
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:11,840
just have something that you know froze

2378
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:13,770
up a red flag when it happened so I

2379
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,600
think it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that</font>

2380
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:18,060
it's impossible and that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of</font>

2381
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,320
paradigm to only go after problems that

2382
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,610
are real because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

2383
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:23,389
they're real or not until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

2384
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:25,679
measured and analyzed them right i mean

2385
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:28,350
global crossing had a real fear of this

2386
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:31,200
is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty broad scale you</font>

2387
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:33,300
know it's a negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> responses just as</font>

2388
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:35,370
valid as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive response to say hey</font>

2389
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:37,440
we can stop worrying about this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

2390
01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:38,760
it's no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's a big</font>

2391
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,379
concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us we don't have to worry</font>

2392
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,910
about integrating this currently

2393
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:44,340
interesting to our network into our

2394
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:45,590
priorities you know we're not happening

2395
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:47,460
they could take action to stop it

2396
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:49,440
finding out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not currently</font>

2397
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:51,780
happening and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt so no one's best</font>

2398
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:54,360
are happening is another problem solved

2399
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:57,230
right and and that rightly points out

2400
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:59,670
that you know we sort of you know

2401
01:42:57,230 --> 01:43:02,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">pigeon-holed him into talking about this</font>

2402
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:03,810
but us and told<font color="#E5E5E5"> him specifically that he</font>

2403
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:05,160
was not allowed to tell everyone all

2404
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:08,820
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great wonderful things with</font>

2405
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:11,040
mobile crossing does but but yeah I mean

2406
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:14,910
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I can do this was just the</font>

2407
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:19,320
thing that he had to do they made<font color="#CCCCCC"> me do</font>

2408
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:23,670

01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:30,720
come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> man i'll give this presentation</font>

2412
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:32,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">to size effective if she's out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here if</font>

she's out there watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you</font>

2414
01:43:32,389 --> 01:43:42,159
yes I'm unworthy um gosh darn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it no</font>

2415
01:43:40,099 --> 01:43:44,510
there was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to you know</font>

2416
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:47,148
the one thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want from this</font>

2417
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:48,919
presentation well you know do it do what

2418
01:43:47,149 --> 01:43:51,530
you will but the thing you shouldn't

2419
01:43:48,919 --> 01:43:54,169
walk away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this presentation saying</font>

2420
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:56,090
to yourself is well gee whiz it wasn't

01:43:54,169 --> 01:43:59,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening to global crossing so it won't</font>

2423
01:43:59,209 --> 01:44:07,369
next year you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's we may we do</font>

2424
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:09,769
a presentation here that says we're

2425
01:44:07,369 --> 01:44:13,188
we're checking we're watching we may

2426
01:44:09,769 --> 01:44:16,159
scare people and we may scare people

2427
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:19,719
into not defaulting to us but where do

2428
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:23,379
you think they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go you know</font>

2429
01:44:19,719 --> 01:44:23,380
any other questions

2430
01:44:26,190 --> 01:44:31,889
alrighty i took a handoff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> joe here</font>

2431
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:53,630
ok

2432
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:03,450
responsive

2433
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:25,849
hmm

2434
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:33,660
the truth

2435
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:55,480
what's Daniel<font color="#E5E5E5"> about nizzle there's only</font>

2436
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:57,580
one how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go oh that was</font>

2437
01:45:55,480 --> 01:46:06,820
like a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> he goes f5 oh wait no</font>

2438
01:45:57,580 --> 01:46:09,070
yeah everybody give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so the</font>

2439
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:10,870
last case study we have is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

2440
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:15,269
one nothing really complicated here at

2441
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:22,090
all the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> um from the beginning I</font>

2442
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:24,370
work at MFM the the background is this

2443
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:26,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piers has appear in</font>

2444
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:30,250
Europe and we have several points at

01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:32,200
which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer privateering leagues for</font>

01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:33,400
various reasons we are unable to

2447
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,750
provision the amount of carrying

2448
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,490
capacity between our networks in the

2449
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:38,440
three points of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the PPO that we would</font>

2450
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:39,910
like so we've got kind of marginal

2451
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:42,460
productivity if you add up all the

2452
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:43,780
traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we send to them and you add</font>

01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:45,280
up the total<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> circus then</font>

2454
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:46,719
we've got Headroom but because it's

2455
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,719
between circuits and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic's not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">after Penelope circuits or just increase</font>

2461
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:04,210
in port sizes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case the pier</font>

2462
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:05,710
has some infrastructural problems behind

their hearing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the things they</font>

2464
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:08,800
can't accommodate more traffic in the

2465
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:10,389
typical patient we're waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them to</font>

2466
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:13,090
disrupt wait parity or something like

2467
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:14,920
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the task really is to try and</font>

2468
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:16,150
mitigate what congestion we have try and

2469
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,860
make it as good as you possibly can

2470
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:22,769
given that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite possibly going to</font>

2471
01:47:17,860 --> 01:47:22,769
be bad to some degree whatever we do

2472
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:27,500
so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have in this may be</font>

01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:28,700
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> Worf more of sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">people see with peers is that there are</font>

content posted within our network and

01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:45,770
can cause sudden spikes towards this

2482

particular peer network will completely

2483
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:49,460
knock out when pairing late May

2484
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:52,040
congested to the point where just

2485

nothing nothing really works so the

2493
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:06,110
we like because if they send traffic

01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:07,310
diversity don't get paid so you know

2495
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:08,660
although that might actually fix the

2496
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:11,230
congestion it doesn't actually make

2497
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:11,230
anybody smile

2498
01:48:12,210 --> 01:48:17,820
so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with we talked about in</font>

2499
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:19,560
Miami about some general principles they

2500
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:22,950
had to do the stuff and the general idea

2501
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:24,390
was that trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of a producer</font>

2502
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:25,620
solution to solve the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

2503
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:27,270
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go home and sort of have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea</font>

2504
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jealously but be happy that it</font>

2505
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:30,870
expects is never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen because</font>

2506
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:33,840
the traffic is dynamic and diverse and

2507
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:35,190
the problem changes the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so we</font>

2508
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:38,250
end up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this iterative approach we</font>

2509
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:39,570
basically measure things<font color="#CCCCCC"> your apply some</font>

2510
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,830
small tweaks to the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> from any</font>

2511
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:42,090
measure again and you keep cycling

2512
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:44,070
around that process and hopefully you

2513
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:47,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">head towards a situation that's better</font>

2514
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:49,110
than when you started so the place to

01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">start looking at that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say what do</font>

all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our own use but they</font>

MIT<font color="#CCCCCC"> g does looking at interface stats</font>

to try and reduce congestion all

2585
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:28,200
interfaces so obviously being able to

2586
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:30,480
measure interfaces is good so duck is

2587
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:32,309
something that a one of our msn

contribute traffic towards up here but

2605
01:52:06,030 --> 01:52:09,739
hopefully in a hierarchical model is

2606
01:52:07,499 --> 01:52:11,909
just a small number of backbone links

2607
01:52:09,739 --> 01:52:13,589
but for various reasons maybe the

2608
01:52:11,909 --> 01:52:15,989
topology has been compromised in some in

2609
01:52:13,590 --> 01:52:17,610
some places<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sales people and maybe</font>

yeah so on somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a number of</font>

not good to do that during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

01:52:37,349 --> 01:52:40,170
because people get upset so that's a

mate mundo can we found that<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the</font>

of animal measuring project there wasn't

2628
01:52:51,929 --> 01:52:55,409
actually exporting any flow data at all

2629
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:57,150
but we did have IP about cash flow

sampled enable an interface mainly

2631
01:52:57,150 --> 01:52:59,670
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never bothered to turn it</font>

anything it was sending traffic quite

2636
01:53:04,829 --> 01:53:08,130
happily but what happened was a couple

2637
01:53:06,449 --> 01:53:10,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of denial of service attacks using a big</font>

01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:14,848
ends up with sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially an awful</font>

2641
01:53:14,849 --> 01:53:18,690
the rather had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suddenly start dealing</font>

2642
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:20,400
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large amount of flow data it was</font>

2643
01:53:18,690 --> 01:53:22,978
doing version 5 exports it wasn't trying

2644
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:26,400
to do much summarization but it seems

2645
01:53:22,979 --> 01:53:27,929
that the the stupid on the GSR so it

2646
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,249
seems that the actual the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ram on the</font>

01:53:27,929 --> 01:53:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">line card that's being used to populate</font>

2648
01:53:29,249 --> 01:53:35,070
these flow tables was being being

2649
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:36,299
exercised heavily and it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

2650
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the code release we were using it</font>

2651
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:39,119
almost seemed like someone have made the

2652
01:53:37,739 --> 01:53:40,468
architectural decisions that you know if

2653
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:41,699
we run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of space for flows and we'll</font>

2654
01:53:40,469 --> 01:53:44,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">just borrow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some from the center table</font>

2655
01:53:41,699 --> 01:53:45,449
awesome like that so the basic result

2656
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:49,379
was that the route didn't seem to

2657
01:53:45,449 --> 01:53:51,360
perform very well in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact you know it</font>

2658
01:53:49,380 --> 01:53:53,719
basically died so just on those

2659
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:55,739
interfaces so just to let<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people is worth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioning any way we</font>

2663
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:02,430
in all places can be an issue and it is

2664
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:03,570
well worth testing these things in the

2665
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:05,040
lab with the traffic generator or

2666

something and finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the</font>

01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:09,450
results are for pathological flow sets

there's much much<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing the lab than</font>

random IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things and we</font>

2672
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:20,970
used one to a bundle of thousands as our

2673
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:22,589
flow sampling interval because we're

2674
01:54:20,970 --> 01:54:23,940
really not interested in accuracy of the

2675
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:26,490
absolute numbers we receive at all all

2676
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:28,410
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify as hopefully some</font>

01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:57,050

01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:10,070
later so we excited buckets instead

2693
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:12,110
which are matrices so the configured net

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is confirmed our suspicions of the</font>

2719

2728
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:25,770
convenient for preventing the traffic so

2729
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was kind of a kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a problem so</font>

2730
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:28,469
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we did was talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

01:57:30,449 --> 01:57:34,169
export on one's make sure we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a advertisement policy and we</font>

2736
01:57:36,810 --> 01:57:44,670
asked them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a few times in a variety</font>

2737
01:57:38,610 --> 01:57:45,660
of languages and and in the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

2738
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:47,460
seemed like we weren't a big priority

2739
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:48,930
for them in this particular issue there

2740
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:50,699
are other things going on that with more

2741
01:57:48,930 --> 01:57:51,870
deserving at their time and there's

2742
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:54,780
certainly not suggesting of there<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway</font>

2743
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:56,219
bad people but I'm it got us thinking

2744
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:57,389
because always nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do</font>

01:57:56,219 --> 01:58:00,750
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than the line</font>

did<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rant no longer at msn for quite</font>

2749
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:09,630

implementation written in perl which

2752
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:16,769
basically it allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject routes</font>

into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back burner so manually alter</font>

something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anything at all we</font>

2759

haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this thing already in there</font>

2760
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:33,780
for other reasons so what I did is I

2761
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:36,900
took the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first 12 and I generated 15</font>

2762
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:37,980
extra / sixteens to fill up you know all

2763
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one of these last six games</font>

2764
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:41,339
complain the net / 12 and pointed the

2765
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:43,379
next top addresses within the first 12

2766
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:45,270
that wasn't covered so the end result

2767
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:47,219
was we have certainly had 16 prefixes

2768
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:49,290
they were all pointing the same way as

2769
01:58:47,219 --> 01:58:50,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first 12 was advertised so this</font>

2770
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,990
gives us a bit more granularity without

2771
01:58:50,610 --> 01:58:54,330
the pier having to do anything

2772
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:55,500
so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag no export we don't remember</font>

2773
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:57,300
customers remember that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

2774
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:58,470
used within our network and in fact it

2775
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:59,700
doesn't actually modify the forwarding

2776
01:58:58,470 --> 01:59:01,890
policy all because they're all going the

2777
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:04,170
same place<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what this does it gives</font>

2778
01:59:01,890 --> 01:59:10,590
us 16 privileges in the rib with now we

2779
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:13,230
can classify traffic against so there's

2780
01:59:10,590 --> 01:59:14,820
the objective the better get better
