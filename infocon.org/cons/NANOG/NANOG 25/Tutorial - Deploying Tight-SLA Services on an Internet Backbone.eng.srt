00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
so this session is on deploying title

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,809
design and deployment good practices to

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,359
IP backbone so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is to be</font>

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,550
pragmatic and to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you the</font>

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,250
technologies that that you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> use so</font>

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">anticipa-- see which one is useful and</font>

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,560
how to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in which condition and</font>

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,410
to back up this analyzes<font color="#E5E5E5"> with validation</font>

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,170
results so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,750
operational guidelines and this is based

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,239
on deployment experience so the focus is

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,260
on the backbone design so what we will

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,269
see here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus to deployment so fifty</font>

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,519
percent of what I'm explaining is

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,250
already deployed and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> over-50 person</font>

is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victoria this time so X</font>

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,149
pragmatic the other view of the analyzes

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,730
is as below when you look at tightening

22
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,949
the essays<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an IP backbone I think</font>

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty personal attention is going</font>

24
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,250
to be driven on controlling optimizing

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,130
loss latency and jitter the 50 of the

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,590
person of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your focus will be on</font>

27
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:16,560
optimizing the convergence so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster</font>

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,020

that you would typically look at our

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,320
dishes te and this 50 e so in this

35
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,330
context of this session which is a

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,130
only over to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc surfboard so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

with the T and this 50 sections where

41
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,720
the focus is on this search and for the

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,330
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the technologies</font>

such the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp sub-second convergence and</font>

46
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:10,800
then all the technologies that allow you

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go one order faster in terms of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">out and once again here my focus in this</font>

50
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,350
shorter presentation will be on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISS</font>

51
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,350
sub-second convergence and the reasoning

52
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,079
with this choice is that what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

53
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,570
see is that they are technology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think are really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nice considered which</font>

is this surf and IFI sub-second

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,950
conversions while the MPLS based

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,750
technologies have a non-negligible

58
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,519
deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and so it's important</font>

59
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,040
for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones to understand on a</font>

60
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,040
case-by-case basis what is the network

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,769
that you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at and whether you</font>

62
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,690
meet the conditions that ensure that the

63
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,600
benefits those technologies will give

64
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:58,050
you a higher than the cost that they

65
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:01,950
will cause so if you want to add further

66
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,310
information on this this content we

67
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,540
produce a paper and computer network

68
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,810
engineering a multi-service IT backbone

69
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,780
to support Titus lays an idea also this

70
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,200
tutorial at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ripe for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one in January</font>

71
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pre-tax in April see you can</font>

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,799
get the full day tutorial at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL</font>

73
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,380
and basically this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> tutorial is only</font>

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,140
the visible part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I do inside</font>

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cisco which is to focus on helping the</font>

explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to configure the routers and</font>

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,890
especially to buy them up with

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,050
validation results to make sure that

81
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:45,369
the designing idea works but also that

82
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:47,290
the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so the other end of</font>

83
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,590
the Secession offer this representation

84
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,390
is in four steps we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an introduction</font>

85
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,940
on accelerators to<font color="#E5E5E5"> position what we're</font>

86
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,489
going to optimize<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we will</font>

87
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,740
review the sub second ITP convergence

88
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:03,160
and the backbone diffserv design and

89
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:06,010
then we will compute so once again it's

90
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,709
a very short summary of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one day</font>

91
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,840
tutorial so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SLA</font>

92
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,260
introduction is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very short</font>

93
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:18,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to skip quite a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

94
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:21,279
concepts so typically when a service

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,110
provider look at a class of service

96
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,450
design for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background we will</font>

97
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,890
consider two of three classes two or

98
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,960
three aggregate classes in the

99
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,669
background you'll have one that is

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,219
called the real time of the voice of IT

101
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,979
class where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have commitments in</font>

102
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,919
terms of throughput availability<font color="#E5E5E5"> laughs</font>

103
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">right delay and jitter typically you</font>

104
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,490
will have a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> class of service</font>

105
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:46,630
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the premium data or the</font>

106
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,310
business class which will certainly have

107
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,190
commitments in terms of throughput

108
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,430
availability<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not wait quite often if</font>

109
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,500
we have a commitment in terms of delay

110
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,510
and then you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the third</font>

111
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,400
aggregate class of service the best

112
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,010
effort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,250
class which will have commitment in

114
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,229
terms of throughput or availability

115
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,140
sometimes you might find commitments in

116
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:13,630
terms of loss right or delay but there

117
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,219
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much looser than the commitments</font>

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,550
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> given for the business of the</font>

119
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,530
voice of IP classes and so while this

120
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,039
presentation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being focused on the</font>

121
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,989
backbone the focus of the word that is

122
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,060
behind this is on looking at the end to

123
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:32,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">nsls and when you tackle this problem</font>

124
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,060
you you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sewin see that you soon</font>

125
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize that you need to dig up all the</font>

126
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,289
problem in two steps you analyze the

127
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,780
problem in a backbone and you analyze a

128
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:42,969
problem at the edge and so either you're

129
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,250
going to sell edge xls or backbone

130
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,140
oscillation or an to initialize but

131
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,240
technically you're going to divide the

132
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,159
problem into sub problems so this

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,680
session is on the backbone problem and

134
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,140
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested there is the same kind</font>

135
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of material for the HS well at the edge</font>

136
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,700
you would typically see in a deployment

137
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,070
much more classes of service than this

138
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,680
why because the congestion is going to

139
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:09,400
be higher so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to segment the</font>

140
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,700
bandwidth between more classes so I

141
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,719
expect that<font color="#CCCCCC"> son I can skip the</font>

142
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,610
definition of the throughput

143
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,940
availability last word and delayed a

144
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,760
kind of intuitive and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to only</font>

145
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,650
overview three ex-la metrics the first

146
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,750
one is the one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turret which is</font>

147
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,870
generally computed as a variation of the

148
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,919

still when people design IP network

that's often a rule that they follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">reason that this performance metric is</font>

226
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,449
important is that because if you have

228

231
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,530
you will see that the grid put is going

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,719
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a degraded it is going to degrade</font>

233
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,990
if you have a development application

234
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,630
you will see that here the reordering

235
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,060
rate will equate to a lost weight so it

236
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:25,120
will increase the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> grade perceived</font>

237
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,489
by this application and then the effect

238
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,240
of reordering on voice over IP is

239
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,700
actually quite different in that the

240
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,760

and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the curse in this case</font>

perception will be unavailability so

292
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,350
it's quite tight but if you would look

293
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,450
at 99 that 999 person availability

294
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,190
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> between two points we</font>

295
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,320
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it equals to nine hundred</font>

296
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,230

300
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,310
one in failure so you see the impact of

301
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,770
this performance metric so you want to

302
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:21,699
optimize it if you care about tightening

303
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:26,130
your essays so that's a quick overview

304
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:29,079
of the SLA context in which this work is

308
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,360
optimize those SLE metrics

309
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:42,000
so in order to a control optimize the

that would be the game for you would get

331
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:37,800
with the Wonder tutorial so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

332
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,560
with the sub second ITP convergence so I

336
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,250
for an IP flow that starts on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net</font>

337
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,980
access router and that ends on an

338
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,770
average access rather excluding any

339
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,710
variation of BGP route so you have bgp

340
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,150
rods but you don't unlike the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flapping</font>

341
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,160
of those sprouts because it's something

so in strictly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ious is convergence</font>

355
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would get is on the order of</font>

356
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,720
like tens of seconds it's quite poor and

357
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,370
it explained by the fact that

358
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,040
historically people have not

359
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:50,580
we have not really cared about

360
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:52,589
optimizing sls or convergence like this

361
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:57,450
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> will explain you is that if</font>

lab measurements that we have that I

369
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,930
configuration you will get the

370
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,750
convergence on the order of like eight

371
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,400
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you follow the suggested</font>

validate the convergence delay the

375
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:39,830
second so that's what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

376
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:44,220
see where this first part of the session

377
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:47,010
so first step is to quickly overview

378
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,529
what a link<font color="#CCCCCC"> state protocol is how I size</font>

379
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:53,189
work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to highlight the steps</font>

380
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,720
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to optimize so if you are</font>

381
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,760
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more details that's</font>

382
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,800
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we spend much more times</font>

383
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,020
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-day tutorial to explain in</font>

384
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,959
detail those basic steps so that you

385
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,670
understand what we need to attend eyes

386
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,698
so we take this example network and

387
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,890
we're going to sit on this note here

388
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,050
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route where we are and we're</font>

389
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:17,970
going to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this note is going</font>

390
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:19,889
to compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> the writing-table so the</font>

391
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,600
first text to computer writing table is

392
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,959
to build what is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shortest</font>

393
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,839
path tree the shortest path tree is the

394
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,390
set of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shortest path from this</font>

395
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,730
note<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all the other notes the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typical</font>

396
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,429
algorithm that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used to compute the</font>

397
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">shortest path</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tree is the extra so you</font>

398
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:41,670
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in as soon as new thing about</font>

399
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,260
optimizing convergence you will think

400
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,620
about optimizing this computation

401
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,320
because it's the base of the building of

402
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,229
writing table and so here you see that

403
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,909
if i take this topology this is the tree

404
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to compute thanks to the</font>

405
00:17:52,910 --> 00:18:01,130
extract<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if suddenly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emerged the</font>

406
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,490
flinch basically you need to recompute

407
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,290
the extra tool either the new updated

408
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,090
shortest path tree rooted additional and

409
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,580
you see that the two trees are different

410
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,199
so as soon as you have a change you need

411
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,809
to compute the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shortest path tree in</font>

412
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,400
order to compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> the writing-table so</font>

413
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,820
this will be one thing that we're going

414
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at in terms of optimization the</font>

415
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,950
fiddle step is that well you have the

416
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,530
shortest path tree which is the set of

417
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the farthest path from u to V of the</font>

418
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,940
notes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cure what</font>

419
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,520
you check is the routing table that is

420
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,530
expressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of prefixes so the</font>

421
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden step is to use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shortest path</font>

422
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,428
free to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually build the routing table</font>

423
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,160
which is called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Great Dividing</font>

424
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:45,020
information base and so logically that's

425
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,790
not the weight down in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> curb but</font>

426
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,120
logically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can picture it like this</font>

427
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:52,940
once you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three with raft leaves</font>

428
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,800
on this tree and the least represent the

429
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,770
IP prefixes that are locally connected

430
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,990
to those notes and so mostly you can

431
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,510
view that once we have the tree we're

432
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work this tree and every time</font>

433
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,950
we finally we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to insert it into</font>

434
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing table because it's the</font>

435
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,350
shortest path to get to this prefix and

436
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,780
so once again if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we care for fast</font>

437
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,600
convergence we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimize this</font>

438
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,980
process of building the routing table

439
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,320
the third percent that we're going to

440
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">also look at is that the right</font>

441
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,419
information there is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing table</font>

442
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,330
it's not the information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

443
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,850
actually used directly by the rather to

444
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,010
switch the packets the table that is

445
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to switch the package</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">reduced optimized version of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routing</font>

447
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,689
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is called the forwarding</font>

448
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,760
information base and so the rib is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

449
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,870
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by the data plane to</font>

450
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,000
switch packets the third is an optimized

451
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,669
the

452
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,080
edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the right information base so if</font>

453
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:57,330
you take a rather you will typically see

454
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,520
that at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iOS level of the control</font>

455
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,340
plane you will have the best routes per

456
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,129
protocol so our show IP bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> show I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

457
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,720
sighs database we will try to inject the

458
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,240
best path into the routing information

459
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,330
base and then once the routing

460
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,800
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> based is built it will be</font>

461
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,750
transformed into a forwarding

462
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,850
information based that is downloaded to

463
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,430
the line thoughts to ensure forwarding

464
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:23,550
and once again this that needs to be

465
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:27,800
optimized to if you care about fast

466
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:30,270
conversions so now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

467
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,629
described the context we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

468
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:36,629
work through a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of optimization to</font>

469
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:39,960
explain why we can achieve a faster

470
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:43,380
convergence with today technology the

471
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,950
first step<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> optimize the SPF</font>

472
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,590
computation so the first thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

473
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,900
human being would do is that if there is

474
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,720
a change in them in the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

475
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,120
doesn't impact the three you should not

476
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">be computed three you take the three</font>

477
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,709
that you computed before and you just

478
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,990
update the<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing-table with the change</font>

479
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,840
in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaks this is the first</font>

480
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,410
optimization it's called PRC partial R a

481
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,659
temptation so you have this network the

482
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,210
same as the one I showed before and you

483
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,610
see that in vast it's the links that

484
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:21,060
have not been used for the shortest path

485
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:23,000
tree rooted at a and in red we see the

486
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:28,679
links that firm the shortest path tree

487
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,620
if suddenly a learnt about an LSP that

488
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:35,310
tells<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is a new leaf</font>

enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not recompute the free and</font>

491
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,870
such a big game because the three

492
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,850
computation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is eliminated so you take</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> true that you computed it before you</font>

494
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,830
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> add the leaf and then you just see</font>

495
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to add this within the</font>

498
00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:02,200
the instrumental admission

ordination of the rabbit<font color="#CCCCCC"> has changed the</font>

second optimization incremental SPF so

516
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:52,090
it's much matter because for example if

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,510
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I missed in this case where suddenly</font>

a learns that this link is occurred well

519
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:00,879
a with incremental SPF is small enough

520
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say well I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care because</font>

521
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,380
battling does not use for my shoulders

522
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">part 3 so underneath the graph is</font>

523
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,390
modified 93 is still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same so my</font>

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,439
writing table is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still the same and and</font>

525
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:16,750
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do nothing in this case another</font>

526
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,620
case where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a maximum line is</font>

527
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:24,220
that suddenly you add a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> router to</font>

528
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network in that church again most of</font>

529
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> true candy cat and the only</font>

530
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,220
operation you need to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to grab a</font>

531
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,560
new node on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tree so an incremental</font>

532
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">SPF will say well the tree is not</font>

533
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,879
affected all the routes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

534
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,980
connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tree will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not change</font>

535
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is to drop</font>

536
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,450
this new node compute the new outgoing

537
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:47,230
interface and next up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new node</font>

538
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:49,240
and then add the least the IP prefixes

539
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,890
that are locally advertised by this new

540
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,710
node

541
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,390
and so in this game we will have again a

542
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:58,410
maximum gain because it will go very

543
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:00,390
fast so the pet so how does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> work it's</font>

544
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,760
an optimization it's an algorithm an

545
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:05,700
algorithmic optimization to the Dijkstra

546
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,310
algorithm where you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> more information</font>

547
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,710
in the tree in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to fix</font>

548
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:15,090
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up instead of rebuilding it from</font>

549
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:16,950
scratch so<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the ice well all the</font>

550
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,949
ICS optimization that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

551
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe as be included</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bios personal</font>

552
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">qualities here at the back so if you</font>

553
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:30,750
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask any question is around and</font>

554
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:33,060
you'll be happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about this now</font>

555
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:37,080
the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost claimed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

556
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:39,240
have from incremental SPS its physical

557
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,090
because non-deterministic it depends

558
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,960
where the modification of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph of</font>

559
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:49,770
church so if this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree and i'm</font>

560
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,800
here if for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> i add a node you see</font>

561
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,200
that this change is very far<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from</font>

562
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,360
the root so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has takes a very small</font>

563
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,090
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tree so here you have</font>

564
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,280
maximum gain because incremental SPF

565
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,110
will really do the minimum required

566
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,620
compared to SPF which would result

567
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:11,040
everything if our<font color="#CCCCCC"> habit the change-up</font>

568
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:13,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">yours here so max closer to the roots</font>

569
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,450
then you see that the gain is small in

570
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,450
this case it would be more or less

571
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:22,170
visually see a fifty percent gain so it

572
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:25,980
depends are far away the change is from

573
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:28,260
you so in this internal project where we

574
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,540
do validation that's more or less one of

575
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:35,010
the step where we are so we're trying to

576
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:38,190
devise a good formal framework to

577
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:40,770
qualify the<font color="#CCCCCC"> genu hat so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i spit</font>

578
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:43,530
apologies and iterative of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what if</font>

579
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:47,920
scenarios to kind of compute what would

580
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:50,230
be the average again we see

581
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,690
have some early results from<font color="#CCCCCC"> esps but</font>

582
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:55,000
it's difficult to i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to quote</font>

583
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:58,360
them because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from a very</font>

584
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,400
formal deathbed but it looks like

585
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:08,590
interesting so if I summarize the first

586
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:11,530
optimization well if you detect that you

587
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:14,050
only have a change of IP prefix of leaf

588
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,899
information your graph is not affected

589
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:19,210
then the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> gems stay like it is and</font>

590
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,060
you only need to intrigue the routing

591
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:26,320
table with this league that has been

592
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,899
affected this is PRC in terms of impact

593
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,540
on the graph topological impact of the

594
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,940
grass there you have the normal scheme

595
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,760
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iterator way to deal with this which</font>

596
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,770
is SPS which<font color="#CCCCCC"> would recompute the world</font>

597
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,680
three and then we compute the world

598
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:44,770
writing table of usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> even this</font>

599
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">historical or all scheme did not scratch</font>

600
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,389
the routing table and rebuild it you

601
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,550
always do it in financially so you keep

602
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:53,230
your writing table add up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font>

603
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:55,180
where you know that this was you need to

604
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,190
remove it and replace it<font color="#E5E5E5"> by another one</font>

605
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:01,210
you don't delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then we computed</font>

606
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:03,640
it would be ceiling and the optimization

607
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,100
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scheme is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do incremental SPF</font>

608
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,800
so when you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your turbulence is</font>

609
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,750
affected you keep the part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the true</font>

610
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,940
that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> affected and you only fix</font>

611
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,040
the part that has been modified and you

612
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,960
only recompute the part of the routing

613
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:22,270
table that depends on this part of the

614
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:24,700
tree the second set of things we're

615
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,820
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at to optimize convergence</font>

616
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:30,610
on the topology and need optimization so

617
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,399
here it's more design rules that you can

618
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:36,669
apply to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help the conversions of your</font>

619
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,770
network the first one is actually we

620
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:42,100
don't need to think about it ice ice is

621
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:44,500
doing it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in iOS so when you</font>

622
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,230
have parallel adjacencies between two

623
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,540
nodes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias will only advertise a</font>

624
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:53,500
single adjacency so it's an optimization

625
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:57,020
that we put in the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could find out</font>

626
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:59,780
when but it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time ago</font>

627
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,030
and so it's good because your graph is

628
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,220
going to have less links so the

629
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:07,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">contagion will be faster and your</font>

630
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:10,190
property is now stable because if one of

631
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,490
the links visitors well it will not

632
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,980
cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> any new LSP flooding because you</font>

633
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,070
still have another link adjacency that

634
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,620
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a parallel and that they still there</font>

635
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:24,830
so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first optimization the</font>

636
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,050
second optimization is to treat the

637
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:29,419
point-to-point gig interface that you

638
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:31,280
often have in the top when you have two

639
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:36,590
ladders interconnected by back-to-back

640
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:39,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggie is is bodiford treat such a case</font>

641
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,629
as a multi access network and so in the

642
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:45,080
database is going to represent this as

643
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:47,960
two nodes interconnected by<font color="#E5E5E5"> footnote</font>

644
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,870
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> acute a note and this is very an</font>

645
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,020
optimal because it introduced one extra

646
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:56,989
node and one extra link so the advice

647
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,450
the suggestion is to when you have when

648
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> such a back-to-back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> degrees is</font>

649
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:05,570
to configure those back-to-back assists

650
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:08,570
with this at engages in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ifis network</font>

651
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:10,370
point2 points which will tell us is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

652
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:14,000

653
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:16,580
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two rollers so just model this into</font>

654
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,250
your database just like a post link and

655
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,250
so in the database it will be modeled as

656
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,860
two nodes interconnected by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link the</font>

657
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,380
difference is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we save one node and</font>

658
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:33,189
one link so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I presently they SAT</font>

659
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:35,630
right in January the<font color="#CCCCCC"> european xperia is</font>

660
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:38,450
deploying that is about to be playing

661
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:41,240
this time during the break and Tony well

662
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:44,060
by doing this chris says 300 notes so

663
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,240
that 300 back-to-back ddh in the network

664
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:50,870
it's a safe of 300 nodes so it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

665
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,320
easy thing to do which can have a big

666
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,320
impact

667
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:05,750
the third thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you might think of</font>

668
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:10,879
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to minimize the number of leads you</font>

669
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:13,400
have in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP the optimum the only</font>

670
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,340
minimum thing you need to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry</font>

671
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP next up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the other interfaces</font>

672
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,949
you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have them in is is the</font>

673
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,190
only thing you really need other bgp

674
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:27,140
next one and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be the</font>

675
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:30,020
optimum if you want to implement this

676
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,060
you can use rudder is is advertised

677
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,370
passive only it will only have

678
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertised the move back into the ISS</font>

679
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:40,310
topology and so you would choose I<font color="#CCCCCC"> btp</font>

680
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:42,920
to carry all the addresses of the top

681
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:46,669
via the interfaces that you have inside

682
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:49,400
your network the gain you have is that

683
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:51,830
it is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rod the</font>

684
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:56,540
writing-table construction and so it

685
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:58,790
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful for bgp because bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relax</font>

686
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:02,540
you have this isolation between external

687
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:05,480
routes and enter your routes and so bgp

688
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:07,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">wickers on the next stop and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

689
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,850
a very fast convergence of your next

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:13,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop bgp benefits from it because it</font>

691
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">serves back on it and if you make you is</font>

692
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,830
is suppose you too big it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

693
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:21,050
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> left fast and so we're in fact</font>

694
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">widget in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time so really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case you don't need to carry the</font>

696
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:29,600
interfaces address in is is so it's one

697
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:32,870
thing to consider when you want to

698
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:37,560
optimize for fast conversions

699
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:39,989
the next set of things we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

700
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at to optimize for fast convergence</font>

701
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:46,260
is the tuning of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timers that control</font>

702
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,890
the most important operation of ISAs

703
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:52,530
which is to run XPS to run PRC so to run

704
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:55,620
this algorithm that allows to update<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

705
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:59,340
routing table and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timers that</font>

706
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:02,219
control our<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast the router is going to</font>

707
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:05,070
rebuild mlsp when an adolescent she has

708
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:12,830
changed locally or prefix has changed

709
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:16,500
locally so the purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is to fold</font>

710
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:19,500
you want to ask this timer step with the

711
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">network is stable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you convert very fast</font>

712
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,050
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> act very fast to the events</font>

713
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,320
however internet word becomes unstable

714
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:30,840
we want to avoid a collapse and so you

715
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,730
want to slow down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reaction to the</font>

716
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:38,070
events so the purpose of the timer's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

717
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:40,980
going to explain here is to achieve this

00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,649
mess of birth words very fast behavior

719
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,600
in stable terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times and slow</font>

720
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:50,510
behavior if the network becomes unstable

721
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,418
well the type of timer that we use to

722
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:56,510
achieve this behavior is called back of

723
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:59,090
exponential timers so it's a timer that

724
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:02,600
is going to be dynamic that I'm going to

725
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:04,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">adapt itself under on the basis of the</font>

726
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,469
stability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the network this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adaptation</font>

727
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:11,630
is based on three values the initial

728
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">weight or the if you want the smallest</font>

729
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,850

730
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:20,780

733
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,260
longest duration that you will apply

734
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,168
when you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network is</font>

735
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:32,510
unstable and then between<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very fast</font>

736
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:35,690
behavior and this varied flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior</font>

737
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:38,900
the threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> terminator is the exponential</font>

738
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:41,720
seat this will determine our fast you

739
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:47,510
back off your education to go to the

740
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:51,080
very slow behavior so let's take an

741
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:54,379
example to show how it works so this

742
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,780
comments with these diners in iOS four

743
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,809
since quite a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

744
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,899
really used because they are quite

745
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:05,240
non-intuitive and that's due to backward

746
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:08,510
compatibility reasons so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to</font>

747
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:12,020
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easier than what it</font>

748
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:14,419
looks like that the first value is the

749
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,369
maximum value and it's the first value

750
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:19,009
for backward compatibility reasons it

751
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:21,530
explains it is expressed in seconds so

752
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:24,710
that's the maximum value that you will

753
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,690
take between<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPF education the one in</font>

754
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle and the last one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I expressed</font>

755
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:34,460
in milliseconds this where is this where

756
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:37,159
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the optimization of these timers so</font>

757
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,260
the middle one in the initial weight the

758
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,409
small exploration you will wait it's

759
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:45,200
here 100 Michigan in this example and

760
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:47,840
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the exponential seat</font>

761
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,699
which determines our fast new girl from

762
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,740
the snow behavior of the default

763
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:55,100
behavior to the slow behavior

764
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:57,799
and here it's one second so let's take

765
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,890
an example where for example at this

766
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,590
time you receive an event which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

767
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:06,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">nxp that tells you that an efficiency as</font>

768
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,960
long as we suffered so it tells you you

769
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,330
need to executive PS to rebuild<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

770
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing table actually to upgrade your</font>

771
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:17,360
routing table so if you receive this

772
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,400
event this normal st at this time let's

773
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,100
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that time you are in</font>

774
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,930
stable behavior so the runner is going

775
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,420
to serve I'm instead of behavior

776
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,970
something has changed I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

777
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,880

779
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:37,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to schedule my SPF executive education</font>

780
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:42,560
in 100 milliseconds which is the initial

781
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:44,119
weight and so 103 seconds after we faq

782
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,960
the spear and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have read your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> writing</font>

783
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:51,650

784
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:54,350

785
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:57,140
the valley is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to say well I</font>

786
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,750
just exhibited an SPF and I still

787
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,879
receive events to ask me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> objec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

788
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spear so it moves the not the</font>

789
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,180
network is becoming unstable so I start

790
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,340
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exponential back-off and so at</font>

791
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:14,690
this time you're going to say I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

792
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to schedule the next XPS in one time the</font>

793
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:21,350
feet after the occurrence of the last

794
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:24,500
SPF so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the seed and so the Nexus</font>

795
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:27,799
PF will be executive<font color="#CCCCCC"> one seconds after</font>

796
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:31,010
the last occurrence of SPF obviously

797
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,640
based in the meantime you received<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

798
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:40,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">over even so over LSPs you will process</font>

799
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:43,129
all these LSPs at the next SPF here so

800
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,500
if after the second it XPS you still

801
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:48,740
receive an NXT with exchange in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

802
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,470
topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net the rider is going to</font>

803
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:55,009
see indeed the network the network looks

804
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:56,740
like less stable and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I keep on doing</font>

805
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,690
the back of behavior

806
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:02,080
this time I'm going to schedule the

807
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:04,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nexus PS in two times proceed and then</font>

808
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,610
it will be four times the sleep and then

809
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:09,610
eight times the seat so in this case it

810
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:12,010
will be in two seconds and then if you

811
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:14,830
have other events the<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture in the</font>

812
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:17,260
meantime over nsp that arrive you will

813
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:21,160
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will process them all at the</font>

814
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:24,100
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurrence of the SPF so unexplored</font>

815
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">extinct goes on you will go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full time</font>

816
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:30,430
besieged an 800-seat and so on up to a

817
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:35,500
maximum value which is in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

818
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:38,230
seconds now you see how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have if you</font>

819
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,150
are in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> stable behavior which is the</font>

820
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,520
parameter that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> always be used</font>

821
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,290
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that matters if your</font>

822
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,240
network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> tabled will receive an LSP</font>

823
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,610
that tells you something as change the

824
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,979
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> will wait this middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Terminator</font>

825
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:53,170
before jacketing SPF and updating the

826
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,380
routing table if the network becomes

827
00:37:53,170 --> 00:38:00,100
unstable equipped the fast behavior and

828
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">it slow downs education in order to save</font>

829
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:05,170
cpu and to avoid a collapse and so it

830
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,710
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worst case ten seconds in</font>

831
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:11,080
this example between SPF execution now

832
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:13,359
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is either you go back from</font>

833
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,960
an unstable behavior into a stable

834
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:20,049
behavior and this implementation does it

835
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,940
like this if the value sees the period

836
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:25,960
of time of two times the maximum value

837
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:30,010
so here 20 seconds without the reset of

838
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,920
any LSP it declares the network as being

839
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:35,530
stable again and so it sets the timer to

840
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial rate again and so the next</font>

841
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">LSP that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could be received will be</font>

842
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,000
processed 100 Michigan after in this

843
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,830
example

844
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,710
so you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the skin you can</font>

845
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:50,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">target very fast reaction fast</font>

846
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:55,090
convergence with that compliment without

847
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,720
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade off of stability the problem</font>

848
00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:01,540
with the Steiners was maybe the

849
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,980
explanation of them but also the

850
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,369
deferred values when they have been

851
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,560
introduced in iOS was the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did</font>

852
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:10,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did not take much risk and the</font>

853
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,480
different values are quite quite quite

854
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,790
slow so basically that's why that by

855
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,119
default even if you have those timers

856
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:21,820
you will have a quite slow convergence

857
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,890
they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really benefit of the</font>

864
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,240
table will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be five dot five seconds and</font>

865
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:44,619
this is not needed if your network is

866
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">there we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can process it right away so</font>

867
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:51,670
before giving you some suggestion on how

868
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:54,400
to 200 timers here is the reason why the

869
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,609
reason behind the suggestion we want to

870
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,310
optimize for the bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> news we want to</font>

871
00:39:57,609 --> 00:40:04,299
optimize for the love of not<font color="#CCCCCC"> agency and</font>

872
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:06,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">ind extra in this algorithm that is news</font>

873
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,280
to compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shortest path reduce the</font>

874
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:12,100
writing-table we will only consider it

875
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,780
an adjacency between two nodes if it is

876
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:19,180
recorded by<font color="#E5E5E5"> both ends so it means that</font>

877
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wait for the to LSPs</font>

878
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,220
coming from the two nodes that have lost

879
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:26,710
this link as soon as when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see one of</font>

880
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:29,740
the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> LSP that says that the adjacency</font>

881
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:32,500
has been lost we know that SPF will

882
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:34,899
exclude this link and so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

883
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,240
tune the thing to react faster the first

884
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,770
behavior we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

885
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:43,819
second one

886
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:46,160
so the suggestion that i give here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

887
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:48,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">tune the initial way to its minimum</font>

888
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,120
value which is one millisecond you

889
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:54,680
receive something you execute<font color="#E5E5E5"> SPS right</font>

890
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:56,900
away and it's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> chemicals if your</font>

891
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,569
network is unstable you will back off

892
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,400
exponentially to a snow behavior so you

893
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:03,470
can take the risk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very fast</font>

894
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,150
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your network is stable and</font>

895
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,950
that's what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen the deployed in</font>

896
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,860
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we look for for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

898
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,650
the average time between Alex please

899
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:19,450
it's quite quite knowledge so you can in

900
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:21,860
stable condition do this SPF right away

901
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:24,589
what would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the suggestion for this</font>

902
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,380
exponential sweep the suggestion is to

903
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:30,500
take the average time it takes for your

904
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:32,780
rather to compute<font color="#CCCCCC"> xpf so in the network</font>

905
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:37,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we were looking at here it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

906
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:40,010
milliseconds that SPX duration typically

907
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:42,820
was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this network so we back off by 50</font>

908
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:46,030
milliseconds where is the maximum rate

909
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:50,480
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you one in unstable</font>

910
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:54,170
behavior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add a cpu utilization of for</font>

911
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,360
example 1/10<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 person so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want that</font>

912
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,370
you're sleeping spend less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

913
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:01,400

914
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:04,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">stable so it means that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want your</font>

915
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,700
maximum weight to be ten times more or

916
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:10,609
less the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average hspf duration and so</font>

917
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:15,279
that would be a suggestion to set the

918
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:19,010
maximum weight time and so these timers

919
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,760
are available<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are going to control the</font>

920
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:25,880
FPS education the PRC education and also

00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the building of the local LSP one for</font>

923
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,730
if you're loosening with the neighbor

924
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,589
you need to rebuild your<font color="#E5E5E5"> love speed so</font>

this piece of the jigsaw that you're

937
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:13,640
on in a bit heated manner it will risk

have an m2 and consistent path between

writing-table there are two behaviors

949
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:47,328
that we look at here the first one is

950
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:49,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">called pacing pacing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will behavior</font>

951
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:52,099
where when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your neighbor</font>

952
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:56,509
you're going to paste the weight limit

953
00:43:52,099 --> 00:44:00,289
the speed at which can send you a speech

954
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:02,869
to him because historically what if you

955
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:05,420
if you spin LSPs too fast to him he

956
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:07,699
might get congested its input you might

957
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,609
get congested or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU is busy doing</font>

958
00:44:07,699 --> 00:44:13,309
something else and eventually this

959
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:15,109
adjacent rather would drop some air

960
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:17,749
speeds and it is very bad for

961
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:21,170
conversions because then you fall into

962
00:44:17,749 --> 00:44:23,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">loss protection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and recovery and this is</font>

963
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:26,719
really not optimized for speed so you

964
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,999
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to avoid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a mission another</font>

965
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak so that's why you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to place to</font>

966
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,808
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't burst too many</font>

recipes at your next up at your address

968
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:40,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">and rather hear the default</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> value in iOS</font>

969
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:43,059
is 33 milliseconds historically we know

970
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:43,059
it works quite

971
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:49,960
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level view</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's too long</font>

972
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">for maladies technology but I don't have</font>

973
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">any validation that results that I could</font>

974
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:59,920
use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> back up a reduction of this time</font>

975
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:03,570
so my suggestion is k by default 30 33

976
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,430
milliseconds it's anyway quite small and

977
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,290
we have experienced<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a good</font>

978
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">value to make sure that you don't have a</font>

979
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:14,800
loss of LSPs with your neighbors so this

980
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:17,589
one see the default the<font color="#E5E5E5"> harbor behavior</font>

981
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,380
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the trade-off</font>

982
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:23,680
between being selfish and not being

983
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:27,190
selfish so what do I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> here if my</font>

984
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,319
neighbor sent me an LSP that indicates

985
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,260
that there is a change in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> topology</font>

986
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:35,050
the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> should i be selfish and</font>

987
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:37,150
compute my local<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> table and then</font>

988
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:40,900
slide the silence LSP to the neighbors

989
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:43,510
or should I not be selfish and so flat

00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">VHP to my neighbors so that they can</font>

00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:50,170

992
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:52,540
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will compute my routing table if</font>

993
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you look at the spread of you will see</font>

994
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:58,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have placed with such scenarios</font>

where<font color="#E5E5E5"> birth or scheme are better I'll</font>

997
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:09,490
to flood first and computers PS past and

998
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:11,529
here I cannot give you too many details

999
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:14,589
because it's close to the implementation

1000
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:18,490
there is no need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain what is</font>

1001
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:20,620
proprietary but at least I level there

1002
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:23,169
was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of optimization when we did</font>

1003
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:26,380
the validation for this here to achieve

1004
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:29,800
this group trade-off between floodings

1005
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:32,620
first be furthering<font color="#E5E5E5"> SPF while still</font>

1006
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,810
having the safeguard that if we are in

1007
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,270
an unstable situation and we keep

1008
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:39,700
receiving a speech at a certain time we

1009
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:42,640
stop being too nice with the neighbors

1010
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:45,819
and we take the time to execute SPF and

1011
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,190
then continue with the study so there

1012
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:50,940
there was so quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimization</font>

1013
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,940
gone in the code

1014
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:00,260
we reach the last section on the

1015
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:03,680
optimization to increase the convergence

1016
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:06,710
of your background<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it is to review</font>

1017
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:11,029
the impact of your link protocol on to

1018
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:12,980
the convergence at the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three there</font>

1019
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:15,830
are two properties that you need to care

1020
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:19,340
about the first one is the link failure

1021
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:21,470
detection it's the fasted and the more

1022
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:24,890
reliable the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the failure</font>

1023
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:27,439
detection is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the better it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the other</font>

1024
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:30,770
property that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1025
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:34,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">dampening for flapping links that the</font>

1026
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:37,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> link goes down you want to</font>

1027
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:41,060
very fast detected and communicate it to

1028
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:44,270
your layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 our handler if the network</font>

1029
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:46,700
goes back up you need and want to make

1030
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that the link goes back up and it's</font>

1031
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:52,250
stable in up position if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes up down</font>

1032
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">up down up down you don't want to go to</font>

1033
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:56,390
the layer 3 with it so you want to

1034
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,670
dampen the slapping legs in down

1035
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,980
position if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shopping links</font>

1036
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:03,770
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the second property</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1037
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:07,730
is important when you look at a fast

1038
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:09,680
convergence design so that the first

1039
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:12,500
interface type that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1040
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:16,910
analyze and the most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font>

1041
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:20,570
poss so you'll see pass is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best link</font>

1042
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:23,359
protocol available if you care for fast

1043
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:26,510
conversion so if you are in design done

1044
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">for new network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used us if you do if you</font>

1045
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:33,080
care for fast convergence so first

1046
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:35,870
analyzers are fast the link failure can

1047
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:39,490
be detected what class<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excellence</font>

1048
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:42,380
because it relies on SONET and SDH link

1049
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:44,419
management protocol so in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1050
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,440
milliseconds depending on the five the

1051
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,140
distance between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weather and the</font>

1052
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:53,099
failure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will find you will detect</font>

1053
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:56,310
the link failure so you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1054
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:59,220
SONET SDH is going to very fast in a few

1055
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:01,790
milliseconds protect the failure so here

1056
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,709
in our relative design for an IP network

1057
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:06,450
we care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about our fast the</font>

1061
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,450
would guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that enough implementation</font>

1062
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:22,700
would have the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of timer you</font>

1063
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:26,279
will refine<font color="#E5E5E5"> three timers to control this</font>

1064
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:30,029
the post be late for the line timer<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1066
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:36,119
and so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinda for reacting to a</font>

1067
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:39,750
new line along the default<font color="#CCCCCC"> value for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this delay is an immediate action suit</font>

1069
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:46,260
zero the post be late for the path is

1070
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:49,500
the whole time before reacting to a new

1071
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:52,260
path<font color="#E5E5E5"> along action at level and the</font>

1072
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:57,329
default action in iOS is to not react to

1073
00:49:52,260 --> 00:50:00,540
it the third timer is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> talia delay</font>

1074
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:03,089
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all time between the ends of the</font>

1075
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,890
past with a whole time and the breakdown

1076
00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:08,160
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interface and so the</font>

1077
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:11,790
communication of this video to is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is by</font>

1078
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:15,450
default it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is two seconds so let's</font>

1079
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:18,089
analyze how you shoot a suggestion for

1080
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:20,520
the tuning of those diamonds dial delay

1081
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:22,470
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1082
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,319
different types of interfaces such

1083
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:28,618
generating iOS but for us it's not

1084
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful so the default value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is Prince</font>

1085
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:34,560
know so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you care for convergence one</font>

1086
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,660
suggestion is to configure it to eight

1087
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:40,500
milliseconds that's the result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1088
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:42,930
validation with it so egg<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michigan's for</font>

1089
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,839
the carrier delay as soon basically it

1090
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:48,810
means that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as you detect the</font>

1091
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">pass alarm you bringin facedown and you</font>

1092
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:54,549
tell it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> IAS</font>

1093
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:57,100
now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the delays food at now</font>

1094
00:50:54,550 --> 00:51:00,820
what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the delays at the summit or</font>

1095
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:03,370
mph drive the level between the notice

1096
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,460
the notice of a new alarm and actually

1097
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:09,430
it would be bringing at the interface to

1098
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:12,760
a down position so the opportunity

1099
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:15,190
timers day so it depends what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1100
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,550
infrastructure you have at layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 layer</font>

1101
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:21,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 if you are a clinic a protected SONET</font>

1102
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:24,220
Network then the suggestion is to allow

1103
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this protection to occur so you</font>

1104
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:30,220
would configure like a delay of 50 60

1105
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,290
milliseconds for the person a twig<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1106
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">line and path to allow the SONET Network</font>

1107
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:43,000
to protect for the failure if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use an</font>

1108
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:45,580
unprotected SONET Network then you as

1109
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,550
soon as you detect the alarm at either

1110
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:51,009
pass or line level you want to react as

1111
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:52,660
fast as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible at is is level because</font>

1112
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,640
you don't have anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offer from</font>

1113
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:58,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the SONET Network and so you should</font>

1114
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:01,180
configure the Steiners 20 so I think the

1115
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:02,589
line is in brain when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third value</font>

1116
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually the one you want to</font>

1117
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:08,800
configure so it means you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1118
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:10,600
do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this one if you are DWDM</font>

1119
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,900
between the rudders and you have a

1120
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:16,450
protected DWDM then the alarms you will

1121
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,030
see our only at line level so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

1122
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:20,890
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the path around and again</font>

1123
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:25,390
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have you want to allow for</font>

1124
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:27,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the deal w DN network to run its</font>

1125
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:32,210
protection scheme you will delay the

1126
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:35,420
reaction by 50 60 milliseconds

1127
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:38,330
and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you run it over an</font>

1128
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,520
unprotected Google UDN network again you

1129
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,770
want you want to react as fast as

1130
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible and visiting you see that here</font>

1131
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:47,480
the default timers are good for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1132
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:50,030
the only thing you need to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1133
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,250
reduce the carrier delay because here

1134
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:55,250
you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other two timers and its</font>

1135
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:58,250
really redundant so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tanger delay is</font>

1136
00:52:55,250 --> 00:53:00,260
not set to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero maybe if you do your own</font>

1137
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:02,210

1138
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,609
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your case but when we did the</font>

validation for for that part of the low

1140

router because it reacts to fastest on

1144
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:19,130
Ilan's and so fitting it to eight make a

1145
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:24,109
very stable behavior where we see no

1146
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:26,810
nose now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other so we showed it with</font>

1147
00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:29,598
plus we have a very fast link failure

1148
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:32,390
detection we saw a suggestion on how to

1149
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,030
tune the timers now let's analyze the

1150
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:38,240
bring up so when we clear an alarm and

1151
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:41,420
again cost is interesting here because

1152
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,259
by default pass and I think it's

1153
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:47,560
explosion in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard for sonet/sdh</font>

1154
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:50,780
we'll play it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

1155
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,820
actually I clearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the alarm so the</font>

1156
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,920
clearing of the alarm needs to become

1157
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:58,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">sent for 10 seconds this was actually</font>

1158
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:01,550
cooler the alarm and so it means that

1159
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:03,800
way this behavior you protect yourself

1160
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:06,500
with a pass interface for flapping

1161
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,109
behaviors that have a period less than

1162
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,540
10 seconds if the period of the flapping

1163
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:15,130
is longer than 10 seconds then then the

1164
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:19,700
skin will not help let's say it's a good

1165
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:23,540
behavior you have with us so pass is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1166
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:26,149
best link layer that you can use if you

1167
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,040
care for<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusions it will do it will</font>

1168
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:31,700
give you a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast link failure</font>

1169
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:34,369
detection really do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias</font>

1170
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,799
hellos if you ask person to face it will

1171
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:37,420
give you no benefit it will only call

1172
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,640
you

1173
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,920
because you make a network less stable

1174
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:46,450
for nothing so then don't you and then

1175
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:49,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">down and plus it's also nice for the way</font>

1176
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:52,750
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it will confirm that the link</font>

1177
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:56,950
is indeed is back up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds</font>

1178
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">before communicating it to is is what</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> over into first times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

1180

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes to nine a statement the</font>

1181
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:11,079
good news is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FE GG and 10gb in</font>

1182
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:14,230

1183
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:16,380
squirting on an extension of the link

1184
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:19,480
protocol for this kind of configuration

1185
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:22,660
where the preamble some bits in the

1186
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:25,780
preamble are we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a</font>

1187
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:27,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">link management protocol for internet</font>

1188
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,490
and basically the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1189
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:33,280
technology as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is used for Sonic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sdh</font>

1190
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:36,250
is being retrofitted into internet in

1191
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,480
back-to-back configuration in full

1192
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:43,869
duplex configuration so for our and

1193
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:47,530
where weary cloes to have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the big</font>

1194
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:49,240
interface so as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have this</font>

1195
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:51,880
kind of technology it means that the

1196
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:55,450
same kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fast convergence Europe</font>

1197
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:58,059
with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have it also with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GG based</font>

1198
00:55:55,450 --> 00:56:00,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">network in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meantime if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1199
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:03,460
older hardware or if you have ATM

1200
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,910
interface or all the type of interfaces

1201
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:09,369
then him with you will not have the same

1202
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:12,339
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of link failure detection and so</font>

1203
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:15,849
you will need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the speaker on</font>

1204
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:21,160
a tuning of the ice is ice hello and all

1205
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:23,170
time so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the fastest behavior</font>

1206
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:26,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can configure to run week with</font>

1207
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:29,589
iOS so it means that the whole time is

1208
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:32,440
once again so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst-case duration it</font>

1209
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:35,910
will take to detect a link failure the

1210
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:39,549
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an adjacency will be one second</font>

1211
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:40,129
we did because again lead customer for

1212
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:43,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font>

1213
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:47,150
design is man in class we did not do yet

1214
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:50,000
the validation for this fast ello

1215
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:51,710
configuration but then if you don't need

1216
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,500
to do it if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> passion to face</font>

1217
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:56,870
then do it because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that here</font>

1218
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:00,500
just for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example we had congestion on</font>

1219
00:56:56,870 --> 00:57:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">outputs and suddenly your hellos spend</font>

1220
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,450
100 milliseconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> and output and again</font>

1221
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:08,780
100<font color="#E5E5E5"> milliseconds on input on the other</font>

1222
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:10,939
neighbor it's 200 milliseconds let's say

1223
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:13,190
it's four times bigger and then you

1224
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,140
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose an adjacency due to the</font>

1225
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:18,590
congestion on your link well actually

1226
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:21,890
the adjacency still there so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1227
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:24,800
trade-off year with that you need to

1228
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:26,420
analyze in detail and so here I don't

1229
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,790
have any validation results for this

1230
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:32,960
consideration but I've seen it being

1231
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:36,110
deployed should I sell here so we were

1232
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,390
changing the tape for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video is there</font>

1233
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:41,060
any question at students in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clinton for</font>

1234
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:45,589
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time until you make sure until</font>

1235
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:47,090
the app status is confirmed sorry I

1236
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:49,640
don't know what is the status with this

1237
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:52,160
one I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an EFT but in the</font>

1238
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,560
context of the validation we did not get

1239
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,890
reach that level so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be the</font>

1240
00:57:54,560 --> 00:58:00,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">full solution to that problem now you</font>

1241
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:03,830
can look at the full day tutorial and if

1242
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,780
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to still go far outweighs the</font>

1243
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:08,420
design and you don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily</font>

1244
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:10,850
delay until you have an iOS where this

1245
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:14,450
feature you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see that there is a</font>

1246
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:17,600
suggestion to the way the LSP generation

1247
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:21,290
timer on how to a program the LSP

1248
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:25,009
generation timer to actually try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1249
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:27,080
around that problem I could not explain

1250
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,820
it here it will take me 15 minutes and

1251
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font>

1252
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be out of time that we read that</font>

1253
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:34,720
slides I think it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back here or</font>

1254
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,700
take a one day to<font color="#E5E5E5"> dial and it's a</font>

1255
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,649
workaround to try to have a China of

1256
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:46,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface happening thanks to the timer</font>

1257
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:52,890
but the full answer is this can I go can

1258
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:57,940
i restart yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's go on okay</font>

1259
00:58:52,890 --> 00:59:00,339
so the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next topic in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one day</font>

1260
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,380
tutorial is to other view a few

1261
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,390
guidelines on how to operate this design

1262
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:07,000
so it was a good idea from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> liquor</font>

1263
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:09,640
similar behind this this project which

1264
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,340
said when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do the validation please</font>

1265
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:14,230
ask your testing engineers to keep track

1266
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of all the good ideas they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

1267
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:18,670
operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then when we we go for</font>

1268
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:22,240
deployment we also remember what we

1269
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:24,850
learned in terms of good good operating

1270
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,640
practice so<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I skip the</font>

1271
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:30,370
world section because I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1272
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:34,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to slide not in this</font>

1273
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:37,060
pack but the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the web so let's try</font>

1274
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:39,610
to assume ur eyes what we learn in terms

1275
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:42,640
of suggestion for low level design for

1276
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:47,140
fast convergence plus is the best link

1277
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:48,819
type yes you have currently thanks to

1278
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:52,930
the link failure detection that you have

1279
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:55,540
from SONET and SDH unit 122 nyah sighs

1280
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:58,419
hellos if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask boss it will give you</font>

1281
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:59,860
no benefit you want to tune the

1282
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,230
different timers that the typical

1283
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:04,630
implementation will have to control our

1284
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:08,380

1338
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:37,799
and there it was a suggestion that's the

01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:40,680
one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the validation on how you</font>

1340
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:43,710
could pursue those timers the idea is

1341
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:46,799
thanks to those adapt with dynamic

1342
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:49,829
timers to have very fast behavior in

1343
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:52,288
stable network in a stable network and

1344
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:57,059
if the network becomes less stable to

1345
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:59,579
back off to a slow behavior so the

1346
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:03,480
validation results that back up the

1347
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:05,730
lower level design the first research

1348
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:10,440
that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain are quite old</font>

1349
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:14,999
we did them maybe in november december

1350
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:19,739
november with<font color="#CCCCCC"> no answer it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's back in</font>

1351
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:22,618
September so it was 12 / 19 s<font color="#CCCCCC"> kya delay</font>

1352
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:24,539
was configured to eight milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1353
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:27,269
all the time so here it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1354
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:30,089
two-second gain and what we analyzed in

1355
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:33,988
this first test result<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a difference</font>

1356
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:38,339
between tuning and not tuning the SPF

1357
01:03:33,989 --> 01:03:42,960
PRC an expedient timers this is the the

1358
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:45,900
lab we have for this validation we have

1359
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:49,440
a replica of the inner core we have two

1360
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:53,239
parts the top top and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part we</font>

1361
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:57,089
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> agents are three we use an iOS iOS</font>

1362
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:59,730
simulator to inject<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1200 nodes and four</font>

1363
01:03:57,089 --> 01:04:04,769
thousand three sixes into the is is

1364
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:07,829
topology so to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> big we use agent</font>

1365
01:04:04,769 --> 01:04:10,348
relatives to connect it to the access

1366
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:13,140
ladder in the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> part another one</font>

1367
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:15,829
connected in the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then in the</font>

1368
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:19,109
bottom pub so behind this access rather

1369
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:22,289
we send 10,000 packets per second from A

1370
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:25,558
to B 10,000 packets per second from B to

1371
01:04:22,289 --> 01:04:30,029
a this is the shortest path in normal

1372
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:31,550
situation and we sell this link so we

1373
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:34,400
fail this link and

1374
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:37,190
the packet path will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one after</font>

1375
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,590
the failure so what we measure is the

1376
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:42,470
number of packets will lose from the

1377
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:45,230
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we break the link until the package</font>

1378
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:49,490
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll add it on the new best path and</font>

1379
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:51,290
so the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of packets will lose x 0</font>

1380
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:54,169
that one milliseconds give us the

1381
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:55,759
convergence time and it's expert to do

1382
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:58,490
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this because it's a black dog</font>

1383
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,500
testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's not good to look at</font>

1384
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:02,419
our next time you spend in SPF it

1385
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,790
doesn't mean anything it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one part</font>

1386
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:07,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the convergence but you need to also</font>

1387
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:08,870
a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing table you need to</font>

1388
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,819
propagate this to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line guys you need</font>

1389
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:12,589
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> flood and so on so there are many</font>

1390
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:15,020
more things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to look at so</font>

1391
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:21,020
during this black box testing is more

1392
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:23,890
meaningful so we have the GP between all

1393
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:27,110
the access ladders and all we have

1394
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:30,680
144,000 bgp prefixes in the test but

1395
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:33,560
when we do the testing when we did this

1396
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">best discuss the average duration for</font>

1399
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:45,470
we always been<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times all the tests</font>

1400
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:48,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see the results are consistent so</font>

1401
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:51,799
it's quite consistent you see the big

1402
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">bars are the conversations time measured</font>

1403
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:57,470
for default I us so no tuning of the

01:05:54,980 --> 01:06:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">timers in this case the conversions is</font>

in five dot six seconds if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you assume</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timer's as suggested the the</font>

1407
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:08,810

milliseconds

1409
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:13,150
in the week<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly</font>

1410
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:15,420
the answer and projects related no me

01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:18,900
hace

1412
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:24,580
how could you could you reason we're

1413
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:26,230
just put it in the lab yeah you don't

1414
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:28,630
have the latency so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

1415
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:30,970
propagation latency which is a fixed

1416
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:34,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">value that we can add to those numbers</font>

1417
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:37,509
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you care about a link</font>

1418
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:40,660
failure in SFO that needs to be

1419
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:42,430
propagated to a rather in DC if you

1420
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:45,250
think that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> router in DC is going to</font>

1421
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:47,620
be the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is important to really</font>

1422
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:49,600
choose the new best path which is not

1423
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:52,000
likely it's likely to be closer to this

1424
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:54,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">but still it's only six thousand two</font>

1425
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,820
measures so it's 30 milliseconds so

1426
01:06:54,540 --> 01:07:00,070
propagation latency you can add 30

1427
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:03,700
milliseconds so now the question is and

1428
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:05,230
that's very important is yes 30 more

1429
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,850
seconds is the time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend on the</font>

1430
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:09,370
fibers can communicate this information

1431
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:11,799
but how much time being you lose at each

1432
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:14,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">app for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flooding and that's why I</font>

1433
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:16,240
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well it's very important to atomize</font>

1434
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:18,070
the code for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that behavior and so that's</font>

1435
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,169
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> optimize when</font>

1436
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:22,990
we started the testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the behavior was</font>

1437
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">not always the best one we wanted to</font>

1438
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:29,740
have so the optimization of the flooding

1439
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:32,290
is important because if you take 100

1440
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:34,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">michigan at each up to usps and then you</font>

1441
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:36,840
fled if you have 10 apps then you wait

1442
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,839
one second

1443
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:53,270
so your world in esta next test good

1444
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:53,270
question investors are plastic

1445
01:07:53,890 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm

1446
01:07:56,450 --> 01:08:02,399
ventilation we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> grow up love the</font>

1447
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,670
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye second for the flooding at</font>

1448
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,610
each other without the district at the

1449
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:15,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apostolic against me</font>

1450
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:19,080
I don't have a value but what is

1451
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:21,120
important is that I cannot tell you if

1452
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,130
it's too or eight or six or seven

1453
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,769
milliseconds but what is important is is

1454
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:28,290
that it is not 100 milliseconds of 500

1455
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:32,430
milliseconds it is not after<font color="#E5E5E5"> SPF that's</font>

1456
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:36,870
what is important I much time it's a

1457
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:40,410
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few milliseconds maybe less but I</font>

1458
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:44,130
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a number to give you a I have</font>

1459
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:47,099
a value for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 RSVP but it's a</font>

1460
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:49,020
bit the same but so it would be like

1461
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,730
five or six milliseconds so i would i

1462
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:53,280
would get that it's like a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1463
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes seconds but I don't have that</font>

1464
01:08:53,279 --> 01:09:01,950
data to sadies ok so this testing was

1465
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:05,129
with can you delay configure 28 minutes

1466
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:08,519
seconds so now this testing is to show

1467
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:10,500
that if you don't so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we</font>

1468
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:14,040
measured before so the average of the

1469
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:16,410
test iterations and this new config

1470
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:18,240
ukiah delay to its default value in the

1471
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:20,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">sentence that you review the link</font>

1472
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:24,080
failure you would measure to that 6

1473
01:09:20,609 --> 01:09:26,490
second of convergence so it means that

1474
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,859
really tuning the carrier delay which is

1475
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:33,050
simple it's only one line will get in

1476
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:33,049
two seconds of speed up

1477
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:38,380
can see we did not do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1478
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:40,960
thing that I learned when I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

1479
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:43,680
this level design the idol I did not

1480
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:48,040
know before the coyote existed in iOS so

1481
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:52,780
yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not know either so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

1482
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:56,230
test<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually one step further and</font>

1483
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:58,540
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at fast convergence it is</font>

1484
01:09:56,230 --> 01:10:01,299
not for the pleasure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking at fast</font>

1485
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:03,610
convergence as well the technology is

1486
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:07,720
interesting but to look at it first

1487
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:12,360
service the service that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is behind this</font>

1488
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:15,280
objective is most likely for surviving

1489
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:18,250
if it's voice of IT it's between

1490
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,920
gateways that are on net that are

1491
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:24,690
managed by the service provided and in

1492
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:26,830
the cages that I know it means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1493
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:28,900
destination the applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

1494
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:31,269
holes that we share<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information and</font>

1495
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:34,540
that care for the fast convergence I

1496
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:37,210
will fill your network and so when we

1497
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:38,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> balika singer photos</font>

1498
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:42,340
initially there for two advil to

1499
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,620
advertise it into a bgp and actually one

1500
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:47,710
of the result of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is that it's a</font>

1501
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:50,050
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to advertise with NIS is</font>

1502
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:54,010
actually to have the fastest conversions

1503
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:55,900
it's the obvious thing because bgp has a

1504
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:58,360
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complexity in terms of</font>

1505
01:10:55,900 --> 01:11:00,610
convergence because it recursion to the

1506
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:04,240
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is next up and so you need to update</font>

1507
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:07,960
it still you can have a very fast

1508
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:10,540
behavior if your network as load<font color="#CCCCCC"> balance</font>

1509
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:13,180
path between access ladder which is

1510
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:16,269
shown in this test so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to access</font>

1511
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:19,150
ladders and they are too or no but in

1512
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:22,060
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> 28</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will cross paths from this</font>

1513
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:26,889

01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:30,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">path are you see the yellow path and the</font>

1515
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:33,760
green path and so we're going to also

1516
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:36,400
measure conversions for traffic that is

1517
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:39,370
sent at 10,000 packets per second to a

1518
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:42,949
BGP route and will have three bgp box

1519
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:45,559
the GP one and bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3r</font>

1520
01:11:42,949 --> 01:11:47,719

1524
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:01,159

01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:05,030
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> measure the convergence for the</font>

1528
01:12:08,269 --> 01:12:16,820
Wizards we get with this testing in this

1529
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:21,860
case it's a reduced apology it's worth

1530
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:23,900
500 ISS not 1000<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is prefixes 80,000</font>

1531
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:26,690
DGP prefixes there was no<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason to</font>

1532
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:30,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the projects because this has</font>

1533
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:33,320
been done at different times in the past

1534
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:35,959
month the accuracy is clear 0 that what

1535
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,719
minute 0 that one millisecond and what

1536
01:12:35,959 --> 01:12:40,670
you see is the result of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 iteration of</font>

1537
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,889
the test so in bruges you have the

1538
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:46,869
efforts and in red you have the standard

1539
01:12:42,889 --> 01:12:50,360
deviation you see that in this test bed

1540
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:53,360
the is is the convergence the loss of

1541
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:55,429
connectivity for the is is next stop so

1542
01:12:53,360 --> 01:13:00,199
the move back of the excess water<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

01:12:55,429 --> 01:13:03,380
other pot the watch 300 milliseconds now

<font color="#CCCCCC">for bgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the loss of connectivity is</font>

1547
01:13:11,209 --> 01:13:15,709
by the link failure and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font>

1548
01:13:13,309 --> 01:13:18,050
what we are expecting no loss of

1549
01:13:15,709 --> 01:13:21,139
connectivity is actually what we see in

1550
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:23,449
the test<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the big question is what</font>

1551
01:13:21,139 --> 01:13:27,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen to the BGP route</font>

1552
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:29,719
that where r accursed<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the is is</font>

1553
01:13:27,019 --> 01:13:32,510
path that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be affected by the</font>

1554
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:35,059
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you see that it's only same</font>

1555
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:38,020
order of magnitude as the convergence of

1556
01:13:35,059 --> 01:13:41,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next stop which is</font>

1557
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:45,520
a very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> excitement and actually to</font>

1558
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:50,650
meet beyond expectations knowing how

1559
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:56,170
many so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sensations</font>

1560
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:58,690
they all 30,000 recurs<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

1561
01:13:56,170 --> 01:14:03,120
survey symmetric so 40,000 behind me and

1562
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:08,019
40,000 behind the other one but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

1563
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:10,449
it's a good behavior it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

1564
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:13,120
behavior i was surprised when we managed

1565
01:14:10,449 --> 01:14:16,659
to go to this behavior so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1566
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:18,460
an optimization it's not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> SCS code</font>

1567
01:14:16,659 --> 01:14:20,559
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you would like to test</font>

1568
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:25,840
it it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> EST code right now</font>

1569
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:28,179
whether in terms of design it's not that

1570
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,060
needed because the application that

1571
01:14:28,179 --> 01:14:33,070
cares for the fast convergence typically

1572
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:35,560
will be voice between gateways that are

1573
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:37,540
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> net and so the recommendation that is</font>

1574
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:42,100
in the design guide would be to place

1575
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">those routes into I esaias but that's a</font>

1576
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:49,260
place so the confusion answering

1577
01:14:49,820 --> 01:15:00,200
then it's not like this yeah but it's a

1578
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:02,269
technical it's a technical workshop so

1579
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:04,280
if you ask a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's I guess</font>

1580
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:08,170
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that the technology</font>

1581
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us is quite it's quite complex so</font>

1582
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:16,900
once again and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the tos</font>

1583
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:21,050
they can be lots of nasty questions but

1584
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:24,440
the word is never all all the goods but

1585
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:27,110
the art of<font color="#CCCCCC"> designing is to put yourself</font>

1586
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:29,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the good behavior and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

1587
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:31,969
for the realistic applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

1588
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:34,129
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sighs conversions is going to</font>

1589
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:37,580
meet your real needs you might have

1590
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:39,920
other needs and you we<font color="#CCCCCC"> always want to</font>

1591
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimize the technology we will continue</font>

1592
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:45,530
to do it but it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

1593
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:48,889
behavior so I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's a</font>

1594
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:50,960
technical answer to your question so the

1595
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:53,480
conclusion is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP IP convergence</font>

1596
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,450
needs to be optimized for Titus la

1597
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:59,030
services so I never used the word to us

1598
01:15:56,450 --> 01:16:01,370
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that work the word</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weather</font>

1599
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:05,120
so I use the word Titus away when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1600
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:07,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked with customers and that's often</font>

1601
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">forgotten that I GP convergence is a</font>

1602
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:13,660
performance metric that you need to care

1603
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:16,760
about if you want to tighten us relates

1604
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:18,830
we've done lots of developments to speed

1605
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:21,170
at convergence especially without

1606
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:24,470
stability compromise so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game</font>

1607
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:27,380
obviously the test results indicate that

1608
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:29,630
subsequent convergence is realistic so

1609
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:33,050
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not signing the contractor it in</font>

1610
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:35,660
very weird scenario you can sing<font color="#CCCCCC"> up we</font>

1611
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">will always make less than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a second but</font>

1612
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:41,360
fairly and frankly in the testing area

1613
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have been trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be realistic and</font>

1614
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,900
sometimes

1615
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,130
very demanding and we see that once

1616
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:53,940
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> subsequent convergence is</font>

1617
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:56,280
realistic the second target that we are

1618
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:59,639
sometimes asked by some customers it's

1619
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:01,710
the sub 100 milliseconds with the data

1620
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:04,280
high half at this time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not possible</font>

1621
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:07,230
with the current technology we have

1622
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:11,099
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to say that we can work on it</font>

1623
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:14,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we might wonder you get to it if you</font>

1624
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:16,770
want to get to that level of convergence

1625
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:19,980
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> today's technology you need to</font>

1626
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:22,590
change the the skin totally which is

1627
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:25,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice is as two fundamental</font>

1628
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:27,780
properties that provide this kind of

1629
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:32,430
convergence currently but maybe it will

1630
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:35,820
evolve may find very nice ideas to make

1631
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:38,430
it better<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the truth of things added</font>

1632
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:40,530
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed it relies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1634
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,099

1635
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:46,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate things to your neighbors</font>

1636
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:49,740
and this will take time and then it

1637
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:52,259
reacts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so if the link says you</font>

1638
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:54,929
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compute the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing-table and so</font>

1639
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:57,630
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to really comfort very fast</font>

1640
01:17:54,930 --> 01:18:00,000
you change those two properties and so

1641
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:02,910
you no longer ask your neighbors to help

1642
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,520
you first think and you no longer

1643
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:07,920
compute after the failure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> precompute</font>

1644
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,920
everything and this is what mpls class

1645
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,050
who God is doing so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that explain</font>

1646
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,450
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can achieve this with until I</font>

1647
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:18,690
start a lot now we will not go through

1648
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:21,000
that part of the tutorial I will explain

1649
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:23,190
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology is how to deploy it</font>

1650
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,700
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Detroit what I would try</font>

1651
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:29,549
to stress again it's a technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> my goal</font>

1652
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:31,740
is to be technical so we have it we just

1653
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:34,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">go ask this kind of technology but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1654
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:36,510
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that you need to really make</font>

1655
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,889
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to benefit for it because</font>

1656
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:40,590
the deployment goes when did

1657
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:44,840
non-negligible and so that's different

1658
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:44,840
from a marketing discussion

1659
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:52,490
but it's a nice technology maybe you are

1660
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:54,830
in this context<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you need it so the</font>

1661
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:57,469
other the role of the Turk is not on the

1662
01:18:54,830 --> 01:19:00,500
backbone this design so here we're going

1663
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:05,120
to look at optimizing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost latency</font>

1664
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:07,130
and Jeter so first skin on how to

1665
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,490
optimize website and see and jitter it's

1666
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:13,790
this with a single class which is the

1667
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:16,370
over provision it backbone so all of you

1668
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:18,260
run this earth with a single class some

1669
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:20,150
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would maybe have two classes and</font>

1670
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:21,920
I know at least one that has three

1671
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:24,879
classes on the backbone today which

1672
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:30,830
deployed what what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain</font>

1673
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:32,780
so the key idea behind dypsis and behind

1674
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:35,210
this serve with a single class which is

1675
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:37,340
the other provisioning model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1676
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:39,740
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> which will give you very</font>

1677
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:42,770
latency better jitter and rather drop

1678
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:46,280
right next again the purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

1679
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk is to be a pragmatic to be focused</font>

1680
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:52,969
on deployment not on the theory or

1681
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:56,150
academic study of schedulers and so on

1682
01:19:52,970 --> 01:20:00,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we'll try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be as simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible</font>

1683
01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:03,530
as as real it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is with respect to actual</font>

1684
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:05,750
deployments it's not as complex as what

1685
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:07,880
people think it is in the backbone and

1686
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:11,330
yes it's quite complex but not in the

1687
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:14,660
backbone so the other provisioning world

1688
01:20:11,330 --> 01:20:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this key principle is that normally what</font>

1689
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:20,000
people do is that when they reach an

1690
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:22,880
average mode on a length of a 50-person

1691
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,730
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> brave doing so I call it the</font>

1692
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:28,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">author over-provisioning factor 30 so</font>

1693
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:29,629
the idea where the other permanent

1694
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:33,019
background is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the old pee Factory</font>

1695
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:35,850
is at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are great at your age 50</font>

1696
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:38,700
persons modest

1697
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:40,410
I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this present this slide coming</font>

1698
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:44,010
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen customers from pack of</font>

1700
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:47,550

01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:50,880
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> there should be much more</font>

1702

one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those paper or presentation that</font>

1704
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:58,019
we can reference to actually show to

1705
01:20:55,890 --> 01:21:01,880
people that you can achieve excellent

1706
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:03,990
quality of sls with IP technology and

1707
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:06,570
otherwise you know if you sit on your

1708
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:08,790
network but nobody can reference it and

1709
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:12,660
so everybody think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need ATM to</font>

1710
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:15,690
do it so this slide report a testing

1711
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:20,280
that has been done on a Tier one isp in

1712
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:22,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. like maybe one year ago we're in</font>

1713
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:25,769
one week or one mega bits per second the

01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:36,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the jitter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for all those probe for one</font>

1717
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:39,000

1718
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:42,450
one week testing the worst case Peter

1719
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,720
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 700 microsecond so the other</font>

1720
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:47,910
provisioning model works great the

1721
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:49,650
simple idea that you need to put more

1722
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:52,470
bandwidth than what you need is

1723
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:55,740
basically a good principle it works and

1724
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:58,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use data like this to make sure</font>

1725
01:21:55,740 --> 01:22:01,740
that indeed it works and by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1726
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:04,410
you if you have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience in your</font>

1727
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:08,250
life to act<font color="#CCCCCC"> run an ATM network guess</font>

1728
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:11,370
what they use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule a lot so because</font>

1729
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:14,490
quite a lot of network adapter to be CBR

1730
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:17,430
enabled actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> euboea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and only managed</font>

1731
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:21,510
like this on another person another so

1732
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:25,740
it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same ideas I'll have it</font>

1733
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:29,250
although I said works well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1734
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:32,790
team has drawbacks why because it's very

1735
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:35,130
risky it's risky because if you miss the

1736
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:38,430
capacity planning and suddenly you have

1737
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:42,090
concession<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do not isolate traffic and</font>

1738
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:43,950
so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have congestion Sidonie you</font>

1739
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:46,200
will not treat

1740
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:49,380
also that you pack it better than your

1741
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:51,420
internet packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will maybe drop it</font>

1742
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,160
or will you will schedule it after the

1743
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet packet and tell me it's very</font>

1744
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:58,349
suboptimal which is in turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the</font>

1745
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:01,890
word I use for silly when I want to

1746
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:04,410
Depot Lance but to me its exceptional

1747
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:06,930
because you could do better<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1748
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:11,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology nowadays enables you to do</font>

1749
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">better why not doing better the second</font>

1750
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:17,820
drawback that I see with this model<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1751
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:20,550
that it can be expensive however<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1752
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:23,969
diffserv allows you to add the cheaper

1753
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that model but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more it will</font>

1754
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:29,220
imply a more complex capacity management

1755
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:31,620
so you will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the bits of design</font>

1756
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:34,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to explain comes in two</font>

1757
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:38,460
states an easy one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a more</font>

1758
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:40,500
complex one the easy one is focusing on

1759
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:43,560
removing the third sharing so bringing

1760
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:46,200
isolation between traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second</font>

1761
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:49,170
step in the design which is more complex

1762
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:50,910
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to have an economical benefit</font>

1763
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:53,490
by putting more traffic on the network

1764
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:58,559
but then you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the capacity</font>

1765
01:23:53,490 --> 01:24:01,080
management system so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it risky it</font>

1766
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">is risky because the target would be</font>

1767
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:06,600
factored<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have is two and two is</font>

1768
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:08,639
not a lot because a link failure are not

1769
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:11,190
failure and you can imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1770
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:14,880
the rewriting of traffic can absorb an

1771
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:17,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Okie factor of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two you can have</font>

1772
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:19,740
unexpected<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic demands you maybe</font>

1773
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:23,820
have not analyzed all the failure

1774
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:26,099
scenarios you may find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your</font>

1775
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:28,799
capacity planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme tells you that</font>

1776
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:31,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link but you cannot</font>

1777
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,500
do it for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason and then a</font>

1778
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:36,630
good example there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to show</font>

1779
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:39,060
this list is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can have a bath</font>

1780
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:40,410
attacked in run at your services that

1781
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:43,230
you support on the same infrastructure

1782
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:47,280
and then this was attacked on one

1783
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:50,799
service is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to affect the others</font>

1784
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,989
and so the issue with you have a

1785
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,969
burgeoning model simple one with good

1786
01:24:52,989 --> 01:24:57,549
stuff with a single class is the Fed

1787
01:24:54,969 --> 01:24:59,290
sharing if something that happened it

1788
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:02,409
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arctic whatever the package and you</font>

1789
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:05,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't try to to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

1790
01:25:02,409 --> 01:25:08,379
between the package and again I take

1791
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,810
another slide from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen castner and I</font>

1792
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:14,260
change the context in which i use that

1793
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:16,329
slide so taking video to add this

1794
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:19,900
correct explanation of the slide but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1795
01:25:16,329 --> 01:25:21,969
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another way so the result was</font>

1796
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:23,949
still quite good but what I try to

1797
01:25:21,969 --> 01:25:26,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">explain with this slide is that if</font>

1798
01:25:23,949 --> 01:25:29,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">something happens and you so knowing has</font>

1799
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:33,130
packets that have the worst behavior

1800
01:25:29,849 --> 01:25:34,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dips earth with a single class we</font>

1801
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:38,290
don't know what kind of packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1802
01:25:34,989 --> 01:25:40,480
here it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big lab the VPN of</font>

1803
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:42,519
the voice over IP packet and you have

1804
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,468
all your internet packet here which is

1805
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,210
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to do you would</font>

1806
01:25:44,469 --> 01:25:48,369
like to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> takes something</font>

1807
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:50,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happens the one you see here are</font>

1808
01:25:48,369 --> 01:25:52,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">your internet packet and if it's very</font>

1809
01:25:50,829 --> 01:25:56,159
very bad you want the deep in package to

1810
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,159
be there a question

1811
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:09,270
associated services

1812
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:11,370
so I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I reeled it in</font>

1813
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:13,560
another context I I should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken</font>

1814
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:15,870
another slide to be frank I should have

1815
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">taken out of the side I say if something</font>

1816
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:21,000
bad happens if you accidentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font>

1817
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:23,820
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not failure and you have no</font>

1818
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,430
traffic than what you have what what you

1819
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:28,769
were capacity planning for then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1820
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:31,950
might fool some variation in GTA latency

1821
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:34,500
drop rate and and so I'm just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1822
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:36,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">add a visualization for it and and what</font>

1823
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:38,310
I try to say that the packet that will

1824
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:41,760
have this effect you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know which</font>

1825
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:44,630
one it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you done it yes side</font>

1826
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:49,680
shirring they all share the same fate

1827
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:52,230
and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this earth helps you</font>

1828
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:54,570
with this because it is going to help

1829
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:56,759
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> freed the</font>

1830
01:26:54,570 --> 01:27:00,240
packet differently if one bad thing

1831
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:03,540
about using your network so it's it's

1832
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:05,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the service isolation if you combine</font>

1833
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:10,019
this with a change of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your capacity</font>

1834
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:14,040
planning system you can also have an

1835
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:15,690
economical benefit so explain each after

1836
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:19,170
the other and then finally I will

1837
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:21,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">conclude with the validation results to</font>

1838
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:23,940
to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explained</font>

1839
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> background is mature technology</font>

1840
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:28,349
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not complex and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> available in</font>

1841
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:30,510
the routers that you have on the market

1842
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:34,320
right now and that you have for quite a

1843
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:39,140
long time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might be delayed by five</font>

1844
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes so service isolation this is</font>

1846
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:49,140
on I think add more complex than what

1847
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:51,719
the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so simply it's a field</font>

1848
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:55,020
in the packet header that allows you to

1849
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:57,690
recognize what kind of data you have in

1850
01:27:55,020 --> 01:28:00,660
the payload and so you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to want</font>

1851
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:03,719
those packets with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dscp to say it's</font>

1854
01:28:05,170 --> 01:28:12,310
and that's it the bank the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1855
01:28:10,929 --> 01:28:14,620

1858
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:23,019

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet grade of service so we're going</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual team term is pure</font>

1864
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,459
behavior but you can say Q and queuing

1865
01:28:40,179 --> 01:28:47,199
scheme and it's the same so we recommend

<font color="#E5E5E5">you some with CP values in design aqi no</font>

1867
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:53,559

1868
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the recommended value because it's</font>

1869
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:59,020
much better to I think based on my

1870
01:28:56,830 --> 01:29:01,660
experience with this to only use the

1871
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:04,929
free first bit on the left the reason is

1872
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:08,199
that ethernet as only a 3-bit feel for

1873
01:29:04,929 --> 01:29:11,860
you hid<font color="#CCCCCC"> and pls as only a 3-bit field</font>

1874
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:13,870
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> suiciding so if you don't like mpls</font>

1875
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:15,699
unite like internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still have</font>

1876
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:19,239
the same problem you see that at a

1877
01:29:15,699 --> 01:29:22,540
certain time you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer</font>

01:29:19,239 --> 01:29:25,389
the to SIDS<font color="#E5E5E5"> compute net</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one pls to IP or</font>

1879
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:27,250
from IP to mpls<font color="#E5E5E5"> originate and if you use</font>

1880
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:30,400
six bits while you actually only need

1881
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:32,260
two or three that's an optimal because

1882
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make your life much more complex</font>

1883
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:37,870
when you'll have the problem so the

1884
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:39,790
fewer design try to only use three bits

1885
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:42,160
and actually I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never seen a design</font>

1886
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the backbone that fly to use more</font>

1887
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:46,239

1888
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:49,570
free which the full ones on the left

1889
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:55,570
that's all what you need to use

1890
01:29:49,570 --> 01:30:00,639
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a suggestion so that the</font>

if you reach that kind of value we

should upgrade the link for the business

or the premium data you located<font color="#CCCCCC"> into an</font>

nineteen percent of the remaining

1912

almost all the bandwidth that remains

after the teacher has been served and

then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet class of service you</font>

01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:12,699
of the bandwidth that is guaranteed

1920

the business will never<font color="#CCCCCC"> use all the</font>

01:31:18,969 --> 01:31:22,989
idol bandwidth and that's the scheme

1925
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:26,619
because if you have a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your</font>

this slide is to try to visualize the

example let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> take this point 10</font>

01:32:34,469 --> 01:32:38,939
personal voice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty five percent</font>

01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:41,879
of business on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> backbone it means</font>

1953
01:32:38,939 --> 01:32:45,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty five persons and an aggregate</font>

1954
01:32:41,879 --> 01:32:48,839

01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:56,429
capacity management on the process of

1958
01:32:54,149 --> 01:33:00,959
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis you see that you can add</font>

1959
01:32:56,429 --> 01:33:03,689
45 persons of internet on listening so

1960
01:33:00,959 --> 01:33:05,909
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> times more bandwidth in the Big</font>

1963
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:15,119
the economical benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> however that next</font>

1964
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:17,249
step is not the first step i would

1965
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:22,259
suggest it may be something that you can

1966
01:33:17,249 --> 01:33:24,478
plan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a future time why because here</font>

1967
01:33:22,259 --> 01:33:26,489
there is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complexity because</font>

1968
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:29,159
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change your cargo capacity</font>

planning from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an aggregate scheme to</font>

1970
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:34,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">upper-class team and this is going to</font>

1971
01:33:31,769 --> 01:33:37,079
introduce complexity however the first

1972
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:40,699
plane which is the isolation of traffic

1973
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:42,869
which is not complex this is not complex

1974
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:45,268
because that's typically the

1975
01:33:42,869 --> 01:33:47,369
configuration that has been deployed so

1976
01:33:45,269 --> 01:33:50,129
you have the template that explain what

1977
01:33:47,369 --> 01:33:52,739
what what I what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> explained it so it's</font>

1978
01:33:50,129 --> 01:33:53,790
a tan lines to say teach you ninety

percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and /</font>

1980
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:59,430
and then on a per interface basis you

1981
01:33:56,370 --> 01:34:02,519
apply the template on the interface this

1982
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:05,850

1987
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:18,780
but not in this suggested design we do

1991
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:29,340
complexity is to keep the current

capacity planning which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done on an</font>

01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:33,960
aggregated baseless so the only benefit

1994
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:37,080
you get is the isolation between traffic

1995
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then later on you can change the</font>

01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:42,090
capacity planning to do it on a class of

01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on your case it is justified</font>

2003
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:58,460
or not to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this second step</font>

2004

<font color="#CCCCCC">that for example forty percent of the</font>

2051
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:35,599
the jitter the teacher evaluation of the

2052
01:37:31,519 --> 01:37:39,229
delay so it's very complex and computed

2053
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:40,969
to monitor its in the lab and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rabbit</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">esta doesn't have this capability right</font>

2055
01:37:40,969 --> 01:37:45,859
now so what we do is a worst-case

2056
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:48,768
computation the worst cases you will

2057
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:51,739
have is equal to the maximum rate until

2058
01:37:48,769 --> 01:37:54,169
you have a measure minus the minimum

2059
01:37:51,739 --> 01:37:56,089
atoms you have ever measured and maybe

2060

we are even never see actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

2062
01:37:57,979 --> 01:38:04,879
see so you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here the minimum one</font>

2063
01:38:01,729 --> 01:38:07,249
is 20 micro second it's the minimum time

2064
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:09,919
it takes to go through a GSR so it's

2065
01:38:07,249 --> 01:38:12,469
it's always 20 micro<font color="#CCCCCC"> seconds it's a</font>

01:38:09,919 --> 01:38:15,259
fixed value to go through yard where the

2067
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:18,679
12,000 and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the maximum</font>

attention Ezard is 130 men microseconds

2069
01:38:18,679 --> 01:38:24,619
so it means that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst-case teacher</font>

01:40:54,870 --> 01:41:01,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">90</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and not 2070 so here again it's</font>

2123
01:40:58,290 --> 01:41:03,540
pessimistic I've sent birth traffic into

2128
01:41:11,130 --> 01:41:18,660
the two so I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten ten ninety 1585 2070</font>

2129

2131
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:27,570
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference between what to expect</font>

2132
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:29,760
and what you measure in a test case

2133
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:32,580
where you have burst traffic into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PQ</font>

2134
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:34,920
so it's very difficult for the rather to

2135
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:37,140
do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you always switch back</font>

2136
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:39,510
from the earth used to go to the peaches

<font color="#CCCCCC">and conservative voice over IP packets</font>

2138
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:45,150
and then it goes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tools</font>

countries through another way was in a

2141
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:51,840
schedule so it's a very difficult but

2142
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:54,780
text and you see that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blind meta to</font>

2143
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:57,060
AC is below zero that one person so that

01:41:54,780 --> 01:42:00,540
the bandwidth in activist is below zero

2145
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:02,760
different person what I do not sure

2146
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:05,730
because to me it's obvious but it's

2147
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,100
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked with this kind of natural</font>

2149
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:13,350
don't use any performance because it's

2150
01:42:10,230 --> 01:42:15,990
not well so if someone tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an</font>

2151
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:18,360
engine 0 will fail this<font color="#E5E5E5"> path or will</font>

2152
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:20,610
have an activation of one person and the

2153
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:23,280
CPU will be burning if you do this kind

2154
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:26,130
of testing I will say yes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> an engine</font>

0 is five years old then been designed

2156
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:33,300
it in 97 so I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this an engine</font>

2157
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:37,260
0 which is all technology compared to

2158
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:39,570
this but if you look at what I to me is

2159
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:42,120
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> non- engine two and then three</font>

configure to this slide it's a very

2174
01:43:28,559 --> 01:43:34,019
important ability that evaluate here I

2175
01:43:31,139 --> 01:43:36,150
said that when you do this earth or I

2176
01:43:34,019 --> 01:43:38,699
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do the other provisioning</font>

2177
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:40,679
model the principal you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use is that if</font>

2178
01:43:38,699 --> 01:43:44,119
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more bandwidth than what you</font>

2179
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:47,340
use you'll get no latency no teacher<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

2180
01:43:44,119 --> 01:43:49,739
you in so that the suggested design

2181
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:51,719
gives 90 person of the bandwidth to

2182
01:43:49,739 --> 01:43:54,119
other business to you so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is to</font>

2183
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">get more bandwidth than what whisk you</font>

2184
01:43:54,119 --> 01:43:59,460
is going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> why to give it nor it</font>

2185
01:43:57,030 --> 01:44:03,630
and see so that you can add a latency

2186
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:05,699
commitment to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> class of service so I</font>

2187
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:08,579
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to validate it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what I do</font>

2188
01:44:05,699 --> 01:44:11,190
here is that on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my link on the test my</font>

2189
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:13,679
line card and the test i sent voice over

2190
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:16,259
IP packet in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PQ again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> university</font>

2191
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:18,809
behavior to be in the worst case and

2192
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:21,599
then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> conscious my internet kill with</font>

2193
01:44:18,809 --> 01:44:23,909
two times<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than we've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the link</font>

2194
01:44:21,599 --> 01:44:26,369
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry so I've massive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confession and</font>

2195
01:44:23,909 --> 01:44:29,190
I had bursty traffic and then what I do

2196
01:44:26,369 --> 01:44:33,179
is I very the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lord in the business queue</font>

2197
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:34,919
and I tracked the maximum latency of the

2198
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:37,289
business packets in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business cube</font>

2199
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:39,449
and so what you see here is very good

2200
01:44:37,289 --> 01:44:43,009
because it tells you that the course of

2201
01:44:39,449 --> 01:44:45,690
stoning out where it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> deterministic</font>

2202
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:48,360
will you see that if you if your

2203
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:50,489
capacity planning is correct the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum</font>

2204
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:53,549
latency you will see as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as the</font>

2205
01:44:50,489 --> 01:44:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Q is not Luke is not overloaded</font>

2206
01:44:53,550 --> 01:45:02,280
it's smaller than 150 micro seconds so

2207
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:04,829
you could even use a well capacity plan

2208
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:08,489
business q sister support voice of IP

2209
01:45:04,829 --> 01:45:10,980
you would still be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> three four times</font>

2210
01:45:08,489 --> 01:45:13,570
better than the website for voice over

2211
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:15,519
IP and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a very important</font>

2212
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:17,500
world that you can have if you have a

2213
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,369
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> suit that is well capacity plan</font>

2214
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:23,020
the latency will be very good the other

2215
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:26,009
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Q is not going to affect the</font>

2216
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:28,810
latency and this is the nature

2217
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:31,989
improvement if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> contribute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

2218
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:34,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">70-200 over 7500 where it's much more</font>

2219
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:36,070
complex because it's handled by cpu so

2220
01:45:34,179 --> 01:45:39,219
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you can see that the</font>

2221
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:42,280
evolution of the technology and then

2222
01:45:39,219 --> 01:45:45,010
what we do also we then contact with you

2223
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:47,380
so once<font color="#CCCCCC"> we reach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 100 loading it</font>

2224
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:49,449
means that you becomes loaded you never

2225
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:51,610
want to operate a network in this

2226
01:45:49,449 --> 01:45:53,589
context for the business class and then

2227
01:45:51,610 --> 01:45:55,929
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you expect there is that the queue</font>

2228
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:58,239
is going to grow grow grow and grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

2229
01:45:55,929 --> 01:46:02,349
to a point where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is controlled by red</font>

2230
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:05,199
and the tuning we use in our suggested

2231
01:46:02,349 --> 01:46:08,949
design is with a pipe size of 100

2232
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:10,329
milliseconds and so we expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we</font>

2233
01:46:08,949 --> 01:46:12,879
keep unloading that queue and

2234
01:46:10,329 --> 01:46:15,460
overloading it it will go to an action

2235
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:17,739
on latency of 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michigan which is what</font>

2236
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:21,760
we saw here and again I was not

2237
01:46:17,739 --> 01:46:24,218
expecting that it would indeed do this i

2238
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:26,110
was expecting that it would have some

2239
01:46:24,219 --> 01:46:27,969
deviation so it's a good behavior as

2240
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:31,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">well but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not an important one</font>

2241
01:46:27,969 --> 01:46:33,820
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will operate a network at 50</font>

2242
01:46:31,179 --> 01:46:37,570
developed way that you at less than 50

2243
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:40,630
persons so you what you see is that you

2244
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:43,469
have very more ways to have high latency

2245
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:49,380
if you upper if you operated correctly

2246
01:46:43,469 --> 01:46:49,380
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skip this and confuse</font>

2247
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:54,799

latency and jittery another performance

2251

metric that you should think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

2253
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:09,530
you talk about SLS but it has a strong

2254
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:12,680
impact on availability last rate and

2255

that you should look at for optimizing

2315
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:58,400
so you need to analyze whether you are

<font color="#E5E5E5">the benefits to justify it so that's the</font>

together vis is work to to optimize the

01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:17,150
conversion so he did all recording so it

2322
01:50:15,290 --> 01:50:20,030
is really the word so if you have any

2323
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:23,349
question you can also ask him and

2324
