10

basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just map into the</font>

148
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,400
different different multimode in single

149
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:01,430
mode fiber types and also across

150
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,690
different distance requirements short

151
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,199
reach intermediate reaches long reach

152
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,479
etc and then finally the last one and

153
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,780
that's the ww DM that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listed on the</font>

154
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,680

155
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,659
multiplexing of wavelengths<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the</font>

156
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,210

158
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,849
so but again we're don't have a lot of

159
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,440
times going to the details should this

160
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows graphically some of the stuff have</font>

162
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,150
you got three is you have a Mac layer

163
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:42,469
interfacing so that's what IP would run

164

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,650
WD m and then the standard serial land

172
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,030
which is the the pair of fibers in the

of the standard things are actually

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty close to matter of fact they're</font>

184
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,020
about as close as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could be without</font>

185
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,969
actually being standardized at least

186
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,490
unless something happens this week so

187
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:47,810
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been happening in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 802 3ae</font>

188
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,550
working group the work started in 1999

189
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,520
within I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E there's a concept</font>

190
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,349
called a project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that allows the</font>

191
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,980
work to formally occur within I Triple E

192
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,000
so that project started in january 2002

193
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,720
january two thousand so about two and a

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,890
half years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago there's a status</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

195
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,660
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through all the gory details</font>

196
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,730
of like tripoli a standardization

197
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,410
process they all very different<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

198
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,320
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from IETF leave it at</font>

199
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a web page there that</font>

200
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,220
points to where as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

201
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,589
all works but basically it's a sponsor

202
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,210
ballot status now<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft 4.3 is the</font>

203
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:25,520
current version and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say</font>

204
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:27,650
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably not strong enough</font>

205
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,310
language but significant changes are

206
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,540
unlikely at this point even minor minor

207
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,390
changes are pretty unlikely at this

208
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,709
point the final ratification of the

209
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,330
standard is supposed to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week</font>

210
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">in one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E meetings</font>

211
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,250
so on as long as that happens then it

212
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,200
just takes a couple more<font color="#E5E5E5"> months for them</font>

213
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,460
to do some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> editorial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cleanup and</font>

214
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,060
things like that at least potentially

215
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,730
and then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue the standard but</font>

216
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,459
basically it's done from an

217
00:09:52,730 --> 00:10:01,850
interoperability perspective at interop

218
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:04,640
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> May so a month so ago they had a one</font>

219
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:09,080
of the regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop test demo kind of</font>

220
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,449
things so in the actual equipment demo

221
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,270
the press release<font color="#CCCCCC"> said something like 24</font>

222
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,710
vendors part says AR 24 participants or

223
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,270
something like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

224
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,589
more more closely some of that was

225
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,000
equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors some of it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tube</font>

226
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:21,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">meanders talking about the different</font>

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">kinds of chip interoperability and</font>

228
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,560
things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway a bunch of</font>

229
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">different equipment was connected</font>

230
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,390
together at interop in in May and

231
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,920
there's again to press release<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web</font>

232
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">pages there so you can kind of check</font>

233
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,370
that out and see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact status</font>

234
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:39,890
was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to wrap things up it's</font>

235
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,680
pretty viable at least at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

236
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,500
Juniper perspective we think so the

237
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,689
standard is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically complete products</font>

238
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,660
are shipping including switch interfaces

239
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,279
router interfaces test equipment on the

240
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,640
appropriate cables kind of all the

241
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:58,529
pieces that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to deploy 10 gige</font>

242
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:02,459
are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ready</font>

243
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:05,490
and with any technology of course it's

244
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:08,089
this is new however so there will

245
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,579
probably be at least a little bit of

246
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:13,290
ongoing ongoing potholes in there in the

247
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,550
road so make sure you check<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

248
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,248
interoperability and things like that

249
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you go too overboard there are</font>

250
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:20,779
some interoperability testing happening

251
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:23,219
at the University of New Hampshire

252
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:25,709
interoperability lab and of course

253
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,389
interop the inter operative alts of

254
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,579
course our trade show interoperability

255

results take those with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a grain of salt</font>

256
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,628
you know those are done with all the

257
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:35,699
carefully crafted some smokin ears and

258
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:38,189
all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the UNH test results</font>

259
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:41,729
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually pretty pretty solid and of</font>

260
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:44,610
course products are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> just coming on</font>

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the market now so you need to test for</font>

262
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:52,709
maturity in that regard also um excuse

263
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,809
me so there may be products<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

00:12:55,499 --> 00:13:01,290
center on deployment of 10 gigabit

289
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:05,069
ethernet service last fall or something

290
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:07,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">and again so the bunch of presentations</font>

291
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:10,290
are are there that provide some

292
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,360
perspective on the use of 10 gige

293
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,250
include

294
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,930
10 gige in the wind and how it might how

295
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:19,630
it might fit so i guess that is all has

296
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:23,779
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went through fast enough to</font>

297
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:25,640
bring us in time for lunch and mr. bill

298
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,750
Woodcock walking up to the microphone

299
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,310
for go<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a little bit of</font>

300
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:35,779
prognostication do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yeah sure</font>

301
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:38,689
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay depends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean copper you</font>

302
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:41,980
say not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in standard so is this going to</font>

303
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:45,019
be sort of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Giggy was where you know</font>

304
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,060
year two years from now the problems of

305
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,790
physics will be overcome by<font color="#E5E5E5"> force of</font>

306
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,569
money and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have you know meter 2</font>

307
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,670
meter<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 meter copper interconnects yeah</font>

308
00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:00,190
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty good question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

309
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:02,329
actually relates to some of the other on

310
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,130
to another question which I thought use

311
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,329
what you may have asked so only answer

312
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:09,079
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question and the other question</font>

313
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,790
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> anticipation which is basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

314
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,459
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the motivations for doing</font>

315
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:16,719
some like that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be cost</font>

316
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:19,310
for the interfaces themselves and

317
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,839
presumably I guess fibers not that much

318
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">more expensive than copper these days</font>

319
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,690
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least the interfaces would</font>

320
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:28,430
presumably to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cheaper so you know</font>

321
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:32,570
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will it happen I don't know I'm</font>

322
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:35,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a I'm not a physics guy is it is it</font>

323
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,820
possible you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to deny</font>

324
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:39,560
that it's that it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

325
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,730
it's certainly within the realm of

326
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,859
possibility i mean we build

327
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,230
interconnects inside the routers and

328
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:50,000
stuff like that that certainly run at

329
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:51,350
those kinds of speeds so so a question

330
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,769
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know could we really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

331
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:57,620
it cheaper um if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at an interface</font>

332
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,570
that costs are in there's there's a

333
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of peaches in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and this</font>

334
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of relates to the other question</font>

335
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,970
right this buffering there's some kind

336
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,449
of forwarding engine or at least a some

337
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:12,440
mechanism for taking the frames off the

338
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:14,149
off the physical media and then sending

339
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,709
it into the switch fabric etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah go</font>

340
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:17,750
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> so those in the audience who don't</font>

341
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,630
know could you give people<font color="#E5E5E5"> some idea of</font>

342
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:23,829
what the cost of an interface is right

343
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:28,729
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

344
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:30,348
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question um that's a good</font>

345
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,699
question you know we just announced ours

346
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:33,619
and I really have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea what it costs</font>

347
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:35,508
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sales guy or any any juniper</font>

348
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:37,069
people or anybody else in the audience

349
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:41,119
from any vendors who could provide some

350
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:44,238
insight I just don't know at least at

351
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:48,939
least I know ours ours ours<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at least</font>

352
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:53,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">not dramatically less expensive than the</font>

353
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:55,639
10 gigabit sonnet interfaces it's not

354
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:57,379
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of order of magnitude</font>

355
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,619
difference that people were anticipating

356
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:02,779
or at least some some were promoting

357
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:04,579
that you know ethernet is going to be so

358
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:07,629
vastly cheaper than the sonnet that

359
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:09,679
you'll get it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> free relative and</font>

360
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:10,849
that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> where 0 is going</font>

361
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically if you look at an interface</font>

362
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:14,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs a lot of the pieces are all the</font>

363
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:17,749
same the optics are the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> the framers</font>

364
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:19,399
are slightly different<font color="#E5E5E5"> but close</font>

365
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:21,709
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way in</font>

366
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,999
five or 10 Gigabit Ethernet and then you

367
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:26,899
need to put buffering on the interface

368
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:28,519
and all the other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it kind</font>

369
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,239
of is a wash from our perspective in

370
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,969
terms of component costs yeah there's a

371
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:38,989
perception that in producing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

372
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:42,199
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've screwed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and that</font>

373
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:45,739
there's a essentially a land version and

374
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:48,618
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> LAN version the advantage of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gigabit</font>

375
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:51,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">ethernet was that the chips were</font>

376
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:54,079
produced in mass quantity and therefore

377
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:56,929
work cheap so by having two versions one

378
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,138
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is applicable to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the land if that</font>

379
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:01,728
one is mass-produced and the other one

380
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:03,829
isn't then it doesn't have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage</font>

381
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:07,429
of being cheap and since they only put

382
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:09,198
the error detection in the one that's

383
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:12,339
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap then there's no incentive to</font>

384
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,899
not just use sign right right well

385
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:18,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually it couple of comments on that I</font>

386
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:19,908
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're right on track</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and its</font>

387
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:22,519
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case the optics are</font>

388
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:24,529
becoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dominant the dominant piece</font>

389
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:28,730
and it's again kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same right</font>

390
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:32,509
and if you start using<font color="#E5E5E5"> winds way and</font>

391
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,580
flies then about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only thing you do</font>

392
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,350
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get a little more overhead</font>

393
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,149
for for sonnet framing and the error

394
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,110
correction it one of the other things

395
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,780
which I didn't put it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

396
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,689
presentation because is there there is

397
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,700
some error as well I guess it's better

398
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,039
characterizes fault monitoring and Link

399
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,160
monitoring in 10 gige at a link level

400
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,280
which is new also so the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

401
00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:00,230
little better than then the other

402
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:03,740
ethernet technologies in that regard<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

403
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,740
yeah just wondering if we could do a

404
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,809
show of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands of people interested in</font>

405
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,700
deploying the 10 gig interfaces in the

406
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,840
short term 10 Gigabit Ethernet yeah sure

407
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,690
whatever so if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

408
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,149
playing 10gb ethernet interfaces in the

409
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:28,570
short term being calendar year 2000 to

410
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:33,860
say raise your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand it was that helpful</font>

411
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:36,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I guess we're I</font>

412
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,320
don't see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions so thanks</font>

413
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,320
very much
