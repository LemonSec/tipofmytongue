00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about our new who is the first</font>

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">question you may have is why are we</font>

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting out a new who is the primary</font>

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason is that we are updating our</font>

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,250
database our registration database and

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:34,410
and making some enhancements to that and

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:36,559
it will affect our who is some of the

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,779
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we will be adding are</font>

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,559
different POC types including abuse

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,170
administrative knock and technical we

13
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,468
are introducing a new organizational

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,129
object and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are no longer requiring</font>

15
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:57,840
that you include IP addresses with the

16
00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:02,280
name servers some of the improvements

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are specific to who is our that we</font>

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,920
are adding labels to everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

19
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:14,729
all the fields in who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to facilitate</font>

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:18,360
parsing by machines we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:24,030
include<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registration date we are</font>

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:27,539
providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> slider notation for the IP</font>

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,460
blocks and we are also identifying the

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,619
upstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp handle some things that you</font>

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know about the data testing is</font>

26
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:42,270
that the purpose of it is that people

27
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,250
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rewrite script probably I don't</font>

28
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a very large percentage of our</font>

29
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,280
queries are coming from scripts and we

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,179
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people time enough to</font>

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:58,740
rewrite them the data that's on server

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:02,460
is scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's i believe it was done</font>

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,560
august sorry April thirtieth and we have

34
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,880
no intention of updating it later just

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,810
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't want people minding</font>

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,090
that data the

37
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,100
queries can be answered on court<font color="#CCCCCC"> 43 44</font>

38
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,860
again there's too many crawlers out

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:22,480
there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> signed it on 43 and we want</font>

40
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:26,320
to limit the queries to just people that

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing beta testing we have</font>

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,870
not put any v6 objects from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database</font>

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:37,920
yet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get to it but we haven't</font>

44
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:41,650
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yet and we are not completed</font>

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,708
everything and all the querying options

46
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:49,680
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yet implemented the name of the</font>

server is<font color="#CCCCCC"> beta Darren bitte sehr nett</font>

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,809
beta testing is open today we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

49
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,090
any comments from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you up until August</font>

50
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,920
second and then on the twelfth<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> August</font>

51
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:10,780
we will be releasing the new who is

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,488
we've set up a website that will tell

53
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,340
you the various stages of the different

54
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:21,549
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> and will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also list some of the</font>

55
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:24,430
known bugs and there's also a link from

56
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:29,140
there that will allow you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:33,250
bugs that you may find or you can send

58
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:36,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to our DB WG mailing list we</font>

59
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">established the online tool so that you</font>

60
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:44,340
don't need to be a member of our list

61
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:50,920
just to report some of your findings and

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:56,220
that's it I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,220
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the queries that would I want</font>

64
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:08,879
you can either<font color="#CCCCCC"> telnet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you come in here</font>

65
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:16,949
tell that to it should directly to it

66
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:20,608
using 40 and run a query and it will

67
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:22,400
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you then you will show you whatever</font>

68
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,859
you have or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can figure out how to</font>

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,479
set up your<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is client to go directly</font>

70
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,479
to 43 44

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,480
you can do it that way I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

72
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,250
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple queries and show you some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:52,550
the known bugs that that we are aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

74
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:56,570
as you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on here the first thing</font>

75
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:59,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pops out is that for if you do a</font>

76
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,969
query<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a single AF it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showing it as</font>

77
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,979
the start and the end which well it's

78
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,040
not necessarily wrong but it really

79
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:11,750
should only showed this to 45 in this

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,880
case also<font color="#CCCCCC"> one here the comments field</font>

81
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,340
really shouldn't be displayed if there's

82
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,070
no comments we need to remove the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

83
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:23,030
off the registration date and the last

84
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,419
updated it is is we actually have a date

85
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not showing up in here</font>

86
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:33,530
another known bug is that if you query

87
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:39,560
on the on a / 8 it finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> both the AF and</font>

88
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:41,960
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> /a another known bug is it's not</font>

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:53,300
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for partial it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not returning</font>

90
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:56,060
anything another known bug is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cider</font>

91
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">notation isn't completely working</font>

92
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,950
properly it looks like it's pulling the

93
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:07,130
first networks number and the last

94
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:12,830
fighter block excuse me this<font color="#E5E5E5"> last night</font>

95
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">or prefix another thing that's not</font>

96
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:19,789
working is query any<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries that have a</font>

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment we will fix all these we just</font>

98
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:26,750
couldn't get them all finished before

99
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:29,950
today some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the advantages or some of</font>

100
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the new things that are out there</font>

101
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:45,740
you'll see on here that the upstream

102
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:47,809
network handle is here and it's you know

103
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,759
if you do a query and you find that

104
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:52,699
you're not getting any response from

105
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">them no mailbox at nowhere com you may</font>

106
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,479
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the upstream and find out</font>

107
00:06:54,229 --> 00:07:01,210
you can get a piece of POC from there

108
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:05,029
and here you can go do a quick query

109
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:10,489
against the upstream and find your POC

110
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:21,379
there that ends my presentation unless

111
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:22,669
anybody has any questions well we have

112
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,259

113
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:33,008
have any go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and step up to the</font>

114
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:36,610
microphone no questions everyone gets it
