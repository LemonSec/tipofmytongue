00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,329
that may trigger some memories or some

285
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,370
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may look at it and go what in the</font>

286
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,899
heck is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it on</font>

287
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,310
transparencies because that's the way we

288
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:21,660
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it but I didn't know we'd</font>

289
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,660
have a transparency machine

290
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,259
so take me just a minute

291
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,810
you

292
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:50,820
ok

293
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:52,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so while the first regional text</font>

294
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,080
meetings we put up a slide that looks

295
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:58,290
much like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in front of you and I</font>

296
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,510
didn't I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put any titles on it on</font>

297
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,730
purpose just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I didn't know if</font>

298
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">any of you be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to guess what what we</font>

299
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:07,710
were trying to present to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers</font>

300
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,380
that were attached to the NSFNET network

301
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:13,380
and what information<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were trying to</font>

302
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,930
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them so I'm opening this two</font>

303
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:20,210
guesses from the audience would<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

304
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to say what this graph represents</font>

305
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:31,279
route table growth absolutely correct so

306
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:35,670
as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see in the first bar is July</font>

307
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:38,730
1988 we had 217 nets on the NSFNET

308
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:42,209
backbone and we were so proud we were

309
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:46,080
really happy people and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> GM December</font>

310
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:52,830
of that same year<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had 346 you can see</font>

311
00:15:46,080 --> 00:16:01,589
it was growing by leaps and bounds who

312
00:15:52,830 --> 00:16:04,290
woulda thunk I'm sorry so then as the

313
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,480
NSFNET continued to grow as you can see

314
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't think it's linear anymore but oh</font>

315
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,190
no this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our growth path and in 95</font>

316
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,460
this is actually februari of 95 so it

317
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:21,120
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a few more we got all the</font>

318
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:24,900
way up to about 46,000 and some routes

319
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,960
in the NSFNET backbone it was a pretty

320
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,500
phenomenal project and as you know in 94

321
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,180
is when nanog started so for those of

322
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,320
you who couldn't get all the dots on the

323
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:41,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that chart in 88 we had 217 nets in the</font>

324
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,040
network in 94 when cider took place we

325
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,350
kind of stopped counting them by A's B's

326
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,469
and C's if you go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old church till</font>

327
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:53,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">cnet count and all those 217 are broken</font>

328
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:57,240
up by a bezoar fees and then also 94 is

329
00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:00,020
when then I've started and in 95 when

330
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,080
the NSFNET was retired we were just over

331
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,960
46,000

332
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I couldn't find a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of charts that</font>

333
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,839
would give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me information on a network</font>

334
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:12,870
routing table a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks don't share</font>

335
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,909
that data anymore but Tony Bates put in

336
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:17,520
place a program a long long time ago

337
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,560
when he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at ripe and it's still</font>

338
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,910
available and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get the data from</font>

339
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:26,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">a wide perspective wives the Japanese</font>

340
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:28,170
networking and research group and right

341
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,430
now they've got a hundred and fourteen

342
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:34,920
thousand as of the june 2002 report so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

343
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:38,640
just thought since this is the 25th

344
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,710
nanog and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSFNET</font>

345
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,810
kicked off the regional text which grew

346
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,640
into this organization would be kind of

347
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,790
fun to share this information with you

348
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,850
and since Susan mentioned how many

349
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:54,200
international attendees we have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

350
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:57,510
North American network operators group I

351
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,740
click the chart out where it shows the

352
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:03,090
non-us net that were part of the

353
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:07,110
networks that were the on the NSFNET

354
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:08,760
backbone as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell in 1988 where</font>

355
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,399
you can't hardly see any nets at all

356
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,610
there were a total of nine networks that

357
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,890
were considered international non-us

358
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,840
myths because the NSFNET of course had

359
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:22,410
very restrictive policies as to who we

360
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,280
allowed to route by the time we closed

361
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:29,100
the network in 1995 there were over

362
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,220
19,000 and now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think except for</font>

363
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin and ripe and AP Nick that we don't</font>

364
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">really look at IP addresses as being</font>

365
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,500
allocated as non-us or us
