5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,980
just three major areas first we're going

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a review of how to measure IP</font>

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,289
network availability and then the test

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,049
coverage to actually test to achieve

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,269
five nines of availability and that what

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,490
we need the commercial test equipment

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,890
vendors to do so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:39,019

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:42,750
realize why availability<font color="#CCCCCC"> is important</font>

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,309
reliability means more revenue research

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,379
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now in the IP networks there's a</font>

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,189
need for redundant routers and that's

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,080
not done in other networks so some

IEPs solution graceful restart even

63
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,769
though there's still some question<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,050
that actually achieves five nines of

65
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,570
router availability so the question I'm

66
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,850
posing here and hopefully answering is

67
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,519
what what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing could be done on</font>

68
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,650
routers today to achieve five nines of

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,460
graceful restart and then addition of

72
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,040
those features<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually achieved six</font>

73
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,690

74
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's possible and I'm going to go</font>

75
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,340
through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> program that I think</font>

76
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,800
works to get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope you all agree</font>

77
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,990
as I'm sure all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know testing is</font>

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,680
never done right you can go on testing

79
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,130
forever so if anyone has inputs on that

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,540
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve the testing please</font>

stressed scaling testing is not stress

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,320
testing so deployed routers run multiple

95
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,660

99
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,420
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the test program to do that</font>

100
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,910
and therefore verify five nines of

156
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,849
time it won't be so what are some

157
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,030
typical stress metrics well these are

158
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:04,128
per hour and I'm not crazy this is the

159

way these<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be tested slap 1</font>

kidding around I'm saying under stress

do all that enable the logging<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

third<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pete third component of this and</font>

186
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,389
that's the convergence testing so

187
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:15,949
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> three different terms for</font>

188
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,199
convergence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> get thrown around and</font>

189
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">they kind of get mixed up so let's just</font>

190
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,279
clarify here where we're going to focus

191
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,919
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> network convergence is the point in</font>

192
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,449
time in which all networks in all nodes

193
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,839
in the network have updated the routing

194
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,219
tables versus protocol convergence which

195
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,828
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time in which a single note</font>

196
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,809
updates its routing table and advertises

197
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:37,698
the change to its peer and then the

198
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">third one which is route convergence</font>

199
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:41,809
that's the point in time in which a

200
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,570
single mode updates its routing table

201
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:48,229
and reroutes traffic out the new

202
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,940
interface that is that term router<font color="#CCCCCC"> rub</font>

203
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,020
convergence is the one that's actually

204
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,840
been used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in labs as the</font>

205
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:59,610
benchmark tool to evaluate convergence

206
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,290
performance of a router so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

207
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,310
test issues with convergence well of

208
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,260
course there's a large number of

209
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,170
protocols in which to test convergence

210
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,540
so this can go on for many weeks there

211
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,240
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of conditions that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact back</font>

212
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten impacts results will hit those on</font>

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,050
the next slide and then there's of

214
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,640
course technical difficulty in doing

215
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,859
this because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test</font>

216
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,710
convergence when there's instability of

217
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,930
one protocol impacting another protocol

218
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,390
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> test equipment needs to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

219
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:31,170
to closely control that and monitor that

220
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,150
monitor that to make the measurements so

221
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,740
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the test conditions so you know</font>

222
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,110
you've heard over<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially yesterday</font>

223
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot to talk about convergence</font>

224
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some ones are saying you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

225
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,630
convergence is awesome and you know it's

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,340
better than those guys be sure what

227
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,680
you're testing convergence in your lab

228
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:50,120
that you test all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conditions because</font>

229
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:54,270
you will get different<font color="#E5E5E5"> results when you</font>

230
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you force the convergence first one</font>

231
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,130
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface shutdown do it on the local</font>

232
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,569
interface do it on the remote interface

233
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,939
fiber pull yeah you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font>

234
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,380
result in interface shut down and make

235
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure you do it on the local and the</font>

236
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,810
remote interfaces do peer removal via

237
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,530
the CL eyes yeah take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole pier</font>

238
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:15,869
away actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> force a node failure power</font>

239
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,790
down a pit neighboring pier and measure

240
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,560
convergence and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there's</font>

241
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,810
the convergence times due to<font color="#CCCCCC"> round table</font>

242
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,670
changes and as many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those route</font>

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,430

245
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,219
and even a policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> change I'd be wary if</font>

246
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,599
your router vendors telling you to pick

247
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">one or two of these and that's the way</font>

248
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,310
to do the measurement that usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

249
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ways the result is not as</font>

250
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,910
good so make sure you do complete

251
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:48,390
coverage in your testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

252
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,709
specific topology testing this is really

253
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">important because when it comes to</font>

254
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,250
deployment you want it to work on day

255
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,340
one so it's important the router vendor

256
00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:00,210
and also the network provider do testing

257
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">on its topology specific a good good</font>

258
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,960
network would include<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten routers with</font>

259
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,240
multiple vendors in it and of course

260
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple protocol</font>

261
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,620
actually configured in a deployment

262
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,630
scenario and then run through actual

263
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,700
deployment scenarios failure conditions

264
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:18,529
you've seen in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network test those</font>

265
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,720
before actually deploying so the fifth

266
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:24,950
component of this test program is

267
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,660
automated regression testing regression

268
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,700
testing is critical because over time

269
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,800
we're adding the router vendors we're

270
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,060
adding bug fixes to our images and of

271
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">course we're adding the new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> features</font>

272
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,739
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you demand that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

273
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,370
release as we add this new stuff it

274
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,560
impacts the operation of the software

275
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,839
from the previous releases so it's

276
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,069
critical<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back and always check and</font>

277
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,140
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the way things have been</font>

278
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,360
working in your network are the way

279
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,699
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will still work in your network</font>

280
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,790
when the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> features are deployed now</font>

281
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,279
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means is over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

282
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,500
over years there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff to go</font>

283
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,670
back in a regression test so the only

284
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,580
way you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get through all that</font>

285
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:10,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do full coverage is to automate the</font>

286
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:13,700
regression testing actually let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out for automation of regression</font>

288
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,360
testing there's just a basic

289
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,829
configuration that can be used it's

290
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,779
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> won the test equipment vendors</font>

291
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:22,849
have been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with as well right</font>

292
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,010

the requirements to do all this testing

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,280
think it's a great feature is you can

actually load externally a BGP table for

413
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,890
think that's an absolute requirement

that way you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dump of</font>

output right in from a file and that's

417
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:30,530
the rub table that will use for its

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,320
protocol emulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's a</font>

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,810
fantastic feature and then also we need

421
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:42,080

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,090
protocols like I was mentioning we never

439
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,039
run in an isolated protocol environment

440
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,289
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need testing that has multiple</font>

441
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,980
protocols running simultaneously and

442
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:30,679
then have automatic automated pass/fail

443
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,159
measurement when one protocol impacts

444
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,809
another protocol and another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is we</font>

445
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,429
need to we need the scripts to test

446
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:39,168
multiple interfaces it's not sufficient

447
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do protocol testing on a couple</font>

448
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:43,600
interfaces we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need to emulate a</font>

449
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,669
larger network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need four or more</font>

450
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,490
interfaces actually tested when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

451
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:51,409
the scripts and of course we need the

452
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,120
full protocol coverage and again I

453
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:58,270
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi kaskell you forgotten</font>

454
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">son and then the last slide for the</font>

455
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,629
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the test equipment</font>

456
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:07,010
vendors are the system requirements as

457
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:09,140
as ports as routers are getting more

458
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,789
dense with number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports the test</font>

459
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,460
equipment vendors need to keep up and

460
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:15,590
it's not realistic now to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

461
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,720
test equipment box that has less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

462
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,449
interfaces is sufficient for testing a

463
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,860
core router I put the number 32 here in

464
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,049
fact I think I'm being too<font color="#E5E5E5"> conservative</font>

465
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,449
I I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be a lot larger</font>

466
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:29,270
than that probably double that 64 if not

467
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,620
higher automated convergence measurement

468
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,360
we've all<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

469
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,820
important convergences now wouldn't it

470
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,590
be cool if the convergence measurements

471
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,658
were actually automated so we didn't

472
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,270
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think too much about it there</font>

473
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,529
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some standard procedure which</font>

474
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,600
it was done that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the way the test</font>

475
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:46,010
equipment vendors did it and we could

476
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,918
just press a<font color="#E5E5E5"> button and go and then get</font>

477
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,480
our get our output for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time we need</font>

00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">automated rear out and failover</font>

479
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,620
measurement for for mpls we need support

480
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,299
for ecmp in composite links those are

481
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,229
deployed in real networks it would be

482
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,480
great if we could test<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">ordering with those and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also with</font>

484
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,030
protocols being emulated over those then

485
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,549
of course with a stress testing over

486
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:13,070
many days we definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> need system and</font>

487
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:15,290
protocol stability the test equipment

488
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,178
needs to be as reliable as the routers

489
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,010
under test they just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay up</font>

490
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,340
when we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this stuff over</font>

491
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,580
many days we need the ability to store a

492
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,290
GUI configuration for repeatability and

493
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:30,290
we need the ability to write a TCL

494
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,820
script for any GUI test case so a lot of

495
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,620
us when we do our testing we do with the

496
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,570
GUI first and then we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go off</font>

497
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,330
after perfecting it in the GUI we want

498
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,668
to automate it by a TCL we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

499
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,500
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> every everything we come up</font>

500
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:48,110
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the GUI is in fact automatable</font>

501
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,820
in TCL so that is all I had for core

502
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,559
router testing for high availability and

503
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:57,290
I'd certainly welcome any questions at

504
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:59,629
this point hi so um a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thats a</font>

505
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,870
nice wish list and you know I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

506
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,120
a good portion of it some of it I don't

507
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,409
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any insight into but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

508
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,719
still hung up on something you said at

509
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:12,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the very beginning okay you said you saw</font>

510
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,980
a survey and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey said that</font>

511
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,929
customers buy based on reliability right

512
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't laugh at</font>

513
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,380
that and go find somebody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

514
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,678
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get truthful answers</font>

515
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,840
out of customers I mean you believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

516
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,270
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that customers care about</font>

517
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,059
the difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5-9 from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 69s</font>

518
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:34,340
reliability do you have an SLA do are

519
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:37,100
you a network operator yes do you have s

520
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,840
la's for your customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm I've tried</font>

521
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past number one so you don't</font>

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,149
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hate for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it your excuse me</font>

523
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:47,780
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are willing to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

524
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:50,299
money for la's right but is it is it

525
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,910
written is<font color="#CCCCCC"> david a contract with a</font>

526
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:54,950
guaranteed SLA yes I've done or goes in

527
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,140
the past it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a bad idea because it</font>

528
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't make any money the best climbers</font>

529
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:05,350
aren't willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay for reliability</font>

530
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:07,730
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested in price price</font>

531
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,850
they'll buy the cheapest service they

532
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,920
can get then

533
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,719
are you a router vendor yes I am I'm

534
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,360
from it probably ever sold a product

535
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,750
with SL a's two people have you ever

536
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,189
sold a product with SL a's two people am

537
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,390
I allowed to speak specifically about

538
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:29,430
avicii<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will answer that question in</font>

539
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,840
fact last week at super calm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Avicii made</font>

540
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,520
an announcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are in fact</font>

544
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:46,890
service credit absolutely also<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I'm</font>

545
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">very impressed actually correctly</font>

546
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,010
because we believe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

547
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,649

548
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:56,760
confident in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure you should</font>

549
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:58,980
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'll get to that ok but because</font>

550
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,480
we were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a conversation out</font>

551
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,090
in the hall which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of the you</font>

552
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,309
know let's do you know settlements on

553
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,480
peering just tell me which direction you

554
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:07,980
know it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and i'll just go</font>

555
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,240
retire after i collect money for a

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple months either pulling or sending</font>

557
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,620
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> with s Eleison routers I</font>

558
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:16,410
question whether I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all</font>

559
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,419
really good stuff I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it goes</font>

560
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:21,540
far enough for what you'd need to be

561
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to issue service credits in other</font>

562
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,010
words you no refunds on pieces of

563
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,660
routers all right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'm going</font>

564
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,820
to speak for<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill the channel bill a</font>

565
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,240
little bit and to say my own feeling is

566
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,970
that empirically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see providers asking</font>

567
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,640
for new features and new protocols and

568
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,950
not saying I won't buy your box unless

569
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me an SLA which is why for the</font>

570
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">last 10 years router vendors haven't</font>

571
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,679
given s la's because if everyone said I

572
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,330
won't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this unless you x all right I</font>

573
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's why a lot of people in the</font>

574
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,949
provider community are suspicious of any

575
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,390
assumption that the people who buy

576
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:58,340
routers you know care deeply about

577
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:01,380
reliability yeah anyway so that was

578
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:05,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">haven't there's a few points to be made</font>

579
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,780
there I think the reason is that demands

580
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,000
haven't been made unavailability of

581
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,649
routers is over the years network

582
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,010
operators are just come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

583
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,140
realization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> router suck yes we know</font>

584
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's yeah people who they to</font>

585
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:21,300
people who

586
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:24,270
do try to base their purchases primarily

587
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,820
on or more on robustness and then there

588
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,950
other people networks whatever who

589
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,659
clearly want features because they think

590
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,190
that drives revenue and not robustness

591
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,260
in other words people will pay for

592
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,670
converged you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can save money with</font>

593
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,340
conversion network<font color="#CCCCCC"> or people will pay</font>

594
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:41,430
for this VPN service that I can offer to

595
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,530
them versus people will pay for SLA

596
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:47,490
which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think has been you know an issue</font>

597
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:49,200
for everyone it's oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a major carrier</font>

598
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,240
will operate multiple networks of an IP

599
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,760
network of voice network an ATM network

600
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,460
and quite often the CEO is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the</font>

601
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,680
guys who run the IP network saying why

602
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,360
aren't you as profitable as the other

603
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,150
networks why are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting more</font>

604
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,719
customers for the ATM<font color="#E5E5E5"> network why are we</font>

605
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:08,250
making more money on the ATM network and

606
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,220
the reason for that it goes right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

607
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:13,530
points of reliability actually being the

608
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,540
key the reason major carriers now are

609
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,310
selling more ATM services it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

610
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,010
reliable right now so it's time the

611
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:22,560
router vendors change that it's great

612
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,390
wait yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> different okay so so</font>

613
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,000
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just try a test case here let's</font>

614
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:30,420
say I'm carrier and like many carriers

615
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm selling for 3995 a month a DSL</font>

616
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,470
service that cost me about 300 a month

617
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,620
to provide let's say I make it more

618
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,180
reliable yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now it only cost</font>

619
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,090
me four hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty dollars to</font>

620
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,070
provide yeah okay how much more customer

621
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,689
going to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yes it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so</font>

622
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:49,050
you're missing the point the reason

623
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,790
you're charging 3995 is not to compete

624
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,050
against the other IP networks it's to

625
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,540
compete against<font color="#E5E5E5"> those other more</font>

626
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,149
reliable networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if it's more</font>

627
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,010
reliable you will get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers and</font>

628
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,570
more revenue and there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

629
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,879
demand for your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

630
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,090
charge a higher price wait to porn

631
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,740
you're a better wait if it's more

632
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,510
reliable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can charge a higher price</font>

633
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,780
that's right because you can have higher

634
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">SLS right now you're offering lower SLA</font>

635
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,250
s on your IP network are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> offering</font>

636
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,360
the same SLA s on your IP network and

637
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:24,120
your ATM that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were probably as well his</font>

638
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,580
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pair which I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font>

639
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone companies yeah I mean he</font>

640
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,480
was used as you know network operators

641
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,840
do he was using to degenerate

642
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">I use an overloaded operator but I just</font>

643
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">let me back off from it and say I think</font>

644
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:40,469
that if there's a vendor who is offering

645
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">a money back guarantee on a piece of the</font>

646
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:46,080
router if there's a catastrophic failure

647
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,730
that's an awesome thing and I actually

648
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of business models to make</font>

649
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of money right now ha ha ha ha ha</font>

650
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,860
but as an entrepreneur but the one thing

651
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,350
that I would say is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this ties to it</font>

652
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,449
I've often thought that you know there's

653
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,969
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of creativity that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the teenagers</font>

654
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,640
and malcontents seem to have about how

655
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,860
to send malformed multicast packets that

656
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,950
crash you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know every Cisco in my network</font>

657
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,809
or how to exacerbate some problem or the

658
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,910
notified behavior in BGP how to tickle

659
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,770
that by releasing malformed updates that

660
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,020
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors parts one way or another I</font>

661
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,150
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's another dimension which is</font>

662
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,860
to get truly evil with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

663
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,780
me would actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get money back</font>

664
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,639
as a consultant you know get money back

665
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,240
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who buy your devices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

666
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Julie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right if you have an SLA is to</font>

667
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,510
really think about all the degenerate

668
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,160
cases around these protocols which is

669
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">really where a lot of the attacks come</font>

670
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:41,070
from is not just playing you know what

671
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,049
the show IP bgp was but try to figure

672
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,270
out you know have people do code review

673
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:47,940
have paid bonuses to people who are

674
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">really think evilly young to do this</font>

675
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,500
that's just my advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that people who</font>

676
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an engineering background often</font>

677
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,929
aren't capable of enough creative evil

678
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,760
to really exercise a lot of cases here

679
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:02,250
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that will actually be</font>

680
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,740
important if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an SLA and again</font>

681
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,880
in all seriousness<font color="#CCCCCC"> i applaud that yeah</font>

682
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really great on having a</font>

683
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily on our backs and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you</font>

684
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,330
made an excellent point and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one</font>

685
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:17,210
that should be recognized any any other

686
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,210
questions at this point all right
