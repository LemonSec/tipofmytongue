1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,460
essentially you know it's you know we

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,810
have a you know is the sky falling with

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,150
border gateway protocol do we have a big

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,809
security problem with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> um now</font>

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully for most of the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here I</font>

6
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:19,560
hope but that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is like no</font>

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,300
da my best common practices with best BG

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,580
border gateway protocol configurations

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,029
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> help to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add a lot of security</font>

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,299
robustness in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but</font>

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">post-911</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of new people coming</font>

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,239
into security and infrastructure

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,280
protection and you know what's going on

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the critical infrastructures of the</font>

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,480
nation's network you know and then

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,459
there's a perception that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,309
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now a critical infrastructure they</font>

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,020
all started saying oh wow<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok border</font>

19
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,459
gateway protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> the International of</font>

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,110
course we add in this room caffeine

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,610
those those are the three core critical

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,079
infrastructures of the internet right

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,420
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep all three now uh you</font>

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,219
know so the question is is there a

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,140
security problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> border gateway protocol</font>

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,439
and one of the things I ran I ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,150
is is me you know I have an attack lab

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,070
or a cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do security all the time I</font>

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,990
work with security teams and ISPs and

30
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,210
all sudden I get holding with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">government and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they said oh uh there's</font>

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,689
week there's a ass bgp protocol hence

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,900
there must be a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and bgp</font>

34
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,470
is totally insecure right so you get

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,270
this this mismatch right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i look at</font>

36
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and say well wait a minute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

37
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,000
seeing you know the internet falling

38
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,880
down around us<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so we work</font>

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,159
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> October last year when we started</font>

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a lot of new new people coming in</font>

41
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying there's a security problem</font>

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,140
there's a security problem and they have

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,130
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> perception there's a security</font>

44
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,630

obvious going to talk about pulled

47
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,390
together a bunch of operators and

48
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,079
actually they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty clue fold I</font>

49
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,030
mean a dick clark's organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,039
pretty pretty cool entrain de find clue

51
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,960
full people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who actually was doing the</font>

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,879
job out there and polos together in a

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,199
working group get into that working

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,670
group and immediately I find out that

55
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,630
again I'm running in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this perception</font>

56
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,239
that there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big problem</font>

57
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,980
all I we dive in there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a</font>

58
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,930
colleague a couple of colleagues<font color="#CCCCCC"> sits I</font>

59
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,250
got a list of lists of us and behind a

60
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,570
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who loosen couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peel</font>

61
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">from juniper a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in BD</font>

62
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">pbn who all kind of dived in and said</font>

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,920
what is really the risk assessment and

64
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,920
on the on the site we got a little wet

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,359
what would a white paper and we got this

66
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,130
presentation that works off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> white</font>

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,910
paper to say do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about</font>

68
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">something right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now all right um so so I</font>

69
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,320
off we go now you know luckily you know

70
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">our luck still holds out I you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

71
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a nice pre you know reasonably</font>

72
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,790
operationally stable internet out there

73
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,830
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we also have been lucky</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

74
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,570
that we've gained a lot of security

75
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,040
resistance just because of all the

76
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,989
operational lessons we've learned over

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,549
the years you know all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

78
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,620
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> or cider and the things we had to</font>

79
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,960
do for cider added security resistance

80
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,210
all the stuff that happen with our rap

81
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,890
dampening experience a lot of security

82
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,870
resistance all the stuff we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

83
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,179
ingress and egress filtering out a lot

84
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,100
of security resistance so over time in

85
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,260
operational outage and the thing we had

86
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,609
to do for operational outages with the

87
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,670
different filtering techniques that we

88
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,160
did added more security resistance to

89
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP infrastructure out there right</font>

90
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,030
so the bottom line<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all this as long</font>

91
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,730
as you follow on best common practice

92
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,770
principles out there you're pretty in

93
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,420
pretty good shape alright so that's the

94
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,070
bottom line now trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate</font>

95
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,799
that to all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new people coming into</font>

96
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,750
this that's been been our challenge all

97
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,310
right the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just inherently</font>

98
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,110
from the very beginning the way border

99
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,060
gateway protocol was design you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

100
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">very common sense principles you know</font>

101
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,920
this garden trusts a sort of paradigm

102
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,140
that that we use because you know you

103
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,450
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the prefixes</font>

104
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,179
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into you you put a filter up</font>

105
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,790
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> appearing agreement is is</font>

106
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,650
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> two providers who put up you</font>

107
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,929
know practically two identical filters

108
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,370
to enforce a peer<font color="#CCCCCC"> an agreement you know</font>

109
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,480
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Murphy's Law of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> networking</font>

110
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,030
with one Coulter goes down the other

111
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,590
filter takes over now that as we have

112
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned through operational incidence</font>

113
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,260
say like a 707 incident you know we had

114
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,608
compartment ization on internet there

115
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,070
are some providers who were really

116
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,750
affected by 7007 there are other

117
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,630
providers who they had the like page

118
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">tongues somebody to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

119
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,710
colleagues<font color="#E5E5E5"> out here he told me oh yeah</font>

120
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,389
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other</font>

121
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,030
to tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and it was</font>

122
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,740
going on because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he had very aggressive</font>

123
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,909
filters coming coming into his network

124
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,550
so and we see that with unauthorized

125
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,349
route injection you know incidents out

126
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,050
there was somebody like for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

127
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:46,759
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk of somebody sends in</font>

128
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,229
advertising for a route you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

129
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,520
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that everywhere you only see</font>

130
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:51,590
it in some places so we have

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,150
compartmentalization so this designed

132
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,940
into the protocol from begin and has

133
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,469
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped add resistance to it so</font>

134
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,819
when we just goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is I'm</font>

135
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to quickly walk through what we</font>

136
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,080
presented as the perceived risk and one

137
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,198
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do this now is</font>

138
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,940
in great from the beginning in my past

139
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,060
work with the government I knew that any

140
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,590
material that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would submit into them</font>

141
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,550
they would the touch suicide when

142
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,979
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take it out to the</font>

143
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">public</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so what we did with this is</font>

144
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,639
we decided well you know you kind of

145
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,229
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philip and I we got this ice the</font>

146
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,729
essentials white paper materials you put

147
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,940
out there so we put this as a supplement

148
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:28,219
and copyrighted it and then gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

149
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,530
government permission to use it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I</font>

150
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,840
can present<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here and the rest of</font>

151
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,059
stuff the at the waiting for the fall

152
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,469
all right and and then lead lead into

153
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,599
what's the what's next because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

154
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,090
have some what's next sort of activities

155
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:42,650
going on primarily an ietf and we want

156
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,679
to encourage participation in those what

157
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,630
next sort of activities arm right from

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,610
the beginning I ran into this even even

159
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,919
inside Cisco I had guys inside Cisco

160
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,599
says all it's very easy to spoof PGP you

161
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,669
know school PGP send to reset in and

162
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:58,460
drop the TCP session bgp session goes

163
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:00,049
down like you know it was it was that

164
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,090
easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd probably see a lot more of it</font>

165
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,409
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there why isn't so i go into my tack</font>

166
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,638
11 starts throwing up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> throwing up</font>

167
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:06,469
tasks<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going like this is kind of</font>

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,849
hard why is it hard walk into the

169
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:10,669
developers what's going on here why's it

170
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,259
so hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes comes down to and ike i</font>

171
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,359
was comparing notes at fault rihanna

172
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:17,180
yesterday right so this is kind of like

173
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,919
out there bgp implementations that you

174
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,650
know you got a natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> source address</font>

175
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,320
nasa source port you know hit the match

176
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,210
destination port<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright hit the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tto of</font>

177
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you're ebgp session you got to hit</font>

178
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,440
that TTL you know if you go on with a

179
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,060
TTL of 16 through ebgp session it goes

180
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,460
well i'm looking for a TTL 1 i'll drop

181
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,130
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the</font>

182
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,680
sequence number right to get in there

183
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so that's just to get in so it's</font>

184
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,590
not just spoofing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sequence number</font>

185
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,199
booth on multiple things to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

186
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP process there to get the TCP session</font>

187
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,930
started for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP process right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

188
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:56,789
essentially you need to get in in

189
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:58,770
wiretap right is basically the risk

190
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,150
assessment here and in since there's so

191
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,448
much private peering out there you know

192
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,250
if somebody's wiretapped on a you know

193
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:06,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh c 12 you've got other problems right</font>

194
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,909
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to sit there</font>

195
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,909
as some of these wiretap in OC 12 and

196
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:13,349
hit little bgp reset<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sonia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will probably</font>

197
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,900
do other things right and then there's

198
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,520
md5 but you know we have our deployment

199
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,289
issues that you know we're trying to

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,419
figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work out with md5 so you</font>

201
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:24,300
put any five on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP pure connection</font>

202
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:27,359
and then there's another thing you have

203
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,509
to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spoof now spoofing</font>

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,009
is a prerequisite to do a hijack right

205
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,689
now you get they got sandy Murphy's

206
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,599
anymore if you did a good good breakdown

207
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:39,479
what if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know went in and hijack</font>

208
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,060
the session and did a you know a fake

209
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,909
bgp update into the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> what would</font>

210
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,229
happen you do there so her work<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font>

211
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,370
references at the end of the

212
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,440
presentation you know look through that

213
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,270
it's good good material there but you

214
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,190
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scoop it before you can hijack</font>

215
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so there's a little</font>

216
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:59,069
prerequisite thing going on there so so

217
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:01,229
this rich didn't seem you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a big out</font>

218
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:03,750
there route flap wrap flappin you know

219
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:05,128
what if somebody you know you know took

220
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,659
over router and started flapping lots of

221
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,039
routes well we got Ralph Latin you know

222
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:09,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">we we've been through that we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

223
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,938
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hopefully is the best kind of</font>

224
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,229
practicing people are doing you know

225
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:17,699
right now it's two to nine right so

226
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,650
luckily we had the guys over and right

227
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,169
many years ago said we'll wait a minute

228
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,448
why we listening to cisco's default for

229
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,909
dampening that's dumb let's go through

230
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,469
and do some real<font color="#CCCCCC"> good studies and figure</font>

231
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:30,210
out what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really should do and so we</font>

232
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:32,789
got this work that continues on you know

233
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,588
we this lessons learned so as long as

234
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 to nine you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

235
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:39,690
good the aggregation now the aggregation

236
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,510
comes out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is where we're this</font>

237
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,579
this is actually a valid these next few

238
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,730
things are valid kind of threats that we

239
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:49,500
we do see incidents like this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

240
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,180
why we see it because I'm like Rob Rob

241
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,279
Thomas some of you know Rob Thomas you

242
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,750
know we he's got his templates and

243
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,970
provide good materials Rob and I will

244
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,790
get

245
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,220
the phone and we'll we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> waddle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and our</font>

246
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,110
you know in our paranoia as you know

247
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,240
what could happen to the internet with

248
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,639
people breaking into routers you know

249
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,649
and we got good kind of good

250
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,240
intelligence that there's a lot of cpe

251
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,720
routers out there that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken into</font>

252
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,240
you know the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization who owns</font>

253
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,850
the router you know by contracts right

254
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,370
does not own the router some kid owns

255
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,310
really owns that router an organization

256
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,829
doesn't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right and</font>

257
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,729
thankfully what a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those you know</font>

258
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:29,680
cyberpunks are doing is they're using it

259
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,509
for like you know go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it launched</font>

260
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,250
GRE tunnels to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like you know</font>

261
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,779
obscure where they're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in from</font>

262
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,970
from the real attacks are using as

263
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,250
redirect points but a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

264
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,100
multihomed all right there multi home

265
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,529
routers taking full<font color="#CCCCCC"> btp routes and you</font>

266
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,740
know they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say what can happen if I</font>

267
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:50,680
be aggregate and send it in which is a

268
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,029
you know op 707 was an operational

269
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,008
incident but those sort of things to

270
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,420
happen right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is I call I call</font>

271
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things garbage in garbage out</font>

272
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,199
incidents this is kind of like a problem

273
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we don't have you know wide</font>

bc p38 going on in the package a lot of

282
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,389
ISPs don't bother putting on bgp filters

283
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a multi homeless alright so that</font>

284
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,089
means somebody who takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> over a little</font>

285
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,459
router down there a little router in

286
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:30,519
down there somebody takes over so let me

287
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:32,619
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aggregating let's see what happens</font>

288
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,019
and then the egress filter and going out

289
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,430
to the upstream peers you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

290
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,620
send the garbage out so garbage comes

291
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,269
into an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP garbage goes out to isp and</font>

292
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,129
then you have a situation where you have

293
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:45,269
you know a bunch of but<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub-networks</font>

294
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:48,939
under duress right and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another</font>

295
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:50,860
7007 incident now luckily you know how

296
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,990
you can protect yourself against that is

297
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,279
some sort of ingress Beltran again it's

298
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,600
something like this happened we'd have

299
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">compartmentalization some providers</font>

300
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,980
would be affected other providers won't

301
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,899
so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though this is a valid threat</font>

302
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,639
and we do see this happen every<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and</font>

303
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:07,130
then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to take out the</font>

304
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:10,490
internet right so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's that's</font>

305
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,770
intact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so proper filtering</font>

306
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,050
takes care of this again or best common

307
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,060
practices adds a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of robust Achilles</font>

308
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,650
security to your network and if he

309
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,569
thinks if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent it</font>

310
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,949
is the filter and down on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer</font>

311
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,770
side when you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home customers</font>

312
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:27,320
coming in put those bgp filters on you

313
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:30,290
know only allow specific prefixes that

314
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,060
they are allocated to do and yes it gets

315
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,949
painful sometimes when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple</font>

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,240
sort of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now I Anna I don't</font>

329
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,250
know a lot of people saw this but I

330
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,470
Anna's putting out a document putting

331
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,230
more detailed on the documented stuff of

332
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,560
us addresses so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the iono draft</font>

333
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,840
that's up here and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

334
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,400

338
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,230
template because Rob Thomas makes it

339
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,850
easy you go to his templates and there

340
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,800
is a starting point<font color="#CCCCCC"> that get you start</font>

341
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,020
selling so there's people out there who

342
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,790
made it easy to get started with these

343
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,990
sort of filtering all right um

344
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,939
unauthorized route injection well you're

345
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,350
with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the roots right we've seen</font>

346
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,920
incidences there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen instances</font>

347
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,210
where major content providers you know

348
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,599
you know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes out there takes</font>

349
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,760
over a router injects a major content

350
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,470
provider right and these these sort of

351
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,480
things when they want to authorize when

352
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,730
they send it off of unauthorized route

353
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,710
injection into a network it gets through

354
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,920
the filters they've become a double boss

355
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,200
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the prefix you send in</font>

356
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">there you know traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moves from their</font>

357
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,520
site so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there dost but then traffic</font>

358
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">moves to somebody else and then their</font>

359
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">Doss because sometimes these are big</font>

360
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,430
content providers and you know the

361
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,260
traffic hits them right in everything in

362
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,520
between so it causes stress stress on

363
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,840
the network of these sort of incidence

364
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,770
this

365
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,560
so again Val filtering you know protects

366
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,970
against this okay for unauthorized route

367
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,800
in Jackson Heights we put the same slide

368
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,610
up there to show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again bull gone</font>

369
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,650
risk now boog on filtering you know

370
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">people say whom should i do bulldog</font>

371
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,430
filter or not sell our ball gowns go out

372
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,380
if if somebody can break into a router

373
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,479
and send out a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bull gonz right</font>

374
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,970
and the bow guards go out what happens

375
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,460
well look at script kiddie tools out

376
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,210
there script kiddie tools you know to

377
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:54,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">keep the source obscure commonly use</font>

378
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,800
bogan addresses all right Vogons are the

379
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,230
addresses that we have not yet allocated

380
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,510
out to the internet right and they use

381
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vogon addresses as a source right you</font>

382
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,090
know if they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been allocated</font>

383
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,710
internet they're not in the route table

384
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,420
you can't get back to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

385
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,980
do a trace back so you got lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

386
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,479
script kiddie tools that people download

387
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,150
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ircs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get mad at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

388
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,390
and they throw at it they hit right now

389
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,939
when you drop a packet you send icmp

390
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,370
unreachable back that's backscatter now

391
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,010
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertise vogue on space what</font>

392
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,450
happens well now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a route</font>

393
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright and all these script kiddies are</font>

394
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,300
constantly going because we know we have

395
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,400
all these script kiddies constantly

396
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,140
doing attacks all this does<font color="#CCCCCC"> late</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

397
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">latency backscatter all sudden that's</font>

398
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,870
getting dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all these different</font>

399
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,210
routers also and wakes up and goes oh

400
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,220
let's go you know go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point and</font>

401
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,740
you become a vacuum sucking all this

402
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,230
back scatter into you boom yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

403
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,640
right so even even filtering on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Logans</font>

404
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,640
you need to consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because with</font>

405
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,920
all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-level script kiddie attacks</font>

406
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,939
going on in at all time using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bogan</font>

407
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:58,780
space it can hurt you right so something

408
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,550
something to consider on that right most

409
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,920
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time i get called in like you</font>

410
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,079
know I'm kind of attached with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font>

411
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,760
or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consist of our security reaction</font>

412
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,740
team and they'll call me up or certain

413
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,270
call me up<font color="#CCCCCC"> say hey this this providers</font>

414
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,270
under attack something's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

415
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,250
and most of time to say all bgp is under

416
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,260
attack because they're hitting port 179

417
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,290
when you dig into it most of those

418
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,330
attacks are not bgp attacks because it's

419
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">very hard to spoof they don't even a lot</font>

420
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,700
of times they don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get down to</font>

421
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:29,920
accept on the tcp stack but they do hit

422
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,690
and they do hurt because what happens is

423
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">their resource saturation attacks</font>

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,150
saturation and this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

435
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,699
hope all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you who are vendors out</font>

436
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,069
there all vendors should be out there

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,260
resistance into their gear for these

439
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,670
sort of attacks because this is the big

440
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,770
attack vector going after after

441
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,719

442
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TAS and there is like</font>

you got a forward in<font color="#CCCCCC"> nasik you know as</font>

the cpu 2 supports the foreign nasik if

446
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,199
you plug into a backplane the backplane

447
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,550
can be saturated input buffers can be

448
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,320
saturate there's a lot of saturation

449
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,140
point so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go after a piece of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is probably probably fifty percent</font>

doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this now this is a well known</font>

456
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:43,810
threat and my customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all telling</font>

457
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:47,140
me that we've got to do this okay summer

458
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:50,140
2001 architecture architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect</font>

459
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:53,620
security summer 2001 we have code red

460
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:56,110
ninja<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay encoder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ninda was was really</font>

461
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,910
interested because you know oh it

462
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,740
doesn't affect ISPs it's like hitting a

463
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of in host but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually hit a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

464
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,520
ISPs the reason why there was a bunch of

465
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,630
ISPs out there who are running default

466
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,300
right now default<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a</font>

467
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,949
Code Red<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Linda magnet you know it</font>

468
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,629
says because code ran Linda the way to

469
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,980
algorithm work it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just working all</font>

470
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,660
over the different address space and

471
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,370
it's little algorithm each each one had

472
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jump in algorithm</font>

473
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,579
you know and it would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

474
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,709
looking for things and a lot of times is

475
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,480
hidden<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vogon station to other things</font>

476
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,430
well you know if you run in default you

477
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,740
suck everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> who says I'm default</font>

478
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,900
come to me and you had you know as a

479
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,120
router sitting on a transoceanic gateway

480
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,400
and then you know send all code red

481
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,870
traffic to me you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm</font>

482
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drop at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> null 0 will send it</font>

483
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,750
all to me and the router you know cuz

484
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,270
those goes down the tubes

485
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,290
so the architecture relates<font color="#E5E5E5"> us right</font>

486
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,320
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this look at the</font>

487
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:52,139
architecture security bugs have been

488
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,480
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary out there all right but</font>

489
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,450
luckily with the security bugs we catch

490
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,970
them in time so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know by the time</font>

491
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,070
does the the hacker community says oh

492
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:05,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">wow this looks like interest and exploit</font>

493
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,510
vector the operators<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

494
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,460
vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> of operators have already</font>

495
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,160
patched it and got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you know catch</font>

496
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,750
up on a network what is scary though is

497
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,510
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting more and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

498
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:19,050
inner compatibility issues you know we

499
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,300
in those of you who are dual vendor you

500
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,710
know operators out there you basically

501
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're to test that today in the old</font>

502
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,760
days maybe two you know five ten years

503
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago there were actually events where we</font>

504
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,200
actually had competitor routers come

505
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,690
together and they would interoperate you

506
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,730
know not operationally off on a net but

507
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is broken down and</font>

508
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,820
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the feedback we gave to</font>

509
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government that can be helped</font>

510
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,080
with right so that to get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know two</font>

511
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,120
operators together three operators for

512
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,889
operators anybody who speaks bgp to make

513
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,750
sure they speak in BGP with each other

514
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:52,710
properly and not how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test it on</font>

515
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:54,780
operational<font color="#CCCCCC"> network community attacks</font>

516
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,130
this would just threw out there because

517
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">we haven't thought of really any</font>

518
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,810
community based attacks but as you saw

519
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,660
the presentation yesterday on you know

520
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,310
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know inflation where lots</font>

521
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,320
and lots of community you know prefixes

522
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,629
or communities on it you know do happen

523
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know it could be people poking</font>

524
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:14,190
around with what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do is add in lots</font>

525
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,420
and lots of communities lad and lots and

526
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,450
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and communities you already know</font>

527
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,800
takes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of memory</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so already</font>

528
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">cuz already consumes memory comes</font>

529
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,659
consumes memory on every router down the

530
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:27,600
path right so that's something to think

531
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,890
about we know how I don't think there's

532
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,050
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people out there doing</font>

533
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,160
community ingress filtering you know a

534
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people haven't thought about that</font>

535
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I think after some of the stuff is</font>

536
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented yesterday and thinking about</font>

537
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">security people may want to go down that</font>

538
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,490
path and explore that that having to

539
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,139
whether it's worthwhile to do community

540
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,160
based filter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> King dressed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into your</font>

541
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,780
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what's next um you know</font>

542
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,200
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of some of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

543
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,670
what's what's next<font color="#E5E5E5"> right ipsec</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

544
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,530
this a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> say i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

545
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,750
bgp over ipsec but

546
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,620
I go what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you gain right there's a</font>

547
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,390
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying what are you</font>

548
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,040
getting right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of interesting</font>

549
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,760
idea but what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain you know if</font>

550
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,889
it's very hard to spoof and in hijack a

551
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,200
BGP session then what's the ipsec give

552
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,580
you I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know keep people from</font>

553
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,530
wiretapping but if somebody's wife

554
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">tapping to get other problems maybe your</font>

555
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,580
resources to be spent somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

556
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">so ipsec but people are looking at that</font>

557
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:25,350
right so we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out</font>

558
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright s bgp right now spdt has been</font>

559
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:32,689
controversial right and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

560
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,160
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually you know if</font>

561
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,890
anybody has read it before go back and

562
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,290
reread it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything the work</font>

563
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,930
for all the s<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp work has put together</font>

564
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,520
some good articulation about the other

565
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,050
problems with authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

566
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,240
authenticating the source of the

567
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,190
advertisement coming to network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

568
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,590
there's a bunch of areas that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were kind</font>

569
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,750
of exposed with that we have you know

570
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,730
some sums we have some issues there that

571
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,260
they've got it all documented well

572
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,840
together and there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been some changes</font>

573
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,340
of SB GPS am involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing testing</font>

574
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,860
with this so if you have not read it

575
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">before go and read it if you read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

576
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,590
the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like a year ago so go back</font>

577
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,840
and reread it it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be passed into RP</font>

578
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,129
sex right so we taking that work in

579
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,840
there for people to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

580
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,030
that and considering with it and this is

581
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,939
a URL if you don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URL to</font>

582
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,129
get all the information for SBT p all

583
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,750
right toe mine people say well pull my

584
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,280
insecurities well<font color="#E5E5E5"> mines working on</font>

585
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,440
something else let's see no<font color="#E5E5E5"> mines</font>

586
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,430
working on filtering all right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

587
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,590
working on your ingress and egress

588
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,990
filtering working on keeping our table

589
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,879
down but as we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of filter</font>

590
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,800
and what that's going to result in as

591
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">work from toll mine comes out and we</font>

592
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,230
start figuring out exactly here's what

593
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,750
we're going to do in pairs what we're

594
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,310
going to deploy that is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

595
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,480
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> security resistance because it's</font>

596
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:48,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep people from playing other</font>

597
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,330
games with you know better route filters

598
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,220
out there right so so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on</font>

599
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,220
until mine this would be a good

600
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,890
operators which to be on now RP sec just

601
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,090
starting up just getting charted on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

602
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,950
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first working group meeting is</font>

603
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in Yokohama and this is kind</font>

604
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,320
of like working through the assumption

605
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,960
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at our you know</font>

606
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,120
protocol security what you know even

607
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,590
classifying do we have a problem right

608
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,870
so some of the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is going to be</font>

609
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,120
do we really have a problem and what do

610
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,459
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do with it so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font>

611
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,870
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the key what next that</font>

612
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,960
we'd like to get active<font color="#E5E5E5"> participation</font>

613
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,549
from operators right it's not good to

614
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,529
have an ietf working group where you

615
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,539
have a bunch of vendors sitting there

616
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,279
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's dangerous you want</font>

617
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:34,129
operators in these sort of meetings

618
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,269
because it affects what is is done and

619
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> results and everything so we're</font>

620
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:41,240
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for to get more operators into</font>

621
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:44,330
the RP sec efforts<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then a new</font>

622
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,120
ones popping up right and and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

623
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,799
are this email address kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of email</font>

624
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,049
email to me actually if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

625
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">information on this in working with</font>

626
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:55,610
sands and unit and some other

627
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,320
individuals from digital island<font color="#E5E5E5"> exodus</font>

628
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:00,918
and ever everything we realize that

629
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">routers themselves needed to have more</font>

630
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:06,950
robust security requirements so you can

631
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,120
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it consistent because unit was</font>

632
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,250
always getting frustrated because you

633
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,559
see vendor a bender be vendor fee and

634
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,559
they're not consistent across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three</font>

635
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,059
on how they do a CLS or how they do

636
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,700
logins and it or get extremely

637
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:22,399
frustrated with that so so they started

638
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a requirements and and then in</font>

639
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:26,000
consultation with with them you know

640
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:28,820
we're saying why don't we do a

641
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,309
supplement to RFC 1812 this is this row

642
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,408
19 18 should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 12 which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

643
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,480
router requirements document alright so

644
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:37,429
the router requirements document for IP

645
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,080
version 4 is out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

646
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:41,480
router vendors use that to say this is

647
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,000
what my router should do you know I get

648
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,889
an ICMP and I drop the packet you know

649
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,450
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the things i should do like</font>

650
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:49,129
packet comes in i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no route this</font>

651
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,620
about us to do right so that that work

652
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:53,090
went on years ago and we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

653
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:55,100
supplement that with security

654
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,779
requirements what should you expect that

655
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">every single product that comes in your</font>

656
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:01,639
door from security standpoint so if

657
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,019
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this just email</font>

658
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:05,389
this alias because it will go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> george</font>

659
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:06,769
stones or email me and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

660
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:09,320
start up an alias around it there's

661
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:10,850
already a draft so we got to draft so so

662
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,320
we got something to work with and we

663
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,789
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided whether to take it as an</font>

664
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,928
informational RFC or to take it as a

665
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:16,429
working group that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like a</font>

666
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:17,830
consensus sort of thing of what people

667
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,960
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

668
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgement um we got the</font>

669
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,140
white paper out there you can download a

670
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,360
look at what we submitted in and

671
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,700
relevant with all these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

672
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,260
write this together I<font color="#E5E5E5"> volunteered to be</font>

673
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,150
attitude to put it all together and

674
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,860
write write the work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

675
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,370
collective<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of sort of effort that</font>

676
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">we put into it and then we have URLs and</font>

677
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,419
references so you can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look</font>

678
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,240
at stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then as we come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

679
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,770
updates you know I'll push them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

680
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sites</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Nano</font>

681
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:51,010
excite or archives that I don't most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

682
00:24:48,860 --> 00:25:01,939
my white papers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bus stuff out there</font>

683
00:24:51,010 --> 00:25:04,550
okay so uh any questions in Sandy's risk

684
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:08,090
assessment or even other risk

685
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:10,909
assessments they have had one problem is

686
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,429
the host security<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just last</font>

687
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:16,370
covered i believe of the router you know

688
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:20,120
the fact that it costs so much to get

689
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:22,310
ssh for some edge routers that they

690
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,830
don't pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it may I don't want even</font>

691
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:27,669
secure shell because people charged me

692
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,870
that much more on how much is security

693
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,880
willing to do so there's the router

694
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,209
security either by<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost or by</font>

695
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,220
availability of software and what I

696
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,190
thought your answer was is it's good

697
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,900
enough is that the summation of your

698
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,330
answer or that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on</font>

699
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,570
it as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as router requirements to make</font>

700
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,310
sure we have even the tank oh it's on

701
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,889
sale it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely not good enough I</font>

702
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,840
mean if you be going to copy the drop

703
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,210
you will find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are so many</font>

704
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,610
things that Cisco is not consistent with

705
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,960
yet when it comes to router security

706
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,929
stuff and that's probably that's one of

707
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,130
my Kiki jobs in my company but we're

708
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,920
trying to do is get consistent across

709
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:09,770
but on a cpe side I know back when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

710
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,690
an operator and this is like back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 96</font>

711
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,460
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my aggregation</font>

712
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,960
routers and turn on CDP collect the

713
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,580
world my<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers horror find out all the</font>

714
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,430
cisco ones and set up a little script

715
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,560
and found out you know thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of</font>

716
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,360
the routers connected to that one

00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:39,830
a disparity all the way through or but

724
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,960
do in clear text could make it even more

725
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,269
fun I mean that's you know straight down

726
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,470
into the router to make life interesting

727
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:50,570
yeah so you're you're working through

728
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,960
the router<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements saying do better</font>

729
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:56,870
security as a host right another portion

730
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,659
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandy's data you talked about which</font>

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:03,219
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok now I'm in this insecure place and</font>

732
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:07,070

to the net and what I think I heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">say is suddenly the ice all the</font>

735
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:15,200
providers have done significant amount

736
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,509
of filtering so that an injected bad

737
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,029
prefix can't swim through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net and do</font>

738
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:22,899
bad things is that what I understood

739
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:26,119
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nightly what on</font>

740
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:28,758
many providers do it so its compartment

741
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:31,789
eyes but my experience is that the

742
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,769
filtering on the customer edge is a weak

743
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:36,139
area one of the key weak areas just like

744
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:37,340
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> BC p38 with packet filter and</font>

745
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:40,158
source you know so i think that

746
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,899
occasionally agent network we have the

747
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,909
same problem on the outside with

748
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:48,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-home multi loan providers so that</font>

749
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:51,139
as a minimum that comes into the first

750
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,928
step is p then there's a next stage

751
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:56,119
where where many many of the ISPs I've

752
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:58,129
seen around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world are not doing the</font>

753
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,990
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do egress filtering going</font>

754
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:01,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">out that appears right so now checking</font>

755
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,700
what's going out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have garbage in</font>

756
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:09,139

757
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,820
garbage in garbage out and even though

758
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:12,498
we have filters and lots of good<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

759
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,100
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't really instantiated those</font>

760
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:18,619
filters and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places if that's the</font>

761
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,158
summation no whitewashing know anything

762
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:24,408
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still free and yet you say it's</font>

763
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:26,450
good enough security I wondered why you

764
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:29,330
made that when we still have plenty of

765
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,909
holes for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP structure to come in</font>

766
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,529
and then I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know why where you</font>

767
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:36,499
thought the access list would improve

768
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:40,789
that I'm not I'm not downgrading and i

769
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:42,470
truly lawd all your work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Sandy's working all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term work</font>

771
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,430
of everyone but I'm

772
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,900
a little confused by how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make</font>

773
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,880
the statement it's good enough when

774
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,140
there's significant what's all good

775
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,300
enough from the context that we're not

776
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have the net fall over one cpu</font>

777
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,610
router sending a you know bogus prefix

778
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,140
in there you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have providers</font>

779
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,610
out there with the way they<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up the</font>

780
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,890
filter is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow that prefix</font>

781
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,110
into their network does it go to you

782
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,460
know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the filters</font>

783
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,050
you believe that the filters are

784
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,120
substantial enough that there are

785
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,500
firewalls at some places in the net

786
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:16,030
right so you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

787
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:18,280
Internet why'd you know there's no this

788
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,540
through through experience from seeing

789
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,980
these for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> incidents and into this</font>

790
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,500
dive work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

791
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,020
somebody inject a content providers

792
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,320
prefix in a more specific they send in a

793
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,150
/ 30<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you know it gets it starts</font>

794
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,100
sucking in the traffic but that's last

795
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:36,250
audio zone is only goes to two other

796
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,780
ISPs right and in some cases doesn't

797
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,750
even go to the end provider it's just

798
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,370
right so its compartment eyes which it

799
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,410
she can do not have a network line

800
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,540
failure but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you shins can see hijacking</font>

801
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,770
of individual prefixes based on how good

802
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,050
the filters are around that particular

803
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,310
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix and because we know filter</font>

804
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,230
and works of that we know we can

805
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,210
compartment eyes it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font>

806
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,370
through and start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how your</font>

807
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,590
filter and policy is set up you can

808
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:01,419
mitigate a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more can</font>

809
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,070
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the tools we already</font>

810
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,020
have available till tears and then

811
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,000
indeed as part of my questioning that it

812
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,710
didn't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave out that we you</font>

813
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,990
know should we use the tools we already

814
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,650
have yeah you might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better that's</font>

815
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:17,770
the next sequence of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sandy's</font>

820
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:32,650
with my feel like you said a letter with

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:35,170
a seal<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it I didn't notice any of that</font>

didn't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down that path and I wondered</font>

825
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,730
why you didn't go down that path while

826
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,000
pointing toward<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edge speech if you</font>

827
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:49,570
work um I kind of relate those as

828
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,040
similar in a sense and i wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

829
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,280
people more to our pset because i think

830
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to probably view</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sandy's</font>

831
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,930
work you the SBT p work and

832
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:02,860
really look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what's operationally</font>

833
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:04,870
feasible looking at both of those and

834
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,030
going to customers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is this</font>

835
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,830
stuff that we should do like any coding

836
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:10,570
stuff they come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well how</font>

837
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,399
are we going to deploy it you know we

838
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,659
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of work to do on both sides so</font>

839
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,180
how to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out are we really going to</font>

840
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,280
deploy it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I mean in 9000 we've had</font>

841
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,660
two or three presentations from SP GP

842
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,940
and the last I've checked with them they

843
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,410
haven't made substantial forward motion

844
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,210
on that and that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still a lot of</font>

845
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,360
computational although it's a terrific

846
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:29,830
ideas the computational requirements in

847
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,919
that have been significant and I just

848
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,379
are you telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the SPG p stuff</font>

849
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,710
is taken a computational<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they're</font>

850
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,570
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> caching path IDs or security</font>

851
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,880
ideas have they gone forward with that

852
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,919
that hasn't that hasn't changed but what

853
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,130
I mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this audience</font>

854
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,900
everybody is in those meeting an idea so

855
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:53,200
one of the things I'm trying to do here

856
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:56,110

871
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,250
it wouldn't take it so well with a 10

877
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:51,639
inside I go it's situational right

878
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:56,110
situation well if you take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sig</font>

00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,610
this is a valid TCP session you've done

00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:27,410
a successful spoof<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right then we got</font>

related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the syn flood protections</font>

893
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,270
that we you can see on unix boxes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">guess by your kind of fuzziness there</font>

895
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,879
