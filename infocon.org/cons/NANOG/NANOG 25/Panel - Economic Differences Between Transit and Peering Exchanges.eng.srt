00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:15,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we are going to be talking a</font>

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:19,380
little bit about trends in internet

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:23,340
exchanges specifically looking at the

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:34,399
differences between exchanges that seem

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:37,680
to be exchanges that seem to be passing

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly or exclusively peering graphic</font>

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,129
and ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are passing mostly are</font>

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,110
exclusively or sorry once they're

9
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,260
passing a significant amount of transit

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,379
traffic and how that's causing or maybe

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,910
causing a divergence in a number of

12
00:00:52,379 --> 00:01:00,089
characteristics of different kinds of

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:05,539
exchanges so with me up here to discuss

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:09,630
this I have Keith Mitchell who actually

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:14,760
both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the jump up here helped start</font>

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,360
links for some time so Smith has been

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,970
the place so for those of you want to

22
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of follow along with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> points</font>

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,700
each of the three of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be</font>

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:48,180
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover in this discussion there</font>

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:26,100
commentary from you guys the two pieces

35
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:29,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">of sort of old accepted wisdom that I</font>

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,290
think need to be re-examined our first

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,720
of all that exchanges are functionally

38
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,970
similar that basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> an exchange is an</font>

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,770
exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they may be sort of</font>

40
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,780
qualitatively different like this one is

41
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,620
a good one this one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad one this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,150
a small one this one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large one but</font>

43
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,140
that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all doing the same thing</font>

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,180
and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's true anymore</font>

45
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,458
the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people by</font>

46
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,380
transit at their own location that is

47
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,810
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you buy friends that somebody</font>

48
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:02,459
delivers a circuit to your office or

49
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:08,700
your pop or whatever and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

50
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:10,830
going to exchanges to peer but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,250
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really happening in the</font>

52
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,989
world there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some exchanges that seem</font>

53
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,209
to be priced very differently<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

54
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:22,260
others some<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very expensive some are</font>

55
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:25,590
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap there are a lot of exchanges</font>

56
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,590
that are free right that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost to</font>

57
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,769
a participant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and put in a router</font>

58
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:36,420
and get a 100 Meg port or a gig port or

59
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:38,100
whatever is zero dollars per month real

60
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,048
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course nothing is ever exactly</font>

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">free right things that appeared to be</font>

62
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:47,459
free or<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsidized somehow but and</font>

63
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,739
that's the case here but the fact that

64
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,049
they have zero dollar cost to the

65
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:57,090
participants is is nevertheless the case

66
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:59,549
at the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanges</font>

67
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost more than ten thousand dollars</font>

68
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,269
a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> that once it costs more than</font>

69
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,549
fifteen thousand dollars a month to go

70
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:13,170
to and have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred mega gigabit port</font>

71
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:16,289
and in many cases these exchanges are

72
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:20,680
very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> size right there are free</font>

73
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:22,330
exchanges and $15,000 month<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchanges or</font>

74
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,180
free exchanges are larger or perhaps

75
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:29,440
more traffic or have more participants

76
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:33,340
or you know by any measure our larger

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,750
exchanges um so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:40,330
correlation there at all um the other

79
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is that although historically was</font>

80
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,729
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> common for exchanges to have a rule</font>

81
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,469
that said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no passing of transit traffic</font>

82
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,919
across the switch are no passion of

83
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,949
transit traffic through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exchange no</font>

84
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,810
but still in effect so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font>

85
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,490
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common someone will go to an</font>

86
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,520
exchange in there they'll buy or sell

87
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:05,669
transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that either in addition to</font>

88
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,669
appearing or to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exclusion of caring</font>

89
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:15,360
so my hypothesis but that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

90
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:19,599
discuss here is that there are two poles

91
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,250
on a continuum right that there are you

92
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,800
could hypothetically have an exchange

93
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're only peering occurs and you could</font>

94
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,150
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an exchange where only transit</font>

95
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,490
is bought and sold<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there isn't any</font>

96
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">peering and then in point of fact there</font>

97
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,620
are a fair number of exchanges towards

98
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:37,330
the ends of of this continuum that there

99
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,280
are a fair number of exchanges there are

100
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,500
maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred percent peering or a</font>

101
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred percent transit but are fairly</font>

102
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,130
close to that on one side<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather and</font>

103
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:52,169
that it may be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make an</font>

104
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:55,060
exchange that<font color="#E5E5E5"> serves both communities</font>

105
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,740
optimally it may be much easier to sort

106
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,710
of focus on one market or the other

107
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,830
market and serve the needs of people

108
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:06,479
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> either transit or appearing but it</font>

109
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:13,740
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to find a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good middle ground</font>

110
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:16,479
so my my analysis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this follows and I</font>

111
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,300
guess explicitly interrupting<font color="#E5E5E5"> arguing</font>

112
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:24,139
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

113
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:25,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right okay so and some of these</font>

114
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,289
things there are maybe a little bit

115
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:31,490
controversial but you'll see where it's

116
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:33,409
going controversial statement number one

117
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,300
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that redundancy has never needed a</font>

118
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:38,300
non appearing path right the whole point

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,490
of peering is to be redundant with your

120
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,590
transit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so some of you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

121
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,470
say oh but only those people who aren't

122
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:50,619
tier ones by transit of course that's

123
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:53,300
nearly everybody so statistically it's

124
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,500
enough of everybody that it's the way

125
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,590
the world works um the peering is there

126
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,740
is an economic optimization on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre</font>

127
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:07,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing transit routes so there's no</font>

128
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:11,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason to pay more for peering than you</font>

129
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,949
would lose if you're appearing

130
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:17,448
connection went down briefly right that

131
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:20,060
is you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to pay for reliability</font>

132
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,099
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing connection because you've</font>

133
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">already got the reliability through your</font>

134
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,710
transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of the peering is to</font>

135
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:33,289
be cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to move the bits more</font>

136
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:36,109
cheaply than the transit would so so

137
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:38,750
aggregation benefit right glomming a lot

138
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,699
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> together into one place in</font>

139
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,289
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a single big circuit</font>

140
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,990
that's less expensive than a whole lot

141
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,870
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> little ones would use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in peering</font>

142
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,879
that is you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving up redundancy</font>

143
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,610
you're not giving up reliability that

144
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you care about and you are reducing the</font>

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,150
aggregation benefits work really well in

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,580
peering and getting everything together

148
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:05,318
in one place one big potential point of

<font color="#CCCCCC">the real world you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be buying</font>

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,780
more providers so those that requires

161
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,640
redundancy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to be</font>

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,430
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay a</font>

differences between maximizing

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,660
aggregation benefit implies that in

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,750
appearing exchange you only want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a region whatever region means to</font>

them all with one expenditure keep that

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,520
three or more participants there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

three<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more to have basically to have</font>

186
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:49,660
a market environment operating so the

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,239
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ideal minimum case for transit</font>

beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't care too much</font>

191
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,319
having one is not as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as having to</font>

192
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,960
wear as with the peering strange having

193
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,220
one is much much better than having two

194
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,339
so kind of opposite forces at work there

195
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:16,180
um switch fabrics are also a different

00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">case um in appearing strange if there</font>

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,380

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">connected together at layer 2 so you can</font>

peer with everybody using only<font color="#E5E5E5"> your one</font>

201
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,300
piece of equipment right so you don't

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,370
have to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of each of</font>

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,399
and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full benefit whereas a</font>

206
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,579
transit exchange you want to minimize

207
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,139
risk so you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to two</font>

208
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,939
exchanges and you don't want those two

209
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,440
exchanges to connect there's good fabric

210
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,199
together away or two because if they did

211
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:52,889
one problem might be likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to affect</font>

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:54,870
both of them price-wise<font color="#CCCCCC"> appearing</font>

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,339
better cheaper is always better that's

215
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,800
why there's so much market force in

216
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,899
favor of slightly subsidized ones that

217
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,609
cost participant zero dollars or say

218
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:11,190
under a hundred dollars a month which

219
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:14,850
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are also so the bounding on</font>

220
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:18,899
that price is that it's no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

221
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:22,319
doing if it costs more than it would

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:26,730
cost to ship the peering traffic through

223

transit during an outage<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so if</font>

you're figuring that a low reliable low

227
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,949

your transit for 30 minutes a month is

right as long as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford that you</font>

00:11:51,510 --> 00:12:03,500
in the caring point on the transit side

233
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:06,449
though what is bounding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost is the</font>

234
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,310
the difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what costs to do</font>

it in exchange and what it costs to do

236
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,510
if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back hauled into your own</font>

just call up the transit provider order

a circuit to your pop your vocation

240
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:23,699
whatever and you know do that twice have

241
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,850
to transit providers bring it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

242
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:29,008
alternatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get circuits of</font>

243
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,880
your own out to exchange points and<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font>

244
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:36,120
at the exchange points the advantage of

245
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,279
mine the exchange point is that there is

246
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,189
market fluidity there which is driving

247
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,720
prices down to market rapes as opposed

248
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:44,949
to the premium that you pay

249
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,889
for having<font color="#E5E5E5"> it delivered your own</font>

250
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:49,719
location because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the provider knows once</font>

251
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,610
it's been installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your location</font>

252
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">they've got you for a term contract blah</font>

253
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,769
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

inflexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the contract and they they</font>

255
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:01,779
can extract<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat more from you at</font>

256
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:05,529
that point so that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

257
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:09,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost that transit exchanges in</font>

258
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:11,529
charge so in the real world we look at

259
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,480
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say the transit exchanges can</font>

260
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:16,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty routinely charge ten thousand</font>

262
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:22,360
go and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know by transit from several</font>

263
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,359
providers at good rates at high speeds

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,730
and in reliable facility where as

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,110
appearing exchange even the really big

266
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:34,000
ones um have difficulty justifying

267
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,269
prices of over a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred dollars a</font>

00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:42,699
hundred dollars a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> $50 month</font>

270
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,860
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very few get up into the</font>

271
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:48,250
fifteen hundred dollars a month and

272
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,819
they're a tiny number that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

273
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,170
of serve both functions and are

274
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:56,529
important enough globally that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

275
00:13:53,170 --> 00:14:01,110
charge up in the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> region as the more</font>

276
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:03,550
transit oriented exchanges but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

277
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,540
think both my compatriots here will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

278
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,750
a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more to say about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that than I do</font>

279
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:14,230
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was it for my slide sets well of</font>

280
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:20,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">course have discussion after the three</font>

281
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,100
slide sets and yeah those up next

282
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:38,990
like the a few slides that I've got here

283
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,809
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going over what's kind of</font>

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,180
happening in the asia-pacific region<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

285
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:47,120
I think they add a little bit more to

286
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bills suggestion suggesting about</font>

287
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,939
how exchange points in general are

heading at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope to do my</font>

291
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:02,779
group so I've had some experience in the

region working with some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

294
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:11,839
many of the countries still have no

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,970
exchange points at all in fact the US or

296
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,639
Europe or Europe is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exchange point</font>

297
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,350
for these countries which is for a bit

298
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,740
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bizarre situation for most of the</font>

299
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:24,220
audience here but it's very real in our

300
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,660
region those countries which have

301
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,029
exchanges tend to have two types they

302
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,300
have the neutral exchange which a lot of

303
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:34,309
us will from the past all they have this

304
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,889
commercial exchange which is probably in

305
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:39,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">your thing and there's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> closer</font>

306
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:41,749
to the transit exchange concept that

307
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,939
bills just mentioned now it's called

308
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:46,100
this either a marketing exchange point

309
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:47,679
where basically if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telco or a</font>

try and market my services because it's

313
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:57,139
cool that's generally what they do it's

314
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,300
basically just a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plans of</font>

I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

they don't realize the economic

lately has improved lots more customers

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,059
they also believe that an exchange

351
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,610
points very complicated because we hear

the apricot conference which is sort of

equivalent to nanog and various

439
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:37,249
basically summarizing some of my

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,439
thoughts around this topic it's been a

441
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:41,029
topic that some fairly close<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hearts</font>

445
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:51,470
operator is that i don't too much care

446
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:53,840
about the commercial arrangements

447

between the participants at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchange</font>

448
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,408
whether these appearing agreements or

transit agreements or something else

00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:09,289
which that's achieved is something that

<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't actually have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these strong views</font>

it's fair to say that there are very few

00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:41,810
exchanges that are pure transit or pure

peering

492
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:48,129
there will always be a mixture and I

493
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:50,840
don't see appearing in transit as being

494
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,420

I think it's also fairly well understood

but there are actually some some strong

impetus to do that i mentioned that i

526

thought that peering in transit were a

simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> black-and-white</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's already</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">want resilience but not at the expense</font>

582
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,399
of complexity do you want to use transit

583
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,780
brokers aggregators do they have a

584
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,030
stable future do your conventional

585
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,590
transit providers of a stable future how

586
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,440
do you avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting locked in how easy</font>

587
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,970
is it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change your providers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

588
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,860
basically what everyone's looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

589
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,660
flexibility and it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that</font>

590
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,320
transit exchanges are potentially one of

591
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:38,570
the ways of giving you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that flexibility</font>

592
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,939
so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of differentiation between</font>

593
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,850
why we call a pure appearing point on a

00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,080
pure transit point I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some of the</font>

595
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,179
important points of the traditional

596
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,889
peering points do not in general offer s

599
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,820
cleanser and you're using the transit

600
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,889
exchange is one of the vehicles to

601
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,120
deliver service to your customers you're

604
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:06,560
backed up by the transit exchange one of

605
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,760
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are some of</font>

606
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,240
the traditional peering points like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is too</font>

608
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,260
three in Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do this actually</font>

609
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:16,820
explicitly prohibit transit so they said

610
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:18,110
we are a pure peering point and there

611
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,629
was a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that nearly made plans</font>

612
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:23,178
but the difficulty I have is first of

613
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">all how enough to enforce that I've yet</font>

614
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:30,770
to see a network monitoring tool that

615
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:32,240
measures cash flow and why<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly is it</font>

616
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,710
so evil to do transit across the

617
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,530
exchange in the first place what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

618
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,990
rationale it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me how you</font>

619
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,610
do either of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I think</font>

620
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">another important thing is that there is</font>

621
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:47,090
a distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between a transit point</font>

622
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:49,240
and the bandwidth broker to me the

623
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,889
bandwidth brokers are actually buying

624
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,170
cleanser in and selling out again their

625
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:56,960
transit resellers they become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

626
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:59,840
principal and the contract the transit

627
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,340
points cleanser exchanges are

628
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,980
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> just acting as its silicate</font>

629
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">ER they're bringing the parties together</font>

630
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,830
under providing the physical

631
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:08,660
interconnection capacity between them

632
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,580
but they're not actually involved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

633
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,330
commercial details of the peering

634

arrangement or the transit contract and

635
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,600
I think something that quite important

636
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,669
in this of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of differentiation</font>

637
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,860
discussions there's also differentiation

638
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,550
in terms of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transit offerings the</font>

639
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,840
bandwidth broker philosophy has been the

00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,490
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more differentiation except in</font>

price it's a commodity let's climb the

642
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:33,290
price time as far as we can I think the

643
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,178
reality of the way that most<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest bees</font>

operate and sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> a transit is that there</font>

that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting things is</font>

to facilitate transit simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff like</font>

654
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,780
making contact details available if you

points if you want to facilitate transit

659
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:14,390
well it's probably a matter of promoting

660
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,830
the sales contacts but you can also make

661

sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you publish peering policy</font>

in transit points but it's by no means a

pure thing some of these advantages also

688
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,280
flies to exchanges to appearing

00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,530

necessarily completely odds whispering

peering across the same exchange and

694
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:48,250
that's that's basically summary of my

695
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,250
thoughts at this point

696
00:31:50,659 --> 00:32:05,299
I think I'll try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little bit of</font>

697
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:08,470
discussion on this by prompting things

00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:12,379
with a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions first of all we've</font>

699
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:14,960
we've been summarizing very likely here

700
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:18,759
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thought in this area and</font>

701

we may not have really gotten across the

00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:25,549
the big picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where i think we</font>

703
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:28,940
probably all think things are going with

with services transit services provided

705

the exchanges and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

706

785
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,760
one of the things that exchange

787
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,980
annihilate the distance between all the

788
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:27,930

789

that kind of takes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look all depart the</font>

796
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:50,070
then in a sense that becomes a virtual

797
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:54,720
local loop and I don't think the vast

798

necessarily a bad thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it turned to</font>

the area but well if you've got an

801

number of circuits for the telcos cell

803

that you can sell to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the caller</font>

into one and then usually the exchange

with like the local<font color="#CCCCCC"> tail that's</font>

together on the same switch fabric

820
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,470
that's that's more of a phenomenon

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to send Cole provider having</font>

everybody came to access the same

exchanges as opposed to bandwidth focus

842
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:48,990

your bandwidth broker will be taking

some margin percentage of the actual

00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:00,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">similarities of course are things like</font>

866
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:05,520
tools to provide the compare the transit

867
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:08,640
offerings there's really no reason why

868
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,140
these can't be provided just as much of

869
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,000
a transit exchange operators are

870
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,560
endearing exchange operators you can use

871
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,099
the same tools to make peering decisions

872
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,790
as you can to make climate decisions to

873
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:23,210
a large degree arm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that turn</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font>

875
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:35,380
um no hasta que una from that door

876
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:38,049
anything right um so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm living</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

877
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,420
working probably more developing part of

the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> min Asia region is is quite</font>

879
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:46,390
diverse we've got Japan Korea were very

880
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:49,299
much developed and as far as developed

881
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,430
as North America's when it comes to a

882
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,680
lot of internet and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> fleeing on a</font>

883
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:56,259
path like southern central issue where

884
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,640
the exchange points are a coming thing

885
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,099
as kind of alluded to in the

886
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,930
presentation very much i find the

887
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:03,820
developing parts of the peering exchange

888
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,129
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first thing that goes in there</font>

889
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,950
that is if the telco hasn't got there

890
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,470
first and set up the monopolies internet

891
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,819
service so very much they're having

892
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,830
thought about this over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,330
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> since being invited on this I</font>

894
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,480
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the peering exchanges very much</font>

895
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:23,200
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see first happening in the</font>

896
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,599
marketplace as such and as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

897
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,910
economy and developed the exchange part

<font color="#CCCCCC">become successful commercial operations</font>

899
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:34,118
whether the telco or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Greenfield new</font>

900
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,160
providers come along they will try and

901
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:38,320
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of competition to the</font>

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,509
exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> point which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably what</font>

903
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,400
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> call commercial exchange which</font>

904
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:44,410
tends to be more transit provider

905
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,450
certain in three or four countries that

906
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:48,490
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked in I've been pulled into</font>

907
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:52,540
projects which involves building and

<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange which is actually similar to</font>

00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:01,810
the transit exchange model so I mean I

912
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:04,270
certainly believe you can look at a lot

913
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,859
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asian examples we start off with</font>

more towards Europe for their model

00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:31,610
is still I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's probably</font>

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,589
halfway and that

926
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,660
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing we could</font>

other questions from the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,640
well one one<font color="#E5E5E5"> last question do you guys</font>

938
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:12,740
then and we'll wrap up um so the thing

939
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,799
that puzzles me that I've been trying

940
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:18,140
figure out is if we have the sort of

941
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:22,190
what should be an ideal market of

942
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:24,859
appearing strange and say to transit

943
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:26,720
exchanges in a metro area and the

944
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,750
peering exchange is very cheap say a

945
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,080
hundred dollars a month and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

946
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:35,510
transit exchanges are more expensive but

947
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,009
perfectly supportable in light of what

948
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,290
people are willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend say there</font>

949
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:44,300
are a few thousand dollars a month each

950
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:46,790
and most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are customers of both of</font>

951
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the transit exchanges and they're buying</font>

952
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:52,400
and selling transit there if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">case why bother with the peering</font>

954
00:43:52,400 --> 00:44:00,160
exchange at all that is how is it that

955
00:43:55,370 --> 00:44:03,859
we continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see a thriving market for</font>

956

958
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,590
the same the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> region I mean like</font>

959
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:17,509

960
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:20,690

<font color="#CCCCCC">tell house and tell city we've got links</font>

962
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:27,650
we've got exchange point and we've got

963
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:29,450
low now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I right I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this comes</font>

964
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,450
back to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was saying that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

965
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:34,069
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> there being a clear-cut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distinction</font>

968
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:41,170
significantly from critical mass I think

969
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:43,210
the view that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking on this is</font>

970
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,890
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually two different</font>

971
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,049
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can offer over the</font>

972
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:49,029
same infrastructure particularly once

973
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:52,990
you start doing veal and stuff and

974
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:56,020
unable to 1q subinterfaces on the

975
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,578
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ritter side it isn't actually</font>

976
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,650
that hard to build an infrastructure

977
00:44:57,579 --> 00:45:04,150
which will support both transit and

978
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:06,160
clearing services and whether your

979
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,530
participants use that primarily for

980
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,819
peering a transit is to some extent how

981
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,970
you price and differentiate the

982
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:14,079
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> services that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're offering</font>

983
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:15,910
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we're doing for</font>

984
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,470
example in negotiating in to connect

985
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:21,819
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the smaller exchanges in</font>

986
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:23,439
London because potentially they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

987
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,270
some benefit maybe from peeling some of

988
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,799
our customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> but our customers who are</font>

989
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,299
selling transit see that as a

990
00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:34,359
marketplace<font color="#CCCCCC"> Utley concern additional</font>

991
00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:37,140
transit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so I think that a bit of</font>

992
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:39,430
competition is good both<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

993
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,710
marketing point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also from</font>

994
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:44,410
the resilience point of view but there

995
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,450
are also critical mass benefits and I

996
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:49,839
think there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> room for more than one</font>

997
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:51,368
exchange in each city I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that there</font>

998
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,960
is room probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> for slightly more</font>

999
00:45:51,369 --> 00:45:54,819
transit exchanges in a given market

1000
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,420
place than there is in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> during</font>

1001
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:59,950
exchanges but I think in reality what

1002
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,470
we're going to see is two or three

1003
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,669
exchanges per city one or more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which</font>

1004
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,259
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have main emphasis and</font>

1005
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,520
peering but we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some transit</font>

1006
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,290
and the others which would be mainly

1007
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:14,049
transit but were also disappearing as

1008
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:15,790
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah I tend to agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1009
00:46:14,049 --> 00:46:19,470
just from what what I've seen happening

1010
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:21,730
in my part of the world people like

1011
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:24,308
redundancy so that there's some

1012
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:26,619
redundancy there they still the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conflict</font>

1013
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:28,210
of appearing exchange is cheap it's it's

1014
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:30,730
generally a good service it works pretty

1015
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,890
well and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they want the</font>

1016
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:34,660
transit provider the transit exchange is

1017
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:38,230
always there as backup the clean is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1018
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:41,109
more expensive task to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take and people</font>

1019
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:43,620
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to try and save money in any</font>

1020
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:46,509
possible we can

1021
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,980
again in the Asian region a lot of the

1022
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,410
exchange is hard to distinguish whether

1023
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,090
repealing exchanges or transit exchanges

1024
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:54,670
as such as you get both functions

1025
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:57,310
happening on both but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will tend</font>

1026
00:46:54,670 --> 00:47:01,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and go to two things rather than</font>

1027
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:05,070
rely on just one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well I think</font>

1028
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that wraps it up press</font>
