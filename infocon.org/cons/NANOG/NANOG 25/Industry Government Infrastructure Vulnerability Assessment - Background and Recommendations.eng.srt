2002 Dick Clark called a meeting of

about 40 people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a room that was</font>

27
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,470
got our first visit from Dick Clark

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,960
wondering you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimized view</font>

what different view<font color="#CCCCCC"> take viewpoints on</font>

what infrastructure vulnerabilities were

31
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:20,610
so at that meeting a bunch of groups got

know some government consultant to

63
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,230
actually get so there are a number of

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,269
assumptions made not all of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreed</font>

65
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,040
with these in particular I don't agree

66
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,530
with number one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the assumption</font>

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,239
that we can sort of assume that although

68
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,670
poor software quality is a problem it

69
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,590
will somehow magically get dealt with in

70
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,119
my opinion poor software quality is one

71
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,799
of the biggest problems we have that

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,290
actually leads to security problems on

73
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,269
the internet but that was an assumption

74
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,400
we didn't address that another issue

75
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,230
that we didn't address was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're</font>

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government or not me but they're</font>

90
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,870
about key recommendations and then go

through some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the recommendations for</font>

/ peering / router architecture groups

95
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,010
which is what I was most involved in and

96
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,388
then provided a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font>

97
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just talk briefly about that I think</font>

98
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we as a community should think</font>

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,579
about so best practices for address

accountability filtering access

101
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,859
controlled authentication change control

102
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,540
a lot of even government networks would

103
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,859
be surprised how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many networks don't</font>

104
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,590
really have much in the way of change

105
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:06,060
control personnel policies and

106
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,370
procedures although this was mostly

107
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,049
unspecified as a future effort you know

108
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,329
how do you screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> not people or do you</font>

109
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,810
screen not<font color="#E5E5E5"> people standardized training</font>

110
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,519
again this week successfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you</font>

111
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">got this away from certifying you know</font>

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,280
routing engineers and then also training

113
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,120
people explaining to people that there

114
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,460
are two processes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> enric</font>

115
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,400
of the FCC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stacked of the</font>

116
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,080
NCS that are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at infrastructure</font>

117
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,138
vulnerabilities and referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them</font>

118
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,580
I'm not clear what the actual you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

119
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,470
take away from establishing best

120
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,930
practices is whether that will involve

121
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,840
nanog who that will involve but that's

122
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the government seems to</font>

123
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,460
be in favor of and personally I think we

124
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,349
do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a lot of training and</font>

125
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">outreach no matter who does it about</font>

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,680
best practices furthermore that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs</font>

127
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,169
vendors and government be able to

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,960
establish robust communication channels

129
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:05,570
that are secure that rely less on people

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,729
who know each other and know each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

131
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,250
cell phones and no you know and more on

132
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:12,770
a formal process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and obviously Kelly</font>

133
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,440
Cooper's been counting the sand you know

134
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,229
for this and nanog and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

135
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,690
that you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should think about is</font>

136
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:24,280
because personal relationships may not

137
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,270
cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if there's a real serious attack</font>

138
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,530
establishing better network management

139
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,659
capabilities i think we heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

140
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,690
yesterday too that some people would

141
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,490
rather have more focus on a UI that was

142
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,139
in configuration management methods that

143
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,090
were less prone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to error and more</font>

144
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:42,320
consistent a study and again it's not

145
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,690
clear where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data would come from</font>

146
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,700
that the government would conduct or

147
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,169
have someone conduct to look at

148
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,680
centralization of inter connection

149
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:53,900
basically someone wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cause more</font>

150
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,669
damage on September 11th and they hit

151
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,919
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 hudson won 11 eight and</font>

152
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,900
twenty five broadway would you have been

153
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,460
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know decrease enough the</font>

154
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,780
communication flow because the internet

155
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,719
was really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing working in</font>

156
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,309
manhattan on September<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11th to amplify</font>

157
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,900
the effect of the attack so the

158
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,849
government's actually curious about that

159
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,239
and if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help or if you're</font>

160
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:16,120
scared you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should contact them similarly</font>

161
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,970
the government as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said had an agenda</font>

162
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,500
to try to get law enforcement easier

163
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,930
ability to see data which networks

164
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,340
wouldn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share with others and</font>

165
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,919
maybe share it around the government

166
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,630
which today there's a concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

167
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,430
can't do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you share data about</font>

168
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,340
your infrastructure someone else may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

169
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,800
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go get that and then there's a</font>

170
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,109
proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean Sean Donnellan are you</font>

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,009
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so at the end if</font>

172
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,289
there's questions about

173
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:44,509
his group I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually did proposed</font>

174
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,969
creating a national internet disaster

175
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,430
management team and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been I think</font>

176
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:53,300
who was it that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a you</font>

177
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,550
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nih</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type analog for virus</font>

178
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,689
alerting so there's some thought about

179
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,719
that so my personal summary before we

180
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:04,339
get to the individual working groups is

181
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:07,369
that there are some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

182
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:09,740
government's very hot on and address

183
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:12,770
accountability meaning who is allowed to

184
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,520
advertise what IP space and driving that

185
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,919
filtering of both packets and routes is

186
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,469
something that they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot on and s</font>

187
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp is one of the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

188
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:26,389
funding and they're even<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font>

189
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:28,669
for example saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> gsa will not allow</font>

190
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,589
you to buy connectivity from someone who

191
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,419
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s bt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not have</font>

192
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:34,159
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> capability and that's something</font>

193
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:36,378
that's being driven not because anyone

194
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:39,169
thinks SBG p is the most wonderful thing

195
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:40,520
but because it's been 5 10 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

196
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,899
everyone's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about how nice</font>

197
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">it would be to filter the infrastructure</font>

198
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:48,610
and because you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

199
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:51,169
vulnerabilities do to each separately a

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,330
package not being filtered and be rel

201
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,609
talking soldier and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that no</font>

202
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,870
one's done a devastating<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack on the</font>

203
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,749
internet infrastructure for eight hours

204
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,550
on purpose using you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the lack of</font>

205
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:03,740
source address filtering or relative era

206
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,909
fication doesn't mean that it couldn't

207
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,860
happen i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's understanding</font>

208
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,449
that it could so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a provider</font>

209
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,249
level issue and i'll come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

210
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,209
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

211
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,159
something that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

212
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:15,769

213
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,569
proactive on or there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some things</font>

214
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:19,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there is some progress s bgp is</font>

215
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:21,589
making at least visibility wise<font color="#E5E5E5"> aside</font>

216
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,249
the government and we could find

217
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:26,360
ourselves blindsided and again

218
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:28,490
regulation legislation the government

219
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,839
says they don't want to do that i have

220
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">no special knowledge of whether or not</font>

221
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,519
they do they say they don't but things

222
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:37,490
like using their procurement dollars to

223
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,500
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to influence router policy are</font>

224
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,880
definitely on the table in fact they

225
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">were on the table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a year ago from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

226
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,670
we heard so the working group summaries

227
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i apologize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going too fast i'm</font>

228
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,250
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get everyone to the break the</font>

229
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,769
working group summaries i'll present

230
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,140
relatively quickly now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide</font>

231
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:54,970
sets are up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so</font>

232
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,460
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the vulnerabilities</font>

233
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,320
themselves well most of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

234
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">this room probably would not be a great</font>

235
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,760
shock to you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not putting all</font>

236
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,130
those up because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all archived</font>

237
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,630
but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine from the</font>

238
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,700
recommendations what the vulnerabilities

239
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,050
were and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may touch on a couple so I'm</font>

240
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">not presenting those and this is very</font>

241
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:16,270
exerted both because I'm not sure how

242
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,520
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the product we can release but</font>

243
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">and because we don't have enough time</font>

244
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,380
but if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in more and</font>

245
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,579
you're an operator or a vendor we can

246
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,200
put you in touch with the people who can

247
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,020
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full output and in fact</font>

248
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a CD full of papers or each</font>

249
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,560
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group had I don't know 20 pages</font>

250
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:38,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">worth so a lot of output and i think one</font>

251
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,890
key question going forward is how do

252
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,570
nanog ITF different audiences but the

253
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,100
operational sanity and then the people

254
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">who might actually drive something to</font>

255
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,700
get it implemented how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

256
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in things like this in the</font>

257
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,170
future because you know the way American

258
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,939
government reacts is boom something

259
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,650
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's react and then</font>

260
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,510
there's this decay and hopefully nothing

261
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,459
else will happen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so next year this</font>

262
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,410
will still be hot third year after won't

263
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,150
be as hot and again hopefully nothing

264
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,069
will happen that will renew it but

265
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,840
presumably next year this will still be

266
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,340
hot and the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

267
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,270
plugged in the government is actually

268
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:15,400
looking for input so vgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS working</font>

269
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,420
group this was led by Steve Blumenthal

270
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,189
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genuity and they were obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

271
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:25,599
two sets of things being looked at dns

272
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:28,300
and bgp the recommendations<font color="#CCCCCC"> for dns i</font>

273
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,030
guess like<font color="#CCCCCC"> many other things pointed at</font>

274
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,560
the need to do filtering of packets and

275
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,839
routes and that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font>

276
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,579
to me presentation that we heard earlier

277
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,490
that suggests maybe there are some

278
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,040
things that we can do proactively with

279
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,500
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roots or even maybe not with the</font>

280
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,760
roots but with the you gannett dial<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

281
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,190
servers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be even more critical</font>

282
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,400
than the roots which also don't change

283
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,720
origin you know much one of the

284
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,370
interesting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say is</font>

285
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,470
controversial is the question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

286
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need an alternative dns</font>

287
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,420
software set genetically whether bind is

288
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,880
secure enough or could be secure enough

289
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,719
or whether any package is secure enough

290
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,430
that implements all the features

291
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,620
and that's but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a recommendation</font>

292
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,959
would that be looked into whether it's

293
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft or whether it's you know there</font>

294
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,229
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different things out there</font>

295
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,170
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is something</font>

296
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,730
complicated is that if you could

297
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,439
penetrate the security on all the DNS

298
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,000
servers or ninety percent of them that

299
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:24,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be a big problem that was probably</font>

300
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most controversial thing there and</font>

301
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,759
the non-controversial things I'd love

302
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS SEC everyone thinks it's reasonably</font>

303
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,050
good finish it up let's get it deployed

304
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,699
among people who want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and get</font>

305
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:39,469
some operational experience what else in

00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:40,969
terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP there is a lot of best</font>

307
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,069
practices talk about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

308
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:47,120
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing what everyone again</font>

00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:49,790
knows max prefix look at dampening use

311
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,879
on a cisco and juniper<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe if you</font>

312
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:58,399
use md5 encryption it's actually using a

313
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,350
tcp feature and so the packet that comes

314
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,779
in is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be dropped at the TCP</font>

315
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,459
layer it's still going to use cpu but

316
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:07,279
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to even bgp is going to</font>

317
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,290
ignore it and that's why you get reset

318
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,180
protection that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting so</font>

319
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,480
there's recommendation to do that people

320
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">to explore IPSec and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think most people</font>

321
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not really worried for bgp about</font>

322
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:20,449
session hijacking and inserting routes

323
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,939
that way it's certainly much much easier

324
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,529
to bribe a janitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean we have three</font>

325
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:26,829
thousand locations across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

326
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,939
and our card<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys often don't work and</font>

327
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,258
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> there no law enforcement in</font>

328
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,790
the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i'll just say it's a lot</font>

329
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:33,800
easier to bribe the janitor than it is

330
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,719
to probably hijack a TCP session and

331
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,709
once you have physical access to the box

332
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,639
flash it's easy so IPSec there was an

333
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,779
interesting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think there</font>

334
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,809
was a lot of interest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because</font>

335
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:46,490
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really see hijacking as the</font>

336
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:48,079
big issue there was a recommendation

337
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government continue to fund</font>

338
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,519
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP I think DISA s 568 is</font>

339
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,930
probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be deploying it and</font>

340
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,019
then there may be some smaller networks

341
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:59,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the play it the question is what what</font>

342
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,889
beyond that what happens beyond that and

343
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,809
that's a big open question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think if</font>

344
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:04,670
the providers a year from now haven't

345
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:07,040
come up with anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even begins</font>

346
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,079
to move towards addressing the who owns

347
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,120
what IP space and how could we do

348
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,459
filtering of routes or packets we could

349
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,569
see the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> using procurement to</font>

350
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:19,400
try to impose s BGP as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution there</font>

351
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:21,530
was talk about designing router

352
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,569
to withstand the US attacks in the

353
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,250
hardening group there was a lot of talk

354
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,290
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> future router architectures and</font>

355
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,180
separating the management control and

356
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,630
forwarding planes I'll touch on that

357
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,819
briefly hey there was a recommendation

358
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,130
to investigate what could be done with

359
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,650
today's routers both<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the ingress and</font>

360
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,810
at the egress of a network for rel

361
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,220
filtering again no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> said all the</font>

362
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,520
hardware out there can support it but

363
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,130
maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be doing a better job and</font>

364
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,420
for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so those were most of the</font>

365
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,250
recommendations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

366
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,589
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Ralph filtering piece on my</font>

367
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,860
personal soapbox saying that we should

368
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:02,240
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing something so terms of</font>

369
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:04,580
hardening I think the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> controversial</font>

370
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,830
question was whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government</font>

371
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,420
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking into how much are</font>

372
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,400
peering is centralized between networks

373
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,349
in other words if you took out all the

374
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,939
big Tokyo hotels that everyone knows of

375
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,590
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to the internet and</font>

376
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,270
then if you have all the tier ones

377
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,820
connecting whatever your definition of

378
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,140
tier one is a large ISPs connecting now

379
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,460
you've got five more buildings and

380
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,319
another five buildings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten buildings</font>

381
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,640
which have a huge amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

382
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,760
interconnectivity that's provision in

383
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. that may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a serious issue now</font>

384
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,290
what anyone could do about that is

385
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,000
unclear but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government has said</font>

386
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,520
there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money to address</font>

387
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,320
issues if they're real and they're happy

388
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do funding and not just do mandates</font>

389
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,830
but this is something that I would say

390
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the controversial piece of</font>

391
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this they're probably some people who</font>

392
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,270
said don't tell the government that we

393
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have them looking at that</font>

394
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,040
and this is not in the context of

395
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,150
regulation it's in the context of is

396
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,099
there something that we can do to

397
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,870
encourage diversity and of course as

398
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,480
everyone who runs<font color="#E5E5E5"> a budget does everyone</font>

399
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,790
who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick in OC 12 type loop in</font>

400
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,580
in less than a year knows there are huge

401
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:08,199
advantages to centralizing but this is

402
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:11,060
again one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the controversial issues</font>

403
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,430
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of van access looking</font>

404
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,349
at router architectures pretty standard

405
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,219
and again anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's really curious</font>

406
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:22,070
can read can get access to and read the

407
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,780
report and the more detailed powerpoint

408
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think one of the more interesting</font>

409
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,260
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was talked on and the</font>

routers are authentication controlled by

machines and you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

419
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:51,199
many networks I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of networks</font>

420
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,610
where the network engineers think

they're better sis admin's than the IT

people which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably true but the</font>

true but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network engineers don't go</font>

425
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,740
back and revisit the security of these

boxes in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> when people are fired they</font>

might have left behind in one of these

sense that this was not no one really

509
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,080
hated the idea i guess it was 18<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

512
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">so but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also get the sense I don't know</font>

513
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,950
whether it was just the rapidly

514
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:31,450
diminishing number of extra people not

515
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,570
needed to urgently do things that

516
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,340
networks about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time or whether you</font>

517
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,520
know just it was interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> not non</font>

518
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,709
offensive but not in not urgent that led

519
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,850
not much action so I think still there's

520
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:47,289
not been much action and I don't think

521
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,080
that's a critical problem the government

522
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:51,250
is about to do something silly but I

523
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,030
think that's something they may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

524
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,860
prod us on

525
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,420
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that could be</font>

526
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,090
helpful for things in the future where

527
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,830
you may not want you know me and five

528
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,179
random people telling the government but

529
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,980
we think the vulnerabilities and

530
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,260
recommendations are you may want it to

531
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,600
be a wider set of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if there's</font>

532
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,320
a place the government can go that might

533
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually help that similar the same</font>

534
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,330
thing single for them and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

535
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">training and coordination there was</font>

536
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:23,720
enforcement in privacy most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

537
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,610
the predetermined goal of making it<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font>

538
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,240

sort of mandatory that it be disclosed

540
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,340
so the summary there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

541
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:37,460
interests among a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

546
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,360
there's funding over at DARPA and NSF

547
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,430
and there's a lot of information that

548
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,020
they'd like together and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font>

549
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,120
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actions that they're thinking</font>

because there's funding and it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,860
bad because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the funding is applied</font>

554
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,960
stupidly there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of awareness</font>

555
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,750
among people who you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't know</font>

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,670
what bgp means that what bgp is what

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:55,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that it is critical again that we</font>

574
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:57,260
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what to do about address</font>

575
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,530
accountability and route the packet

576
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,300
filtering I have you know my pet idea

577
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:05,240
other people may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> their pet ideas</font>

578
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:08,270
but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the issue is how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

579
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,670
a set of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's useful for</font>

580
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,650
filtering that does not go down the

582
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,230
involved and does not go down the

583
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,419
landmine of what let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

584
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,220
policy get involved maybe it's a matter

585
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,900
right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tour is already delegated to</font>

586
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,670
people if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring a root on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

machines that control<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS you already</font>

588
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,840
have a problem I don't know what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

589
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,080
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's something that the</font>

590
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,639
nanog<font color="#CCCCCC"> clade community needs to drive</font>

591
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,290
because right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see anything</font>

592
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:37,970
and the government certainly doesn't see

593
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:39,860
anything and that's this slide the other

594
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,410
thing that I would say is the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

595
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,570
scares<font color="#E5E5E5"> me most is the five guys bribing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">igp and anything that we can do to</font>

00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow up on some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the research work</font>

599
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,500
that was presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know</font>

600
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,709
6-12 month<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame make it so that</font>

601
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,270
that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> much less catastrophic or</font>

602
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,310
it wouldn't be completely catastrophic

603
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,840
not much less as sort of a binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

604
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,210
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely catastrophic today</font>

605
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,159
if you did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the big five a esas I</font>

606
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,930
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good and that's</font>

607
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,100
frankly my biggest concern that's

608
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,190
protocol related about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

609
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:16,010
infrastructure security and then again

610
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,200
just I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think no matter who picks it up</font>

611
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,690
and drives it no matter what things we

612
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,150
discuss we need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about filtering</font>

613
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,500
as not just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea not just maybe I</font>

614
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,240
should put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at appearing contract</font>

615
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,670
but something they come along and

616
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,580
surprise us if we don't so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

617
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,590
was the key message as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as you know</font>

618
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,960
feel free to contact me if you want to

619
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">get plugged into the nice government</font>

620
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,870
people who are here to help so that's my

621
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,870
presentation

622
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:57,429
questions flames comments I don't know

623
00:23:52,330 --> 00:24:00,249
it's sort of slowly wandering up hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> ivy</font>

624
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:02,379
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions I guess one course</font>

625
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:04,419
energy there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human in</font>

626
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:06,549
the presentation that that government

627
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,230
involvement or that us getting involved

628
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:11,619
to help the government help us is

629
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,519
somehow a good idea did this<font color="#CCCCCC"> group of</font>

630
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,289
people who got<font color="#E5E5E5"> together with the</font>

631
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,169
government I guess one questions were

632
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:18,340
they you know was there financial you

633
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,409
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things at risk where these guys</font>

634
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,320
getting government contracts is that the

635
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:24,820
relationship and if they were is that

636
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">why they were participating in if they</font>

637
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,450
warrants was it the perception that you

638
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,418
know there could be some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

639
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,769
financial arrangements you know why

640
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:34,929
would these guys doing this right is the

641
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:36,399
question I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we were doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I can</font>

642
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak for myself because we were afraid</font>

643
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,869
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what would happen if people who</font>

644
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,549
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything operationally you</font>

645
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:44,889
know it all would be involved there were

646
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,029
people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> then surf there I think you</font>

647
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:47,439
know Akamai doesn't things with the

648
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,539
government I think all the major telcos

649
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,669
have government contracts but no one was

650
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,799
paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it and there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are no promises of</font>

651
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:55,539
you'll get this work if you do this and

652
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:57,340
it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work as Sean can tell</font>

653
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:58,419
you is you know some of the other people

654
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in these working groups</font>

655
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:03,309
can tell you but you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

656
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,299
there are certainly things I can tell

657
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,950
you that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have said you need to</font>

658
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:07,899
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> optum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I put into</font>

659
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:12,580
recommendations but I didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

660
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:13,570
sense anyone was trying to do that one

661
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">other question now one of the things</font>

662
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,009
that was stated that it's very important

663
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:20,860
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an AS to prefix matching but</font>

664
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:22,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I RR was not the way to do it is it</font>

665
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,369
sort of grown up all I are really is I

666
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,470
mean in theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> twist have a lot of</font>

667
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:28,779
policy information and reality all it's

668
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,509
good for at this point is in reality a

669
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:34,090
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a s matching thank you can you</font>

670
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:35,950
say why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't think that's is just</font>

671
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,209
to do so much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know horrible data and</font>

672
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,919
there's or there's not well

673
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,080
authenticated or there's so much

674
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,110
horrible brain poison when you mention

675
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,820
the term I are about you know people who

676
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,949
just need to sentiment each other about

677
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,119
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's accurate enough the</font>

678
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,669
bottom line is we need to assemble

679
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,830
something and I think the big issue that

680
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:55,899
people have with one of the big green

681
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,129
poison inducing issues is they don't

682
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">want policy to be out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

683
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,520
the idea that you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to see</font>

684
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could see by just</font>

685
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,770
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> bdp you know but the lawyers</font>

686
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,629
may not like is a big issue this is just

687
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">my personal again this is my personal</font>

688
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,670
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> is i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful if</font>

689
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,679
we are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about what to do to</font>

690
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:19,390
get this origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> i asked to prefix</font>

691
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,730
mapping down to not try to convert an

692
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,230
irr to that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we'll turn</font>

693
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,700
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the community that we need</font>

694
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:28,570
involved that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my personal opinion</font>

695
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:31,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay one last question in relationship</font>

696
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,200
hearing and centralization of<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering of</font>

697
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,270
course a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people think it says</font>

698
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,620
incredibly bad idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the</font>

699
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">government involved in any way with the</font>

700

parent but on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand there are</font>

701
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,520
concerns about the shared tenant

702

initiative and you know now called ice

703
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,650
and in coal you know there's a move now

704
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,080
not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the 60</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hudson and 111 eighth</font>

705
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,580
avenues but it moves like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot</font>

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of large skier wants to consolidate a</font>

00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,939
lot of peering and a few locations to

overcome valid technical difficulties

709
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,580
will the is there any prescription that

710
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,340
the government will get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

711
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,889

in any sort of negative way I haven't

don't have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest in the policy of</font>

this and I've heard people say that

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's money that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used for</font>

things if there's a problem with

731
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,870
centralization there are things that

732

they could fund whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not they're</font>

better security around the inner

know security<font color="#CCCCCC"> at those points may be</font>

thinks it's a bad idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also many</font>

742
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,430
people just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the government</font>

involvement in government money

744
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,550
increasing security at certain tension

745
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,200
points reduces the competitiveness of

other connection points less

747
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,500
competitiveness is less capitalism and

748
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,760
you know that's what government

749
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">involvement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government money off of meat</font>

750
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,760
nozzle personally I think either

751
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,810
alternative is dangerous just quickly

752
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,810
addressing your question because I was

753
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:33,260
there to the government people I spoke

754
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:35,659
to very specifically did not just talk

755
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">about secure one ISPs or larger eyes</font>

756
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,460
peas as part of the issue it's

757
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,379
centralized peering just in general and

758
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,680
it covers a whole number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

759
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,210
facets of organization there was I don't

00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,510
believe there was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> any attention</font>

on any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a regulatory</font>

763
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:59,270
of policy for pairing between ISPs would

764
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,000
you say that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> crew hobby I would</font>

agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes definitely just enjoy a</font>

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,500
question there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix feel it might</font>

767
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:10,400
be a target of government moves

769
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,610
there's any indication that government

770
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,590
would move to decentralize peering I

771
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,379
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the indications are that</font>

772
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:20,030
they're analyzing the physical risks

associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it and what would be</font>

the physical risks associated with what

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:31,250
they perceive as necessity centralized

appearing and encourage diversity as

much as possible which you know there's

information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just like to clarify one</font>

783
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:57,290
thing on some earlier slides he said

784
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:59,330
recommendations and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clarify some of</font>

those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas we came up with</font>

786

and we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have enough time to</font>

787
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:06,740
actually sit down and decide either

788
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:11,950
individually or as companies that that

789
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:14,480
is in fact a recommendation secondly as

790
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,890
I think everyone has said as the

791
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">government is looking for input from</font>

00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,810
folks and in particular I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to</font>
