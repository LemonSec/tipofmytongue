149
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,170
that gave us

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,388
certainty on the design but also

151
00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:00,630
certainty in terms of budgeting that we

152
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:03,750
could afford the investment it was

out ourselves how best to deploy them

165
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,820
and then shouted juniper if we got

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,060
excellent investment we had a

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,610
particularly top guy in terms of the

get to low level design and testing we

179
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,030
also had a resident engineer working

180
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,090
with us he was fundamental to the

181
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,760
migration work but also great assistance

182
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,169
to the training<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my team we did formal</font>

183
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,110
training but there's nothing obviously

184
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,969
like no hands-on and having someone

185
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,970
alongside you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> advise when things get</font>

186
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:30,300
a bit tricky as we got through that

187
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,580
testing work we decided to stage all of

188
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,680
the equipment at a staging facility with

189
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,349
agreed this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the program with</font>

190
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,689
juniper and their partner within the UK

191
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:42,570
so there was a facility lined up for

192
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,940
that all the kit was configured staged

193
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,130
and then moved out to the sites for

194
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,440
deployment and integration into the live

195
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,120
network said resident engineer

196
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,220
supporters through the migration we also

197
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,990
had enhanced tax support from juniper

198
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,180
such live we had any issues during

199
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,690
migration windows we had a direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

200
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,660
through to tack and importantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us</font>

201
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,890
and our members again juniper stood up

202
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,290
to the challenge of

203
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:11,830
twenty percent retention over 30 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

205

over before we we paid the final bill so

206
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,740
just coming to the design fairly high

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,150
someone who understood how to build a

293
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,040
network who happened to be a program

294
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,260
manager rather than the other way round

295
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,270
it was important that we had someone who

296
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,569
actually knew how to do what he was

297
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,640
doing we then did<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that you'd</font>

298
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,530
expect from a program report we formed a

299
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,710
you know clear steer involved with

300
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,510
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in charge of areas such as design</font>

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:19,569
represented to make sure we had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">end system development done on time we</font>

304
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,190
built a clearly defined program we had

305
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,020
all of the stages laid into that that I

306
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,120
touched on<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier that sign off from</font>

laid out<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a series of maintenance</font>

313
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,069

decommissioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old language gave us</font>

315
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,839
back space and cleared all of the the

<font color="#E5E5E5">old cabling out we held weekly program</font>

317
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,220
reviews where we obviously made sure

318
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,529
everything was on track<font color="#E5E5E5"> we you know</font>

320
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">made sure that as a team where we</font>

321
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:03,029
supported each other through this all

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way we had juniper involved in those</font>

323
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:08,010
it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a Lynx activity and that</font>

324
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,189
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that all of those sign offs</font>

325
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:13,560
were actually achieved as they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

326
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">on time and we also built a clear</font>

communication process with links members

328
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:22,680
we set up a special website for them we

329
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:24,750
posted the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans we built a tool</font>

330
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,449
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they could actually look to see</font>

331
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,670
when all of their ports were due for

332
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,770
migration so many members<font color="#CCCCCC"> are present</font>

333
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,589
across many of the age switches so they

334
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,569
could actually look to see when each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

their pumps with my great on a specific

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,029
night in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition i sent a weekly update</font>

337
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,680
effectively out to the membership really

338
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,930
telling them where we were how things

339
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,670
were going what was on track<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where</font>

340
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,760
we were off track and what we were doing

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:53,130
to bring those things back in program

342
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,290
plan which I glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you I won't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dwell on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it huge detail this really just</font>

344
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,010
tells you there was a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

345
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">activities that we had to achieve it</font>

346
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:03,060
wasn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the land at the top of</font>

347
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you'll actually see that we had to</font>

348
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,250
lay additional capacity into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brocade</font>

349
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,079
land to actually get us through the

350
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,720
migration window we started this

351
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,490
exercise running about 600 gig through

352
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brocade land by the end of it we</font>

353
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:21,120
were up to not far short of 800 791 gig

354
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,970
so in fact we had to play in the

355
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,980
expansion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that network to get us</font>

356
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,260
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually build</font>

357
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,940
out the transport network we went from a

358
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,860
ring architecture so we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring a</font>

359
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,890
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> additional fibers in we had to</font>

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">do a parent each of the age switch is</font>

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,269
that require this to actual

362
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,820
Elena a far more extensive optical

363
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:43,649

365
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:48,839
stuff I told<font color="#CCCCCC"> you before the design and</font>

366
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,820
testing phase is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff then was</font>

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,100
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the systems that we</font>

368
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,459
needed primarily around asset management

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,140
alarm monitoring filtering and actually

370
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,359
being added bill members at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end was</font>

371
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,600
all in place and ready to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and worked</font>

377
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,370
we do well or the first thing is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

378
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,849
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on time we did exactly what we</font>

379
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:23,160
said we would do we didn't suffer any

380
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,170
unplanned downtime during the whole

381
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,689
process everything completed to time

382
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:31,560
within each maintenance window with very

383
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,360
few member tickets being raised that was

384
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">really based on the fact that that close</font>

385
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,339
collaboration with juniper all the way

386
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,829
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the design worked it</font>

387
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,410
did exactly what it said it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do my</font>

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,579
engineering team threw themselves into

389
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,350
this they had to learn a new

390
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">architecture there to be trained on a</font>

391
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,140
platform that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they hadn't actually</font>

392
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,790
worked on before most of them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> during</font>

393
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,670
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the phases I had</font>

394
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:59,250
guys back doing junior for training

395
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,229
courses you know they did a good job

396
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,290
showed a high level commitment worked as

397
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,299
a single team it all sounds great but

398
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">like all of these programs you know we</font>

399
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:10,559
did have some weed you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some issues</font>

400
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,209
as well we had an early<font color="#E5E5E5"> near miss the</font>

401
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier near miss was really down to</font>

402
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:18,540
almost predictably just not enough

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,980
preparation we'd gone to site we had

404
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,319
some optical problems during the Mike

405
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,410
referred migration window between two

406
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,780
other sites and what happened was we had

407
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,910
three guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> on site there wasn't a clear</font>

408
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,559
person in charge there were three good

409
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,809
engineers but therefore no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

410
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,210
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in charge on the night and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

411
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:41,129
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hadn't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> labeled up and</font>

412
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,900
recorded the results on the cabling and

413
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,960
the patching which he's you know boring

414
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,640
stuff but it has to be done and what

415
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,890
that meant was there was less controlled

416
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,450
on

417
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,760
night<font color="#CCCCCC"> there should have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact</font>

418
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,290
they recovered it the site was left

419
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,140
looking a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mess we had to go</font>

420
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:58,510
back and tidy up afterwards but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

421
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a lot of learning from that and the</font>

422
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,100
learning was the obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you make</font>

423
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,659
sure that for each site there's one

424
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,300
clear person one of your better

425
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,520
engineers is actually in charge that he

426
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,399
and his team all know what they're doing

427
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the preparation work before make</font>

the patches are ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is</font>

430
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:21,669
labeled up all everything is tested all

431
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,670
the results are at hand so that on the

432
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,720
night if something goes wrong

433
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,730
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got a lot of</font>

reference material to work from and you

cabled changeover exercise that we had

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,990
had to take out of racks because Colo

<font color="#E5E5E5">say to them we've started and we</font>

what won't be so good at we didn't

was far too long an elapsed time before

very well we've got excellent feedback

completed a low level design on the

552
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,910
twenty-second of July but the key

553
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,909
migration dates at the end is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

finalize the design took it into service

on the 22nd de sep tember started the

migration on the 27th completed it on

time on the twenty-ninth of<font color="#CCCCCC"> october</font>

at the end of the migration successfully

562
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:29,000
migrated without incident so what what

563
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:33,140
happened along the way war stories are

564
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,660
always good fun so we said that we had

565
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,280
agreed early on to set up staging

566
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,020
facility we should have checked the

567
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,870
staging facility some of you may think

568
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,960
this looks less professional than you

569
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,780
would expect and so did we when we saw

570
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,480
it it had two major problems associated

571
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,940
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it one is that it had insufficient</font>

572
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,790
power and racking as you can see so the

573
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,310
racking was pallets the power was coming

574
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,889
off of wall sockets we managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kill</font>

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,360
short<font color="#CCCCCC"> period where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of decided</font>

581
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,700
that the partner probably didn't know

582
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,919
their ass from their elbow we decided

583
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,690
that evacuating this facility was a

584
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,520
really

585
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,180
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> luckily we had a new facility</font>

586
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,889
at tele house west we only had a patch

587
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,830
for a minute at a time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly</font>

588
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:37,180
had a whole host of switches in there so

589
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:38,740
effectively this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq area I</font>

00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,270
think on Thursday evening we work

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,310
closely with telli house did a fantastic

592
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,600
job with us we had some racking

593
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,330
ourselves they provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> us with</font>

594
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,990
additional racks we laid power in very

595
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:51,460
quickly overnight with these racks we

596
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,160
had to get equipment here so there's a

597
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,670
man with a pallet trolley and he's

598
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically about probably about 120</font>

612
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:33,699
is to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a fiber partner we ordered</font>

613
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,260
additional fibers to provide us with the

00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,820
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual site connectivity that require</font>

615
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,070
this to go through some maintenance

00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,190
getting them to our comms rooms so what

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,040
could possibly go wrong well we like a

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,590
good riot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> London and we had an</font>

outbreak of these through the summer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

622
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,280
that basically killed off a number of

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintenance windows that we had to</font>

627
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:10,390
again we absorbed that delay connectors

00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:13,690
this is our wonderfully exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> mux</font>

see they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not much that could go wrong</font>

631
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,510
in there unless of course your vendor

632
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,640
supplies you with a bunch of moldings

633
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:25,240
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't very strong and it brittle</font>

634

635
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,590
were connecting up some links they were

636
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,050
disconnecting themselves so we had a an

637
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,090
activity to basically replace a number

638
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,470
of these links before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could get</font>

through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a is in fact some of them we are</font>

640
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,580
I'll proactively changing because the

641
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,470

642
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,199
the whole lot so we're going through

643
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:47,090
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> process now patching what could</font>

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly go wrong here well what could</font>

645
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,809
go wrong is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could completely forget</font>

646
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,908
but in actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact equipment doesn't</font>

647
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,799
work unless you put it in colo

648
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:58,880
facilities and actually connected back

649
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,440
to frames and members so in fact we we

650
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,970
missed far more than we should have done

651
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,059
here it was part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of us</font>

652
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:07,820
managing spice and power correctly we

653
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:09,770
again we spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> about another 150,000</font>

654
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,428

655
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:15,650
in the budget at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the start and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again is</font>

656
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:18,890
a lesson to make sure that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage</font>

657
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:21,950
these things not better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> June</font>

658
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:25,610
us far more straightforward story all on

659
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,220
10-4 we did the POC on release one final

660
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,439
testing was done on release<font color="#CCCCCC"> five we're</font>

663
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,789
doesn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect us because we</font>

664
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,939
don't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp other than to actually set</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">up the vpls service at the age but in</font>

666
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:47,059
terms of best practice we thought it was

667
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:49,190
best to eliminate any any even tiny

668
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,970
problem so we moved with agreement to

669
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:55,659
release<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 just before we put the network</font>

670
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:57,590
live and then after the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> night's</font>

671
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:59,390
migration we found we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a load</font>

672
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:02,658
balancing problem on the legs that it

673
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,179
wasn't balancing equivalently across the

674
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:08,299
leg group members so in fact we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

further upgrade to release 7 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 on</font>

678

looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this so before load</font>

unequally loaded across leg group

681
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:22,750
members and a nice little tidy pattern

off to the right after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd done that</font>

members the original design was about

700 gig when we signed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that current</font>

692
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,460

696
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:56,658

<font color="#E5E5E5">figures so there's a difference between</font>

what it could theoretically do if we

700
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:03,109
plugged everything up and what it's

701
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,549
actually doing at the moment if we use

702
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:07,428
they've reported the edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network</font>

703
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:09,859
I could produce a figure that says it

00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:11,599
will support 9.6 terabits but I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

708
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,919
wouldn't get all that traffic through

00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:21,799
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> core because the core isn't built</font>

out as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I could do the same</font>

able to scale this platform through this

716
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:38,958
year and in fact what we'll do is we'll

717
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,789
upgrade those two denser sites to PTX

718

about that moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that roughly</font>

triples the capacity of our core in
