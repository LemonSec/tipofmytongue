the past with what we call the laptop

59
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,078
shuffle where we had a laptop on stage

60
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:23,930
and classically we would have a

61
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,430
presenter who would bring a laptop at

62
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last second and asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to swap it</font>

63

in so they could do a demo or<font color="#E5E5E5"> have put</font>

it updated slide deck whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may</font>

65
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,738
be we've eliminated that we hope that

66
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,140
this makes the presentations a little

67
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,299
more dynamic gives as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see I've</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">got my hands-free get a little remote I</font>

can flip through the slides with we

70
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,769
would love to hear your<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback in the</font>

71
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,660
surveys if you think that this has

72
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,519
improved the quality of presentations in

73
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,930
any way or if you think for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reason</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it hasn't improved them we'd love to</font>

we do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> validation with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco IP SLA</font>

151
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,240
to make sure that each of those

152
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:01,039
neighbors are reachable and then yank

153
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,949
the neighbor down if we don't see that

154
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,659
being the case you'll note if you're

155
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,000
careful you'll note that we're doing

156
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">some layer 3 and therefore ecmp in the</font>

158
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:16,129
for the inbound so<font color="#CCCCCC"> straightforward and</font>

159
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:18,650
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you've any problems with</font>

160
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:20,900
this but so far we have not they had a

161
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,229
substantial difficulty of any transit

162
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,669
related business here the internal

163
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,620
network is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight forward as</font>

164
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,539
well we've gotten to the point where

165
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,169
we've enough equipment and enough

166
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:35,000
facility support to support the entirety

167
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:38,318
of the internal network layer at gigabit

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,819
speed and from the border router<font color="#CCCCCC"> inwards</font>

169
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,129
to all the access points and so forth we

170
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,870
have pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> high capacity access at this</font>

171
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,789
point we used to do some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

172
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,050
might have been shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> pasties</font>

173
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,699
throughout the building but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font>

174
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,979
we had the facility and the fortunate

175
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,500
access to use enough wire to achieve

176
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:56,960
this so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> one gig everywhere</font>

177
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,339
we're next<font color="#CCCCCC"> mech next step if you will is</font>

00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:35,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">and secure the hotel venue as opposed to</font>

contracts right but we didn't have host

234
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:47,910
so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a wonderful privilege to</font>
