selecting name server from time to time

29
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,700
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer three questions the</font>

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,820
first way is to all those casual

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,689
resolvers select the fastest of nip

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,630
server and if we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done some cash</font>

33
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,539
reservoir station that do not select the

34
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,929
fastest name server instead they choose

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,409
some slower one we want to answer if

36
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,829
that mistake or they just intend to do

37
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:53,579
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the third question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the</font>

38
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,969
network is not always stable on sun name

39
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,008
server may become unresponsive

40
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:01,949
occasionally so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if the</font>

41
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">cache resolvers can detect the end</font>

42
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,479
responsive name server and even can

43
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,788
detect the recovery of those are

responsive name server

45
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,629
so we have tested five different

to Cashman's hours and all these tests

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,730
occasionally lovers use their default

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one domain so we choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

66
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,920

the dot-com server we also set up name

server for the second-level domain so

74
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,549
that and we use the world card so that

<font color="#CCCCCC">for discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first scenario we</font>

98
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:03,240
see on the road trip time to each name

99
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:08,259

over can detect the end responsive name

the kashi lover can detect the recovery

108

155
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,919

159
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,610
it also distribute a lot of courage to

180
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:13,410
better or not what it can do is just

00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:16,260
uniformly distribute queries to all

182
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,569
those nameservers and for the ambulant

m1 does measure the round-trip time of

206
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,160
our measurement results just that this

algorithm does not take<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects so we</font>

208
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:30,439
try to answer why so here are let's look

209
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,480
at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben Nye a select the name server</font>

210
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,220
the graph all right our shows how the

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,100
round-trip time as the medieval

212
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,250
round-trip time of a name server varies

213
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,980
in the pan 98 actually it varies

214
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:48,390
periodically and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period consists of</font>

215
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,399
three phases so in the first to face the

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,130
estimated round-trip time keep the king

217
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll keep decreasing and two it becomes</font>

218
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,569
the least one so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this name</font>

another<font color="#E5E5E5"> phase that is the selected face</font>

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,199
and in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> place this name server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

been updated by the coming responses

226
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:18,490
from that server so that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> estimating</font>

00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:26,649
the third phase that is the update face

230
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:28,929
so in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> space the estimated</font>

231
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">round-trip time we are keeping our cake</font>

232
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:36,160
being updated by following responses so

233
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:39,699
that until there is no outstanding Paris

234
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,809
to that name server so we can notice

235
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:46,179
that in this 336 only in the selected

236
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,819
phase the server can be selected so

237
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:52,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of queries into this</font>

238
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:54,519
name server can be proportional to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">Richer of the midst of the selected face</font>

240
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,889
and the length<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the whole period and</font>

241
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:04,360
to note that list of the selected face

242
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:08,559
and and the list of the update space is

243
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,019
about one round-trip time so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

244
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,819
takes the list of the decaying<font color="#E5E5E5"> face that</font>

245
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:18,429
can determine how many queries will be

246
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:22,360
sent to the slower server um however in

247
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:25,869
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pad 98 the decaying speed is coupled</font>

248
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,540
with the power rate so that means if

249
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:31,179
Lacroix rate is higher than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Astarte</font>

250
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">T were decaying faster so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

251
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:35,920
getting to shutter the<font color="#CCCCCC"> king's face and</font>

252
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:40,899
more queries will be sent to the slower

253
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:44,199
server and to verify hours speculation

254
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:47,499
we redo our measurement under a lower

255
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:51,160
coverage so in this case we reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

256
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:56,139
power rate from 250 queries per second

257
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:58,480
to 25 queries per second so now we got

258
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,089
lower power rate and the Astarte

259
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,610
estimated round trip time decays slower

260
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:08,670
and we got a longer decaying phase so

261
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">few require</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> represent to the</font>

262
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,880
lower server so as the result on rice

263
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:19,560
shoes most of queries will be sent to

264
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,590
the fastest name server so now we need

265
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,449
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider the factors that caused the</font>

266

267
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:33,090

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kashmiris that if the wizard does</font>

not have a large cache or the result of

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,850
a lot of user then it probably generate

271
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:45,330
a lot of queries in a short time and at

272
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,210
the domain said if the TTA of the DNS

273
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:51,020

expect that this name server will wait a

294
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,119
long time to decay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the least one</font>

295
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,160
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be queried again</font>

296
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,440
however this assumption is not true when

297
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quarter rate is high and the decay</font>

298
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:06,810
speed is faster so in some well<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

299
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,540
gain speed is very faster sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

300
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:12,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsive name server may need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

301
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">only a few milliseconds to be selected</font>

302
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:18,060
again and the worst thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that once</font>

303
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,030
this name server this I'll responsive

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:24,490
conectate it will keep being selected

306
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,340
and to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> queries timeout timer get</font>

307
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,590
expelled and<font color="#CCCCCC"> neroli</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the value of the car</font>

308
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,680
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout timer is three or four</font>

309
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,440
seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that means a risk a</font>

310
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,810
responsive<font color="#CCCCCC"> name server only needs to</font>

311
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,420
wait a few milliseconds to be selected

312
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,939
but once it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been selected it will</font>

313
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,689
keep being selected for several seconds

314
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,670
so that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see that 98 send a</font>

315
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,870
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of courage to the air responsive</font>

316
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:55,510
name server so now let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how the</font>

317
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,330
other cash flow meat lovers handle those

318
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,380
and responsive name server so the first

319
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:04,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">way is parting asked as we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font>

320
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,380
Pardoner's shipped all those queries

321
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,990
from the first name server to the second

322
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:14,530
so in this case this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> a result is</font>

323
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:17,710
because parting as use a very very slow

324
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:20,050
decaying speed so the unresponsive name

325
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:24,160
server needs to wait about three minutes

326
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:27,729
to be selected again and for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N bond</font>

327
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,250
on Evan can detect the air responsive

328
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:33,040
name server and once a name server is

329
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,710
detected as a responsive and bound used

330
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,120
only a few are ways to crop that name

331
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:42,610

windows thing as it can't attack the

337

unresponsive name server and cowboys and

338
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:02,710
inquiries to it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> for those on named</font>

occasionally lovers that can detect on

340
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:11,170
the unresponsive name server we want to

341
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,030
see how long and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the check to detect</font>

342
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:17,380
the recovery of those armies count

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:20,500
unresponsive<font color="#CCCCCC"> name server and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4am bond it</font>

344
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,560
may takes up to 15 minutes to detect

345
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,380
that on actually the 15 minutes is the

346
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,480
interval between two consecutive probes

347
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,630
that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent to the</font>

348
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,840
responsive name server and for parting

349
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:37,540
as the time is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about three minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

350
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,320
this is a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his slow decay in</font>

speed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ferb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually the time</font>

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,990
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power rate so as you have</font>

353
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,809
seen before if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority is high a</font>

354
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,610
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress will be sent to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> air</font>

355
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:54,460
responsive name server so it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

356
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:59,080
for them to detect the server recovery

357
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:02,470
however if the query rate is low on then

358
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">the band may need to may need a long</font>

359
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,169
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> select</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Army's passive name</font>

360
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:11,380

361
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:15,130
detect the recovery and for windows

362
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:19,750
thing as I may take about 1 seconds to

363
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:29,080
discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recovery now here is</font>

364
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:34,120
conclusion this is wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so we start</font>

365
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:38,340
our measurement results we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

366
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:41,080
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement a casual observer a</font>

367
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,629
comprehensive test is needed because

368
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:49,120
some similar sound algorithm may not

369
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:55,030
work as expected however<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flick for</font>

370
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:57,969
example the Astarte decaying cannot work

371
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,309
as we expected the purpose of a certain

372
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,270
age care is to help the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cashmere lover</font>

373

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> carry those unselected nameserver</font>

374
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:09,940

that the authority came for the cash<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

378
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,559
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can now treat the unresponsive</font>

379
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,689
name server as the responsive name

380
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,760
server but with a large estimating

381
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,980
round-trip time because once the

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,110
unresponsive name server is<font color="#E5E5E5"> selected it</font>

387
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,940
are a sick sick is significant so once

388
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have discovered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some unresponsive</font>

responsive name server will still

393
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:07,580
attract a lot of queries are from those

394
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:12,920
record on nameservers yeah I think

395
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:14,840
that's it thank you sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the slice</font>

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:24,490
inconsistency we have questions

399
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:34,200
hi Eric casi se I perceived that there

400
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:38,160
was some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of surprise or puzzlement</font>

401
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,640
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt saw or the server selection</font>

402
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,400
changed between 97 and 98<font color="#CCCCCC"> or is it still</font>

403
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,740
unknown as to why is it still unknown to

404
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,640
as to why that<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed or that there was</font>

405
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,880
a change so I sorry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't get your</font>

406
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,220
question the question is is is it is the

407
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,800
puzzle to you that there was a change

408
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:03,870
between 97 and 98 for how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt</font>

409
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:08,580
handling worked no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the change</font>

410
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:13,050
between 97 and 98 it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

411
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:15,960
acrosome that nice aight used I so you

412
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:20,040
can out-trick the unresponsive

413
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:24,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">nameserver are as responsive what and</font>

414
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:28,860
also you cannot select<font color="#CCCCCC"> out name server</font>

415
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:34,560
oh you cannot couple the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arbor rates</font>

416
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:37,169
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> decadence babe yeah well I just</font>

417
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,879
well as look watching your presentation

418
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,740
I just looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the release notes and</font>

419
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,420
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> select that there are still</font>

420
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,510
questions it's actually in the release

421
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:51,080
notes is to the algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed and</font>

422
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:53,879
here's why so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the</font>

423
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:58,409
change between that because on the

424
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:03,060
change between been 97 and 98 is of that

425
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:05,520
bad 98 removes the bond<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by nice</font>

426
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,379
ever used to have but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't help</font>

427
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to solve this problem because you have</font>

428
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:13,500
you have seen if there are some are

429
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:15,480
responsive nameserver both been 97<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIH</font>

430
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,580
will send a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of queries to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsive name server and that's</font>

432
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:24,409
because the way Ben treat those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

433
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsive name server is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

434
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,280
we should separate the processing and

435
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,080
responsive name server and the

436
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,570
responsive name server in different way

437
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,490
yeah

438
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:37,470
I'm Matt Larsen from from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berra Steinem</font>

439
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,960
and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with India and this I</font>

440
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,480
mean Eric we we are aware that the

441
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,800
algorithm change from 972 98 and we

442
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,650
understand that the release notes say

443
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,480
that but the point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yugi's research</font>

444
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,429
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he discovered is that perhaps</font>

445
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,230
there's this unaffected side effect of a

446
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:53,910
unexpected<font color="#CCCCCC"> side effect of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font>

447
00:22:52,230 --> 00:23:00,500
algorithm that's all we're pointing out

448
00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:00,500
all right we'll look into it I'm sure

449
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,530
sorry I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was can ask a</font>

450
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,600
question Michael Sinatra energy sciences

network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick comment I actually</font>

452

453

version of slides that went in here

454
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,590
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really liked that last slide</font>

455
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,510
on implications for operators I think

456
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,429
it's really useful for us to understand

457
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:24,520
what happens one of our authoritative

458
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,630
name servers goes down so you know just

459
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,430

462
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,389
