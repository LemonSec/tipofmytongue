00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:06,390
hi I'm Eric West row and from the

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,860
University of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan and not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,750
Waterloo unfortunately well in any case

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,989
I'm going to be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about telex</font>

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,750
which is doesn't have much of a relation

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,850
to the our generous sponsor except I

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:28,320
guess we have a levenshtein distance of

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:29,640
one so without<font color="#CCCCCC"> further ado so the</font>

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,149
problem that we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,540
is one of government<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet censorship</font>

11
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,030
and this is really a global problem it's

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,920
not just concentrated in a handful of

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,129
countries like you've probably heard of

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">China and maybe even Iran but it's</font>

15
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,699
really spread across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,160
sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different countries sensors for</font>

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,989
lots of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons so some do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,989
for political<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons they they they</font>

19
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opposition in their</font>

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,629
in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> politics some do it do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,820
pornography censorship some even just

22
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,459
you know gay and lesbian dating sites

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,770
are banned and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's also a lot of</font>

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,559
religious<font color="#CCCCCC"> center ship to so this is a</font>

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,890
really widespread problem and and we're

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,570
trying to attack this from we're trying

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to attack the problem of government</font>

28
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet censorship so pretty widespread</font>

29
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,119
problem and so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did these government</font>

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,580
censors work well they they basically

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,080
all use a blacklist approach there are a

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,259
few that that use other techniques but

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,630
the main technique that we've seen is is

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,090
a lot of black lists where they go out

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,679
and they find offensive content or

36
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,570
whatever offensive means for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,110
that's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the pornography or or</font>

38
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,939
political stuff and it's an from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,619
technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> level they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically use these</font>

40
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,339
three techniques which is IP blocking

41
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,960
DNS spoofing and forge reset packets and

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,500
so the IP blocking is fairly

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,329
straightforward they block websites IPS

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,540
they'll do<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS injection they'll poison</font>

45
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,089
DNS queries with with bad IP addresses

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,969
for things like facebook com or<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

47
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,950
and they also do some deep packet

48
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,508
inspection and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a search</font>

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,819
query or something like that over the

50
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,470
clear for a band search term they'll

51
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,709
send a reset packet to both sides of

52
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,670
connection and<font color="#CCCCCC"> close it and you've</font>

53
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,990
probably heard of some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,450
countermeasures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people have tried</font>

55
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,120
for many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get around this type</font>

56
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,209
of censorship so you've heard of VPNs or

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,700
tour free net and ultrasurf but the

58
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,280
problems with those types of proxies is

59
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,579
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate that the</font>

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,440
proxies location to the citizens without

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,940
communicating it to the sensors because

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,770
if the sensors find out about it and

63
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't want their citizens accessing</font>

64
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,010
these proxies they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just block them</font>

65
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,740
using the same techniques that they're

66
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">using to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block the websites so it's a</font>

67
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,540
very cat and mouse game<font color="#CCCCCC"> between between</font>

68
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sensors and and the users and the</font>

69
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,959
people running the proxies and and so

70
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,620
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of effort on everyone's part</font>

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,040
and so just to illustrate this a little

72
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,640
further I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to quickly go through tor</font>

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,040
and Torres<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a is a proxy that was</font>

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,750
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anonymity so it's it's not</font>

75
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,450
an anti-censorship proxy although it is

76
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,760
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for anti-censorship it was</font>

77
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,390
primarily designed as an anonymity

78
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,609
providing proxy and how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is say</font>

79
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> alice wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob without</font>

80
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,560
Bob knowing that alice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is talking to Bob</font>

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,870
well Alice will contact the tour

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,030
directory servers and say hey I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

83
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,030
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the tour nodes and in the</font>

84
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,680
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the Tor network if you will</font>

85
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,890
and and once Alice gets all of those

86
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,070
knows she'll pick three nodes that that

87
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,018
she likes and use those as a proxy and

88
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,940
social she'll establish a connection to

89
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,910
the first one use that connection to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,160
first one as a proxy to talk to a second

91
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,590
tour node and again use that tunneled

92
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,900
connection to the second node to talk to

93
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,230
a third node and finally use that

94
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,480
tunneled third hot proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to Bob</font>

95
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,840
and you can see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an anonymous</font>

96
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,760
protocol because no single tour node can

97
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,160
tell both that Alice and Bob are

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,959
communicating only the first tour node

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,609
knows that alice is even talking to tour

100
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,040
but doesn't know where she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going the</font>

101
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,690
last tour node only knows that someone

102
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,168
in the tour node is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Bob in</font>

103
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle tour node knows nothing but</font>

104
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,079
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sensor to block</font>

105
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,849
this right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these tour</font>

106
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,409
nodes are public so so someone like

107
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">China just goes to the tour directory</font>

108
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,680
server and says

109
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,390
give me all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short directory</font>

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,630
servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to connect to tour</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

111
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and then adds all of those ip's</font>

112
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,640
their block list and all of those are

113
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">now blocked in china so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tour has an</font>

114
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,210
answer for this they've come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,890
something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour bridges which you</font>

116
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,289
may may have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

117
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:48,469
is that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to create some</font>

118
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,600
nodes that are not public these are

119
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,490
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just hidden bridges these are</font>

120
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,440
at or nodes just like any other node you

121
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,380
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to them and they act as as</font>

122
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,840
as tour entry nodes but they're not

123
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,140
publicized in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public tour directory</font>

124
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">list but again we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get these two</font>

125
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,130
are nodes or these tour bridges IP

126
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,320
addresses to citizens in the censored

127
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,150
countries and so they have a number of

128
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,030
mechanisms for doing this this is just

129
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,679
one of them you can go to bridges or

130
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,780
project org<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll give you three</font>

131
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,580
and you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask again they'll</font>

132
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,190
probably give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the same three until</font>

133
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,140
you change IP addresses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

134
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,020
number of attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allow people to</font>

135
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,080
to enumerate these tour bridges and

136
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,430
these are actually pretty effective at

137
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,560
enumerated the several hundred tour

138
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,210
bridges that are out there and and to

139
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,280
the point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> China has done this and</font>

140
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,669
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not alone in doing this</font>

141
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,539
and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to use tor in China</font>

142
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:47,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">despite this this add-on to tour it's</font>

143
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:53,270
really unreliable and most of these tour

144
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,400
bridges are blocked so our approach is

145
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,030
is fundamentally different we're looking

146
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,080
at this from an anti-censorship from the

147
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,309
beginning we're not trying to do

148
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,130
anonymity we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

149
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,660
anti-censorship from the start and we we

150
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,710
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of arrived at the idea that we</font>

151
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,750
should put a proxy in the network we

152
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,609
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is this is a lot harder</font>

153
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,310
to block than something that's that's

154
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,810
end to end or just IP base where you're

155
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,680
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some IP address that can</font>

156
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,970
easily be blocked or something like that

157
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,850
so we're focusing on avoiding detection

158
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,380
and and and we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

159
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,060
complements something like tor it's not

160
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,500
like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to beat out tour or</font>

161
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,360
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

162
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:37,310
a different direction and the main thing

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
about our system is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

164
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,400
secrets there's nothing that that is

165
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,960
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all</font>

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,120
the users of the system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

167
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,680
sensor everything is public the sensor

168
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,690
can know exactly how our system works

169
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,550
all of the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is involved in our</font>

170
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,250
system and still have a difficult time

171
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:57,470
blocking it or preventing access from

172
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,940
users so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font>

173
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,289
threat model that we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at just</font>

174
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,199
so we can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear what we're talking</font>

175
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:04,909
about we make basically three basic

176
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,190
assumptions about the sensor in question

177
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,470
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again the government level</font>

178
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,289
sensor this is the China or Iran or or

179
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,090
name your favorite country that's doing

180
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:18,440
censorship which is probably any of them

181
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,119
and so the first assumption we make is

182
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,949
that the sensor controls their network

183
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,289
right they control all of the the

184
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,580
routers in their country but they don't

185
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,530
control routers outside their country

186
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,270
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be they can buy hosting or VPNs</font>

187
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,549
outside their country but not you know

188
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,740
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't own large infrastructure now</font>

189
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,380
the second assumption we make is that

190
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensor is again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this blocking</font>

191
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,419
based on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> black list so they're they're</font>

192
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,150
looking out for we use the example

193
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,680
blocked<font color="#CCCCCC"> com is the website that the</font>

194
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,780
sensor says that has some offensive

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,580
content we're going to block that so if

196
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,239
you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access block com from inside</font>

197
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its blood on the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

198
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,610
not blocked com doesn't have any

199
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,400
offensive content on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so you can</font>

200
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that from inside the country</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

201
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,138
finally we make the assumption that the

202
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:08,270
sensor will allow https connections to

203
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,210
these non blocked sites and there's a

204
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,590
lot of reasons why they would do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

205
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,870
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of websites moving toward</font>

206
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,880
HTTPS there's something over one and a

207
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,820
half million websites on the internet

208
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:23,690
now that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> serving valid scientific</font>

209
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:26,419
'it's and lots of these are logins for

210
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,099
sites you know email a lot of e-commerce

211
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,919
and so it would really hurt the local

212
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:35,319
economy and among other things if they

213
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">were to just outright block</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS</font>

214
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,419
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font>

215
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">overview of how telex works in this</font>

216
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,290
threat model and and then we'll drill

217
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:49,310
down into some of the details a little

218
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:51,560
later so again the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client here is on</font>

219
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,899
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left and is trying to get to</font>

220
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,819
this blocked<font color="#CCCCCC"> com but the sensor here</font>

221
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,980
this gray wall is blocking this

222
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:03,339
connection because block com has some

223
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:05,839
offensive content so instead the user is

224
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:09,079
really wanting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get here so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user</font>

225
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,370
downloads at the Telex client binary and

226
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:11,930
they could have gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from perhaps</font>

227
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,670
a trusted friend or<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe an</font>

228
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,529
intermittently available proxy you know

229
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,819
tour was up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes today or</font>

230
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that and they used it to</font>

231
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">download telex and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're going</font>

232
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to install this on their computer which</font>

233
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to intercept their requests to</font>

234
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:30,949
block calm and instead generate an HTTPS

235
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:32,360
connection to not block<font color="#CCCCCC"> com and this is</font>

236
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:35,180
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course allowed by the censor because</font>

237
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,730
it's an unblocked website and its HTTPS

238
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:42,920
sure why not and the connection goes

239
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:45,230
through now inside this HTTPS connection

240
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,410
the Telex client is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to place an</font>

241
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,810
invisible tag and this invisible tag is

242
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,300
constructed in a special way that the

243
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,410
sensor cannot see it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

244
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">about more of the details of this</font>

245
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,350
invisible tag later but along the path

246
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,529
along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connection path between</font>

247
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user and not blocked com there's a</font>

248
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:07,399
number of routers and along one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

249
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:10,279
routers outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sensors country</font>

250
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,829
we place a telex station and this is our

251
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,290
proxy that we're placing at some ISPs

252
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:17,540
router and this position in the network

253
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,390
allows us to see the packets going

254
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:24,890
between the client and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocked calm</font>

255
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:27,260
and most importantly see the invisible

256
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,610
tag that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in this connection and the</font>

257
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,410
way we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do that is because</font>

258
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,360
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a private key in the Telex</font>

259
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,089
station that the sensor does not have

260
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,959
and this private key is is associated

261
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,550
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this tag and people with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the public</font>

262
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,699
portion of this can generate tags but

263
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,979
not check to see if tags exist but only

264
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:50,140
the private key<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see these tags exist</font>

265
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,230
and so once this happens the the Telex

266
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,180
client is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> place inside this</font>

267
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:58,450
HTTPS connection the request for blocked

268
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,189
calm and because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the private key in</font>

269
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,200
the in metallic station we're able to

270
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,680
decrypt<font color="#E5E5E5"> this request and only we are</font>

271
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,810
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decrypt this request and proxy</font>

272
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,180
it for the user and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we send this</font>

273
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:13,420
request to block<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm to the proxy</font>

274
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,310
server and get the response and when we

275
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,329
send data back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the user we actually</font>

276
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,399
spoof it from not<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocked calm and in</font>

277
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:24,779
re-encrypt it and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it so</font>

278
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:28,390
to the sensor this looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly like an</font>

279
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:31,839
innocuous HTTPS connection to not block

280
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm so there's there's there's a lot of</font>

281
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,130
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on here there's deep packet</font>

282
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,510
inspection there's man in the middle but

283
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,029
we're using this for anti-censorship

284
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,170
instead of censorship which is what

285
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:44,800
those techniques have been used for

286
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,769
previously so you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> say at this</font>

287
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,240
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well why would an ISP in the</font>

288
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,440
right mind deploy something like this

289
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,750
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right this is this is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of crazy</font>

290
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,730
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think there's any single</font>

291
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,620
reason why I don't have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

292
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,779
reason that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can convince you all that</font>

293
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,180
you should all deploy telex at your ISPs

294
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,040
today but I think there's there's

295
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,040
there's some good arguments for it for

296
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,469
some ISPs that could be convincing for

297
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,930
some of them so one is to advance the

298
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,699
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of art of research and what we're</font>

299
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,640
looking at is things like deep packet

300
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:22,599
inspection and man-in-the-middle attacks

301
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,920
but for good and steganography and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

302
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font>

303
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,620
motivating reason for a lot of research

304
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,570
oriented is ps2 to be looking at

305
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,670
something like this there's also a

306
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:38,260
government incentives our government<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

307
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:41,019
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many others has previously sent</font>

308
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,300
money toward anti-censorship proxy use

309
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:49,180
and projects like this so there's some

310
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:51,939
potential funding there and finally the

311
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,680
ISPs are really in a unique position to

312
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,760
help in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this instance and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

313
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of powerful motivator at</font>

314
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
least for me in terms of working on this

315
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,880
project is

316
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,150
is that the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really designed</font>

317
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,180
as an open Technology and the censorship

318
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:11,000
is very counter to that and and this

319
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,370
type of technology is as telex is the

320
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,200
technology that sort of counters that

321
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:19,880
counter so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit</font>

322
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,279
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the finer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grained details</font>

323
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,830
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly telex needs and what</font>

324
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,900
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> telex would require from an ISP</font>

325
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,400
deployment and and and to do that I have

326
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,069
to talk a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about the lower</font>

327
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,569
layers of how we work and so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

328
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,190
this all over TLS so you have to

329
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,460
understand a little bit about TLS and

330
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,680
I'll walk a little bit through how TLS

331
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,490
works briefly but essentially when you

332
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,779
create a TLS connection this is over<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

333
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,460
you send a number of messages back and

334
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:49,460
forth between the client and server and

335
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,760
this establishes a cure channel between

336
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,370
the client and server so the first

337
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,560
message in the TLS handshake is normally

338
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,150
the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> to low message and inside the</font>

339
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,920
client hello message there's this knots

340
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,319
that is designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect against</font>

341
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,660
replay attacks normally this nonces

342
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,790
chosen randomly by the client but in

343
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,030
telex we replace this knots with our

344
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:13,459
invisible tag so it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

345
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,530
location<font color="#CCCCCC"> for our invisible tag and again</font>

346
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,420
this invisible tag can only be seen by

347
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telex station with the telex</font>

348
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,290
stations private key it can't be seen by

349
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:26,959
the sensor and it can't even be seen by

350
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:29,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nahuatl com so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using the the private</font>

351
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,310
key the italic station observes this and

352
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,089
says oh I will need to do some proxying

353
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,949
for this this connection another message

354
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's sent in the in the TLS exchange</font>

355
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,600
is the the key exchange and this is what

356
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,110
establishes the shared secret between

357
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tell the client and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the server that</font>

358
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,850
they use for encrypting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

359
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,319
authenticating all of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

360
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,680
normally the client chooses a random

361
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">value for its key exchange and does some</font>

362
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,880
math and sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the server but on</font>

363
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,430
our case we're replacing that random

364
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,500
value with a shared secret that was

365
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,640
communicated to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Telex station inside</font>

366
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,860
the invisible tag and so this allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

371
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,829
decrypt that TLS connection between

372
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,390
client and server now<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember this</font>

373
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,940
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on just you know normal TLS</font>

374
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,100

375
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak this information to the Telex</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to man in the middle connections that</font>

378
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:42,459
want to be men<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the middle in this</font>

379
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:44,720
fashion and so finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Telex station</font>

380
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,580
makes sure that it has gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

381
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,960
math right and it looks at the finished

382
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,830
message which is an encrypted and

383
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,860
authenticated digest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> previous</font>

384
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,510
messages in the in the handshake and

385
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,640
once it has verified that yes it indeed

386
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,800
does have the shared secret between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

387
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,710
server and the client it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an</font>

388

389
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually receive all of the the</font>

391
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,310
they are and we can spoof<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not</font>

393
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,510
the way back and so at this point the

394
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,359
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends the get request for blocked</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">calm encrypted with the shared secret of</font>

396
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:28,250
the TLS connection so how does this

397
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,680
invisible tagging work right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

398
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,600
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the secret sauce of this whole</font>

399
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is how do we keep this this the</font>

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,550
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag secret from the sensor but</font>

401

anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is able to generate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and and</font>

402
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,569
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we</font>

403
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,579

414
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,770
because it's replacing a random<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font>

415
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,420
and so the sensor can look at the

convey a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short shared shared secret</font>

430
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,420
with was using diffie-hellman<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

432
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,800
the math details of how all this works

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,080
if you're interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that please yes</font>

434
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,820
after perhaps during lunch or<font color="#CCCCCC"> read our</font>

435
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,629
research paper there's plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of details</font>

436
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:57,620
there but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an application of</font>

437
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">public-key steganography so we have a</font>

438
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,320
working prototype at this point and

439
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,300
we've been running<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out of our lab</font>

440
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,090
at the University<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Michigan I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

441
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,820
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go quickly through what we've</font>

coming months and this year in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

444
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,100
of actually getting this deployed and

445
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,810
and scaled up so i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with the</font>

446
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,480
Telex station it has basically three

447
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,950
components it has a flow diversion a tag

448
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,500
of recognition and a proxy service

449
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,630
component the flow diversion component

450
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,390
is is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bump in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wire it's</font>

451
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,790
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inline switch in the ISP if you</font>

452
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,380
will and it gets to see all the traffic

453
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:39,480
between the client and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the not blocked</font>

454
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:41,880
websites and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that</font>

455
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">when telex was under load or under</font>

461
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:59,880
this router is able to be commanded to

462
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,670
block flows once the tag recognition

463
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,090
sees something that it that it notices

464
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:08,550
is a telex connection so in in that mode

465
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,760
the tag recognition falling on the floor

466
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:14,280
or getting you know rebooted or denial

467
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,020
of service is not going to impede

468
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,670
regular traffic regular traffic is

469
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,310
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to flow through the</font>

470
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,540
router and not have to go through the

471
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:27,450
bottleneck<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our deep packet inspection</font>

472
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:28,950
or anything like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so the tag</font>

473
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,200
recognition is the thing that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

below the the flow diversion and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,980
see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the packets going through if</font>

476
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,870
it can keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and command the</font>

477
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,730
flow diversion to yes this is a telex

478
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,489
flow I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this more</font>

479
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,470
closely and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has to do all the</font>

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,750
deep packet inspection the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp flow</font>

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:53,520
reconstruction the extracting of the TLS

482
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:54,990
nonce and etc etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> and finally we have</font>

483
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,820
sort of the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> component is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

484
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,679
obvious proxy service component so this

485
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,409
is the actual what we forward this

486
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:03,450
traffic to once we decrypt it and what

487
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,370
we get traffic back from that we have to

488
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,890
re-encrypt and spoof is not blocked calm

489
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:12,570
and we implemented three different proxy

490
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:14,700
services one a squid HTTP proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> 28 or</font>

491
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,730
bridge so you can use tor on top of

492
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:25,290
telex and also an ssh server that only

493
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:29,510
accepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH logins over telex and from</font>

494
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:32,550
the the client side we have a small

495
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,809
source distribution of code that's

496
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,169
available for both windows and linux

497
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:40,050
that you can run<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your computer that</font>

498
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically acts as a local HTTP proxy for</font>

499
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,250
your browser and redirects all of the

500
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,290
requests through these encrypted

501
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:51,840
connections to not block calm and our

502
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,149
test deployment we have like I said a

503
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">very small ISP that has all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of two</font>

504
00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:00,150

508
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,110
any content provider or country that I

509
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,510
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can think of and the second one is</font>

510
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">a blocked telex CC which simulates a</font>

511
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,700
blocked website and we simulated that by

512
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,390
making it only accessible from users of

513
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,370
telex and three of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authors on our</font>

514
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,929
paper used telex for their daily

515
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,739
browsing for a few months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font>

516
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">using it since July personally and been</font>

517
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,390
able to have minimal complaints of the

518
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">complaints that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did have usually</font>

519
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,820
resulted in bug fixes so you know that's

520
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,649
always good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were able to stream</font>

521
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,780
high-definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube videos from a</font>

522
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">planet lab node in Beijing China and</font>

523
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:48,960
Beijing and China actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocks</font>

524
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:50,580
youtube so this was something that was

525
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,590
kind of nice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to prove that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

526
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:56,240
we were high bandwidth enough to handle

527
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,240
high definition you too

528
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:01,929
and in in in China's case actually once

529
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,658
we release this we had a lot of support

530
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:08,020
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of Chinese users using our</font>

531
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:09,760
service and our proxy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately the</font>

532
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,610
Chinese government decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to block not</font>

533
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,289
block telex DC which was sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

534
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,168
entertaining first they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with DNS</font>

535
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:19,330
blocking and then we said oh we can get

536
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:23,500
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you guys can now use not</font>

537
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:25,779
really blocked telex<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC and within a day</font>

538
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,700
they had they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS blocked that as</font>

539
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:29,169
well and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> people acted as well it was</font>

540
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,909
they were they were you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know quickly</font>

541
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,710
escalating this too we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

542
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:34,899
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing this game with you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys go</font>

543
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,760
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you look at not blocked at</font>

544
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:38,678
tillek so you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really have to</font>

545
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,240
wonder why did the Chinese<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

546
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,250
sensor this right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is a</font>

547
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:49,270
really in oculus website it's just it's

548
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:53,700
just kittens served over HTTPS so so I

549
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:56,440
sent a complaint to abuse set at CN Nick

550
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,720
asking why my popular kittens web site

551
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,880
was blocked in their country and and why

552
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had not had any more users from their</font>

553
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:10,360
country in the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> days and I'm</font>

554
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:12,279
still waiting to hear back from them so

555
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,049
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is the users around the</font>

556
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,970
world from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first three weeks of our</font>

557
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:19,379
deployment obviously it was pretty what

558
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:22,299
worldwide which was great for our

559
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,610
evaluation and testing of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our system and</font>

560
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:28,899
it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shifted more recently to a</font>

561
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:30,610
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> China and and India is a lot of</font>

562
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:33,539
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users but we've had over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy</font>

563
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">five thousand users since launch and</font>

564
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:41,980
that's been pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting for us to</font>

565
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:43,539
run a small proxy for them so next step

566
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this is what we're looking for from</font>

567
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,950
this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess and and and this</font>

568
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:50,770
community in general is is that we're

569
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,750
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for partners to move to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">level which is to actually deploy this</font>

571
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,409
at a real ISP so that we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

572
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:57,640
single website that's hosting kittens

573
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets blocked by the Chinese</font>

574
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,690
government we want to have thousands of

575
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,100
websites behind it on which will make

576
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,720
them really think you know well should

577
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,459
we really block all these websites and

578
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,870
and it

579
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,750
might make the collateral damage for

580
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:16,279
blocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much much more difficult</font>

581
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:19,500
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to do and so so from for a</font>

00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:22,440
direct what we actually need from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ISP</font>

583
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to deploy it in isp as we're looking for</font>

584
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically a TCP tap off of port 443 and</font>

585
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,010
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> inline open flow switch and we're</font>

586
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,658
currently developing an open flow

587
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,059
extension that will allow us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

588
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:42,600
this sort of man in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> egg and</font>

589
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:43,770
tagged recognition of fast traffic so if

590
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,289
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're interested at all in</font>

591
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,779
talking to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> during lunch or during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:53,760
break please do<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we would be very</font>

593
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:56,340
happy to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to wrap up</font>

594
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,260
this has been our new approach to

595
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,779
resisting internet censorship and we've

596
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,730
been using a new technique which we call

597
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,740
n to middle proxying as opposed to

598
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,130
end-to-end proxying where you're using

599
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,720
IPS as proxies and we're focusing on

600
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">hiding the service we're not in a non</font>

601
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,529
emiti thing like tour but we're focusing

602
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,659
on making it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the sensor can't</font>

603
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:19,760
tell that users<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using this proxy and</font>

604
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:21,779
can't more importantly block this proxy

605
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,129
and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we have a proof of</font>

606
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:25,529
concept that's operating today I

607
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:29,520
encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all to go check it out our</font>

608
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:30,570
website is telex CC and thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

609
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,320
much I'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to answer any</font>

610
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions at this time</font>

611
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:48,830
hi Jake you an IV<font color="#E5E5E5"> infusion so you've</font>

612
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:51,690
told us about your efforts or about this

613
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,639
the benefits<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> receive benefit for</font>

614
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,700
deploying this I'm assuming you've had

615
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:59,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversations with other rsps rather</font>

616
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,229
than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one in Michigan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and could</font>

617
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:02,879
you share with us some of the reaction

618
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:05,779
from them and could you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us why it</font>

619
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:09,959
would be not beneficial to deploy this

620
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:11,759
so yeah that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh so one</font>

621
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,669
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that obviously we're putting an</font>

622
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,289
open flow switch in someone's production

623
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:18,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network and so people are obviously very</font>

624
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:20,369
nervous<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that sort of thing they're</font>

625
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:24,869
hesitant if you know this experimental

626
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:28,228
type thing would actually result in loss

627
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:29,639
of customers essentially traffic or

628
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:32,909
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that that might might</font>

629
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:34,349
screw up their internal network and we

630
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:36,539
have some ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

631
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:39,359
ISPs that that might help mitigate some

632
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:40,859
of that you could you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> only source</font>

633
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,149
us the traffic from some of these

634
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:43,349
censored countries that we care about

635
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:48,748
that you probably don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many</font>

636
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:50,519
customers or destinations in but I think

637
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:51,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now we haven't talked to too many</font>

638
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,179
isps we've only talked to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small</font>

639
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:58,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">handful and and and most of the ones</font>

640
00:26:54,179 --> 00:27:01,139
we've talked to have been sort of not

641
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:02,908
against it but they've been not you know

642
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:04,099
oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's deploy this tomorrow or</font>

643
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:06,539
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that they're sort of just</font>

644
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:07,950
hemming and hawing and sort of seeing

645
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:11,369
what will happen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font>

646
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,989
there's any huge disadvantage I mean

647
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:15,389
maybe some other people can come up with

648
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:17,190
some in this room for deploying this

649
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:20,549
sort of thing did you have any in mind

650
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,619
that well I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they gave any</font>

651
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:26,359
reason for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reluctance in particular</font>

652
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:29,519
with on the political economic financial

653
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,019
one was one of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most specific</font>

654
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones was that they were worried that</font>

655
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:38,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">their customers would be under a greater</font>

656
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,489
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being attacked by these</font>

657
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,590
countries and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't necessarily</font>

658
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:45,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with that statement but that was</font>

659
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,889
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was given from</font>

660
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,889
one of the ISPs we talked to

661
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">err coasting with network utility force</font>

662
00:27:52,790 --> 00:28:01,010
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't generally consider myself a tin</font>

663
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:02,810
foil<font color="#E5E5E5"> hat person mom but your your</font>

664
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,960
suggestion that there may be government

665
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:08,720
incentives associated with pulling this

666
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,020
work sent number of chills down my spine

667
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:15,370
perhaps you could tell us a bit about

668
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,500
any government involvement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been</font>

669
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:20,840
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project so far oh</font>

670
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:28,150
and what you might do to counteract

671
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:30,560
possible tampering yes so um yes your

672
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,720
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question we had no government</font>

673
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,899
funding from our project whatsoever from

674
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,770
any government or private organization

675
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,690
initially developing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

676
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,120
technology is is just developed at the

677
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,970
University<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Michigan and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> University of</font>

678
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">Waterloo and and there's no government</font>

679
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">involvement from that as far as</font>

680
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:52,280
government tampering is concerned yes is

681
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,200
this is a proxy the government could

682
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,139
potentially snoop on this like any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

683
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,360
proxy but if you're concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

684
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,160
we encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to run tour on top</font>

685
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,870
of telex if they're concerned about

686
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,090
anonymity like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

687
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,629
anonymity providing proxy this is for

688
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,629
anti-censorship

689
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,960
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little short on time</font>

690
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,729
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut it off the people at</font>

691
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,500
microphones next question from stage

692
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:21,080
right over here hi ipad<font color="#CCCCCC"> kun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you swim how</font>

693
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,850
do you come around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem if if for</font>

694
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:28,540
example let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with your vegging</font>

695
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:31,520
example so<font color="#E5E5E5"> beijing your proxy somehow</font>

696
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:34,040
this proxy or the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

697
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,370
actually your private key on this proxy

698
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,750
is exposed to China<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they do imagine</font>

699
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pen in the middle into the</font>

700
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,800
middle/middle yeah so what if our

701
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,590
private key gets compromised yes so we

702
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,240
have a number of mitigation techniques

703
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,429
for that that's in the paper one is to

704
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,080
use short-lived private keys and we can

705
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,120
have lots of public keys that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

706
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,740
one used every five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

707
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,139
like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that certainly makes it</font>

708
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,940
harder to compromise any single one you

709
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,670
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me afterward read the paper</font>

710
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">for more details on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next</font>

711
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:09,170
question from the gentleman in the Hat

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:10,820
good thanks Greg<font color="#E5E5E5"> Louis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix not that</font>

713
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,900
you're a lawyer but I'm wondering if you

714
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:17,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys have kicks discuss or explored of</font>

715
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:22,330
what risks there would be two isps or US

716
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:25,970
citizens getting hit by<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcma warrants</font>

717
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:28,610
from the use not<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorized used by US</font>

718
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,070
government of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> service so i'm not</font>

719
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure obviously I'm not a lawyer but I</font>

720
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,179
think it would be similar to other

721
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,709
proxies or VPNs that are proxying

722
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,030
traffic for people outside the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

723
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,550
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what they fall under</font>

724
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:46,030
but I assume we would be similar to that

725
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:50,180
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of questions one of them is</font>

726
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:54,410
somewhat technical abut oh okay Hannagan

727
00:30:50,180 --> 00:31:00,140
with the impulse what the somewhat

728
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:01,940
technical is 28 bite nonce if that is

729
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,950
indeed going to be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

730
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:10,180
triggers the<font color="#CCCCCC"> router to route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

731
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:12,560
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> X could not statistical analysis</font>

732
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,650
show that that is not random and these

733
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,419
nonces that are known would then be I

734
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean any message containing that knots</font>

735
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,610
would be censored yes the other question

736
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,340
is

737
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:28,760
how secure how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

738
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:32,090
Telex client itself is secure if non

739
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:35,240
blocked calm happens to be my bank and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

740
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,649
am running telex to avoid censorship I

741
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,340
don't particularly want a

742
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:42,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">man-in-the-middle in that transaction ok</font>

743
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,409
so the answer the first question the

744
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:49,629
invisible tags that are generated with

745
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:51,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">elliptic curve and hash outputs are</font>

746
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:53,120
indistinguishable from random and when I

747
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,070
say that that's computationally

748
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">indistinguishable from random if someone</font>

749
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,310
were able to distinguish that from

750
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:01,190
random they can do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other nasty</font>

751
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:03,110
things like reverse hashes or decrypt

752
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,150
elliptic curve encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

753
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,360
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are more details</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

754
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">our papers about that too to enter the</font>

755
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,800
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> question we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only men</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

756
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,870
middle Aang the connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your bank</font>

757
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,940
but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually user not to your</font>

758
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,439
bank put to the not blocked site and

759
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,150
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually using that</font>

760
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,560
connection to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to not blocked if you</font>

761
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,270
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to your bank you'd talk</font>

762
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your bank through telex and that</font>

763
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,960
connection would be end-to-end encrypted

764
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,940
intelex wouldn't be able to snoop on

765
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you additionally tag that as</font>

766
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,120
well

767
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:39,259
thanks a lot Eric
