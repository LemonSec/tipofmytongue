at every fall meeting so our next

dog as just good business practice

59
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,290
decided to undergo a voluntary financial

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">audit at the end of this week</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font>

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,079
not-for-profit status

64
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,540
we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was better to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at</font>

65
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,099
the very beginning rather than having to

66
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:14,700
correct things and now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will pass it on</font>

67
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,978
to Betty who will<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain the next month</font>

forward-looking plan for sustaining

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,049
nanog and growing nanog so all the

81
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,039
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of</font>

82
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,470
wanting to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a a set of</font>

83
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:04,979
new set of tools or new set of offerings

84
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,080
we throw all of those ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> out on the</font>

85
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,719
table as part of our retreat discussions

86
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,870
and then we come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a plan and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help us keep on track and to</font>

report<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of you how we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

89
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,950
to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information back to you as</font>

90
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,260
members so you're aware what we're

91
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,330
planning three years out you know right

92
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,340
now we're dealing with 18 months but

93
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,349
we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be really thinking you had</font>

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,690
three years as we think about

95
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:32,219
implementing these new ideas and bring

96
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,520
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you and so we can have a</font>

97
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,229
dialogue here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our member meetings we</font>

98
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,260
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a</font>

99
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:42,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">long term investment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can maintain all</font>

100
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the offerings so we think through the</font>

101
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,139
process of what we're wanting to do what

102
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,610
other nods are doing what we should be

103
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,030
doing and how they line up with

104
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,979
priorities and the important element of

105
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,090
what we think about when we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

106
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:03,240
strategic plan is the members you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

107
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:06,119
we have members we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you who</font>

108
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,900
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> making a core investment into</font>

109
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">nanigen we</font>

110
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,090
we want to respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and honor that</font>

111
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,639
and that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our drivers as with</font>

112
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:19,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">any company we want to achieve financial</font>

113
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,630
stability we weave physical stability we

114
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,970
want predictability we don't want to be

115
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,250
just thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is nana</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

116
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:29,039
money meeting to meeting but<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we have</font>

117
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">a reserve to sustain us annually and</font>

118
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,690
into the next year so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about a</font>

119
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,409
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to broaden</font>

120
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:39,570
the scope in size of our sponsor

121
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,880
contribution while<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintaining the look</font>

122
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,590
and feel of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana's principles so you</font>

123
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,919
know what nanog to become trade show

124
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:50,669
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> committed to the vendor neutral</font>

125
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,198
environment that you all enjoy and we

126
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,690
want to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you in our</font>

127
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,229
sponsorship model so that's a big driver

128
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:02,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about we want to be able</font>

129
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:04,949
to create exceptional support for our

130
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,289
vendors and operational efficiency we

131
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,090
don't want to have a lot of overhead for

132
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:11,639
our sponsors to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be here</font>

133
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,520
either for us or for them so we always

134
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,780
think about ways in which we can make it

135
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,180
easy for sponsors to participate and we

136
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,099
talk a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> now these days about making</font>

137
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,949
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can honor the deliverables</font>

138
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,320
that we've committed to giving you it's

139
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,440
an important business element and so

140
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,349
we're paying attention we want to build

141
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the unified branding message about what</font>

142
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:40,050
why is nanog unique and we all have an

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,139
opinion in a view and we're sharing that

144
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,780
in our collateral and in our message

145
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:49,979

152
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,840
rewarding agreements because we can

believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sponsorship model is very</font>

sure that it's a rewarding experience

156
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,599
for the

157
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:18,188
sponsors for them to come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> it still</font>

00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:29,679
financial stability means registration

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,310
450 people on average what would it mean

175
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:15,550
if we had 650 people and what would it

176
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,719
mean if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 303 members today and we</font>

177

tomorrow how are we going to get there

179
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,149
what's our value proposition so those

180
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some of the subjects that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

194
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:16,120
hard because we get busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board gets</font>

in

199
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,750
job is to sort of be that sideline voice

200
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,859
reminding them we have to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font>

201
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have to deal with some of these</font>

202
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">things because it's important for Nana</font>

203
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,620
and thus far as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the goals</font>

204
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,680
when we started this in September

205
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,920
through the summer we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,490
that we we made in our plan plan is only

208
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,680
so good unless you actually have some

209
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,200
metrics for success how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

to be successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we set some</font>

212
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:01,940
again metrics for whether we're

213
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:05,000

cycle which is January we have received

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,720
ninety-eight percent return rate so of

part of our planning that will bring

282
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,180
back to you in and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

283
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:21,730
membership about well<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you have a</font>

284
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,779
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're doing a lot of dreaming</font>

285
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:28,449
and we own<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's some risk right</font>

286
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:31,779
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about your risk and the</font>

287
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:35,529
risk is when we increase our sponsorship

288
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:41,439
or we increase our content or our

289
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:44,660
programming there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost associated with</font>

290
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:47,240
that right there's people behind

291
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:50,180
the scenes making things happen so we're

292
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,170
constantly also dealing with oh this

293
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:56,628
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this buddy</font>

294
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,029
says reality check it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's</font>

295
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:02,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what the impact of supporting</font>

296
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:04,600
it is so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not ignoring the</font>

297
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,189
risk of putting something in place

298
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,639
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very expensive for us</font>

299
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:12,500
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support we also recognize we're not</font>

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,779
the only network operators group in the

301
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,629
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's global competition</font>

302
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:20,480
not only in other operator groups but in

303
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:25,069
other professional organizations and we

304
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:28,790
can't be unaware of what they're all

305
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:30,740
doing and where we're at in terms of our

306
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:34,879
positioning and drawing your attention

just plan meeting to meeting we can't

revert to the old ways and we're

here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board and everyone on our</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">been good</font>

335
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,910
and it's been tough a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

336
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,380
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks but when we look at the</font>

337
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,780
financials when you look at the

338
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,420
financials that are available for you to

339
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,129
look at an arrow and when we as

340
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,950
committee members talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

341
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,589
these new ideas and relationships that

342
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:13,530
we're building it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting it's</font>

343
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,389
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting stuff instead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

344
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,339
the same old same old<font color="#E5E5E5"> same old kind of</font>

345
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,600
nanog we're really talking about

346
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:24,810
changing in creating a new future for us

347
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that there are rewards that</font>

348
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:30,810
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to see in that we we have</font>

349
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:34,470
the usual discussion we're six weeks out

350
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:37,590
from a meeting and we've spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

351
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">money on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this hotel and the registration</font>

352
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:44,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">number is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up like it 185 or 200 and</font>

353
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:49,140
we're going on my goodness but you know

354
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">what there's over 480 three of you here</font>

355
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,250
today so we must be doing something

356
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,870
right our our membership numbers are

357
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,330
growing our attendance numbers are

358
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,909
growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our sponsorship engagement</font>

359
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:03,330
is growing in your registration fee has

360
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:05,730
not increased so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the kind of</font>

361
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:11,720
attention that we're paying is paying

362
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:14,880
off and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also seeing is that</font>

363
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:21,360
nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> has grown up in that there's not</font>

364
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:23,490
as much negativity being discussed in

365
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,889
the mail<font color="#E5E5E5"> list about Nana but you're</font>

366
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,050
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about operator issues in the in</font>

367
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mail list so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's also another</font>

368
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:33,120
sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the list that we have that is</font>

369
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">critical to the operations of the</font>

370
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,399
internet is working and it's working to

371
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,820
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> real business of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

372
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,970
as opposed to just business of some of

373
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:49,260
the political isms of running Nana so I

374
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,940
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's also a bright future that's</font>

375
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,550
the strategic<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan that's where we're at</font>

376
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,920
as i said i know this is was very brief

377
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,419
and there are a lot of details that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

378
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,340
threw<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

379
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,250
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about as soon as it becomes</font>

380
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,159
more concrete

381
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,280
and we can share it with you we'll put

382
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,430
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on the website and we'll have both</font>

383
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,870
electronic and more conversation in June

384
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,870
with you at the next member<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

385
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:34,189
questions hello hmm well uh just<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 to</font>

386
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:37,070
introduce myself when I think yes all

387
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:42,440
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm my name is Dorian Kim from NTT</font>

388
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:45,409
America and I got a diamond sponsor yes

389
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:49,610
but I'm actually speaking as just a

390
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,740
member not as a sponsor in this case you

391
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,479
know all this growth numbers that you

392
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,480
talk about is great but I have specific

393
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">question about the sponsorship Jim you</font>

394
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,160
said that you know we've been even

395
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,050
growing the number of sponsors is that

396
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,450
specifically because you're looking for

397
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,340
diversity<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sponsorships</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font>

398
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,350
for sustainability or is it because that

399
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,510
original set of responses were not

400
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,629
meeting the financial requirements of

401
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:18,830
nanog it's because when we set the model

402
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,420
in place Dorian we didn't a year ago we

403
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,360
didn't know with certainty how much

404
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,280
money we needed to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana that's</font>

405
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,760
the reality of the situation we had an

406
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,220
idea of what we needed and we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

407
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,430
put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model in place that would help get</font>

408
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,050
an infusion of dollars quick because we

409
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,330
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any money to start with and</font>

410
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:42,320
so the investment from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the diamond</font>

411
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:44,750
sponsors was huge it was so critical to

412
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,379
be able to know that out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the gate</font>

413
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:50,750
three meetings ago we had vendors who

414
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">are willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to support that kind of</font>

415
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:56,630
money in investment nanog now what we've

416
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:59,180
done is spent serious time looking at

417
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,390
what does that sponsorship model<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

418
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,750
need to be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward not based on</font>

419
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:10,130
diversity you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in any of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

420
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:12,970
really from a financial model point of

421
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:15,909
view what's the what's the targeted doll

422
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,470
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to achieve then let</font>

423
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:20,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">me ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a question with this time with</font>

424
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:23,740
the sponsor hat on does that mean that

425
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,450
you should be repricing or reclassifying

426
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,539
the different levels tears of

427
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:31,780
sponsorship as in up the dollar

428
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:34,690
requirements there is a redefinition of

429
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,030
the model yes and what you will see in

430
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming days and on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the website</font>

431
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:41,260
through the development committee is

432
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,740
more details on what that new model for

433
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nana 56 and Beyond will be our first</font>

434
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,740
cycle ended with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting and we</font>

435
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,679
spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time right sizing that</font>

436
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,299
model and putting together a new model

437
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,960
that will take us through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next year</font>

438
00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:03,840
and I really think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is good for</font>

439
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:07,419
nanog and it is not painful for sponsors

440
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,850
the benefit of what we've done is well

441
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dorian is we've spent time making sure</font>

442
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:16,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we know what our commitment to you</font>

443
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:19,600
is and how we're going to deliver it so

444
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:22,450
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a gray area a trust</font>

445
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,120
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray area we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to honor that commitment that</font>

you're making for us go to us I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

448
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,379
can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the sponsorship</font>

449
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,020
stuff pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're offline okay thanks and</font>

450
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,530
income and see myself for Misaka Misaka

451
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,668
where are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Masako is right there</font>

452
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:43,120
she'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to talk to you about it</font>

453
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you you're welcome hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

454
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,689
Goulding with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rage of our data centers</font>

455
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,520
first I want to say I'm personally very

456
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,679
happy with the fact that sponsorships

457
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,620
have been been broadened because I got

458
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,919
to sponsor<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've</font>

459
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,000
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the sponsor signs you know</font>

460
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,590
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going wow that's a lot</font>

461
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,750
of sponsors and I think some people may

462
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,030
be concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

463
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,350
we've got nuts and you know certainly

464
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:08,399
you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how many there are</font>

465
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:10,889
but you know I I don't think it's it's

466
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,890
becoming reasonable I do think you can

467
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:16,170
charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more I wouldn't</font>

468
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,780
charge I wouldn't double it but I think

469
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:21,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still some distance you can go</font>

470
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,950
on increasing the charger sponsors<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

471
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that I would ask in return is a</font>

472
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:30,000
sponsor is continuing to professionalize

473
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:32,910
the sponsorship process so if you know I

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,640
pay 30 grand<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right time to</font>

475
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,950
kill me to be 50 only if the sponsorship

476
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,810
process becomes you know much more

477
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,810
seamless painless and

478
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,470
and look this looks much more like a

479
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,740
professional organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and much less</font>

480
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,510
like a network engineer striking<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

481
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">conference which is which is not a slap</font>

482
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,920
at any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us it's just one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

483
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do it sort of the quid pro</font>

484
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,660
quo absolutely the other comment I want

485
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,399
to make is I I think we're doing great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

486
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,920
think you guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a wonderful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

487
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,510
I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that you don't have 100</font>

488
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,900
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room have we're going</font>

489
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:13,020
here to to scream and yell and<font color="#E5E5E5"> freak out</font>

490
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,260
is the ultimate vote of confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

491
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,370
so the only question I would ask is are

492
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,830
we to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still getting the</font>

493
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,620
volunteers we need to even process and

494
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,389
police to develop those volunteers are

495
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,820
we getting the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> participation</font>

496
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:30,780
we need your<font color="#CCCCCC"> peopie are we putting the</font>

497
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:32,909
right cogs and the right holes you know

498
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:35,910
it's we've gone past the stage where the

499
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,410
early pioneers are you know something

500
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,820
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them were on the stage but at</font>

501
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,800
some point the early pioneers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are stuff</font>

502
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,730
wait we've other folks ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to step in</font>

503
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,730
and do

504
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:53,480
somebody want to answer I mean I i can

505
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:57,050
give you my dan you're absolutely right

506
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:01,460
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer in two ways we recognize</font>

507
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:03,590
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to behave more inner is a</font>

508
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,080
professional organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it comes</font>

509
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:08,750
to our sponsors there's processes in

510
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,210
operational activities that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

511
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,220
change so that it's it is professional

512
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,790
that it's more streamlined than what

513
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,100
it's been we acknowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

514
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,990
thank everyone who's been willing to

515
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:26,360
stay the course with us and we know it's

516
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:27,830
been bumpy as a board as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ed we</font>

517
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,320
make a commitment that it is getting

518
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">better and we spent a lot a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

519
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,700
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make that better in</font>

520
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:38,270
fact so much so that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't say</font>

521
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,640
oh here's the new model we I wished I

522
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,679
had that for you we're not quite there

523
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,080
yet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to make sure that it</font>

524
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,910
is professional that we understand it

525
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,820
and that we can honor the commitment

526
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:52,309
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make to us so we're</font>

527
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,830
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and foremost it's right in front</font>

528
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:58,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">of us the second part do we have enough</font>

529
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:01,699
volunteers and and do can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sustain the</font>

530
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,860
volunteer structure that we have we

531
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,320
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot and we talk about</font>

532
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:11,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the balance between volunteers and</font>

533
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:14,290
paid contractors ought to be how much do

534
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">we go to a model where we pay</font>

535
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:20,960
contractors to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything for us just</font>

536
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,490
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than trying to</font>

537
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the balance of some</font>

538
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,190
contractors and some sponsors or

539
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,990
volunteers doing bits and pieces of it

540
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">we had a very long day today talking</font>

541
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:36,350
about just those issues we have it lost

542
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,840
track of it and i should say we don't

543
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:41,389
have any problem finding volunteers from

544
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,610
the community to do things for us the

545
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,720
nice thing about nana is that you're all

546
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:49,428
committed and so when Betty says hey

547
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,370
something happened I need somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

548
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:54,260
help me I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a problem finding</font>

549
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,290
somebody out here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a way to get</font>

550
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,900
help for Nana

551
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:00,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the board is an excellent</font>

552
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">resource in giving me direction on who</font>

553
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,760
to call so we have never found a prop

554
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,920
you know having a problem getting

555
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,240
somebody to step up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do something for</font>

556
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:14,940
us it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more an issue of us deciding do</font>

557
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,400
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay pay for that so we have a</font>

558
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,740
paid service level agreement and it's a

559
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more ironclad than the work</font>

560
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,240
that it takes to find volunteer

561
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,669
so Dan's asking if we have enough

rest of you aren't being directed at his

564
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:45,070
very quiet voice Dave points out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

565
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:51,280
is now chairman of the mailing list

566
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:56,050
committee thanks Arkham our committees

567
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:58,360
or staff but I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll all get</font>

568
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,870
a better handle on that commitment level

569
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,850
dan when we do elections again when we

570
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:08,139
get folks who are willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to step</font>

571
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:10,719
forward and and take on the work that

572
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:14,110
your board has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking on the past</font>

573
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,390
18 months are they willing to be equally

574
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,520
committed in the same thing with program

575
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,320
committee members we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font>

576
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,870
sure until we do elections again in the

577
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:29,230
fall but but I can't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone</font>

578
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:32,709
who's there now is fully engaged<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jolie</font>

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:36,700
giggly quick comment well former and

580
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:38,320
probably future sponsor but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

581
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,570
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's too many logos out</font>

582
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,399
there I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually just fine</font>

583
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,620
as long as they stay out there when

584
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,130
they're on the podium that'll be like I

585
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:53,649
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bridge too far so you</font>

586
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:55,810
know we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to keep things in you</font>

587
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,810
know keep our roots in mind and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

588
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:02,020
that that that guidance will probably

589
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:04,320
hold us in good stead it has so far

590
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:08,020
you're absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> right part of the</font>

591
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,689
value set that we hold and share with

592
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:14,650
you is to create a vendor neutral

593
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:16,960
environment inside this room so we love

594
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:19,690
sponsors it's great to have them<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

595
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,520
it's wonderful to have socials but by

596
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,510
doing that does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you the right</font>

597
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be here at the microphone or two to</font>

598
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,890
have control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the program and so</font>

599
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:32,020
that again is part of the dialogue that

600
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,360
we have with the sponsors but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

601
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,110
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a commitment that we have</font>

602
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:42,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one of our goals and</font>

603
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:44,760
and founding elements I'm sorry I'm here

604
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:47,940
again but I like to also echo a Joel

605
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,890
said I'm definitely concerned that if we

606
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,020
were to ever see like sponsorship logos

607
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,840
as responsive by the way in the meetings

608
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,309
and such<font color="#CCCCCC"> BB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which to fall but in</font>

609
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,840
responding me a little bit to what Dan

610
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:02,670
said I want to caution one thing you

611
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,949
know certainly you know if you guys need

612
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to increase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dollar amount for</font>

613
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,870
sponsor to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so on and so forth</font>

614
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:12,689
I'll be fine but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the Prophet</font>

615
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:14,459
you know becoming more professional yes

616
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,590
for the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> year as we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

617
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,510
for the first time the things in the

618
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:21,120
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that obviously could have been</font>

619
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,940
done better but I also wouldn't go so

620
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,790
far down that process to essentially

621
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:28,380
create the processes and procedures and

622
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:31,320
so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth that takes you know</font>

623
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,690
people's times that is not necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

624
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,340
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know we need to know what</font>

625
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best solution is and what the</font>

626
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,500
easiest way to have no not be a you know

627
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,750
an organization for sponsors to deal

628
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,549
with and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stop there and no</font>

629
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">further yeah and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be very</font>

630
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:48,830
cognizant of the fact that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

631
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,200
member-driven organization like this

632
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:57,110
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no reason for us to be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

633
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,110
what we are thank you

634
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,580
anybody have a

635
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,639
mentioned a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the sponsors and</font>

636
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:13,949
obviously there's been an increase in

637
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:17,189
the number of sponsors over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last few</font>

638
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:21,029
who are easy I'm vishal sharma<font color="#E5E5E5"> met</font>

639
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:23,009
annoying and my question is what is what

640
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:25,709
is the value that<font color="#CCCCCC"> na nóg is planning to</font>

641
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:27,029
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sponsors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean you know</font>

642
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">they obviously do not influence the</font>

643
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:31,229
program that's like sacrosanct and nanog

644
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:33,178
and that should stand but in addition to

645
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:35,429
that where is the value for the sponsors

646
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,799
as the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sponsors increases and</font>

647
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:40,200
the sponsorships shifts labs increase

648
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:45,089
what is the promise<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the sponsors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

649
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:48,299
just wondering sure we make a commitment

650
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:50,759
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our sponsors that we will help</font>

651
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,369
promote their visibility through our

652
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:56,789
signage through these slides that you

653
00:31:53,369 --> 00:32:02,089
see it breaks you know recognizing their

654
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:04,709
contribution we do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of web page</font>

655
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:08,539
presentation again recognizing the

656
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:11,969
sponsorship the nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about nanos</font>

657
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:14,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we value our archive so</font>

658
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:17,129
if you respond sir that's archived and

659
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,749
it lives as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> nan organs around</font>

660
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:20,458
and there's information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your</font>

661
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:22,589
engagement and that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

662
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:26,190
valuable not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that with a</font>

663
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:28,589
lot of investments in organizations like

664
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:32,009
Nana the other thing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> promise in</font>

665
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:35,458
the value returned is that we provide a

666
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:37,079
set up inside the exhibit I don't want

667
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:40,379
to call exhibit excuse me wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> word</font>

668
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:44,158
because we don't do exhibit halls but we

669
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:46,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide and pay attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the setup</font>

670
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,869
of where the break food is the breakfast

671
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:51,928
food and we make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

672
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:55,320
traffic pattern so that if you're a

673
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:57,509
vendor at break or a vendor who is

674
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,379
participants or that's participating at

675
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:03,570
breakfast that you have an area that's

676
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:07,408
assigned to you where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

677
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:10,139
your display and you can have access and

678
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:13,589
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available to all of the attendees</font>

679
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:17,218
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are here doesn't it doesn't mean</font>

680
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:19,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that everyone has to come by you but it</font>

681
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:23,230
gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opportunity to have access</font>

682
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:25,000
to them outside of this room and we have

683
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,650
a variety of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways in which we can do</font>

684
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,720
that through<font color="#CCCCCC"> beer and gear through</font>

685
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:32,440
breaks through all sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

686
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,770
we've we've priced our sponsorship model

687
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:39,340
accordingly to deal with that return on

688
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:41,110
investment so there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know really</font>

689
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,980
large investments in their smaller ones

690
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:48,159
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the sponsor with the</font>

691
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,830
development<font color="#CCCCCC"> team to right-size which one</font>

692
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,080
works best for you ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

693
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,699
that's good the day slabs and then you

694
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,669
have opportunities for visibility and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

695
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:01,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I guess one way for nanog to also do</font>

696
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:04,600
to kind of capitalize on the base that

697
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:06,730
nanog has is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just and then require</font>

698
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,710
some thought process probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just</font>

699
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,840
being I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be so constructed</font>

700
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,510
that just being a sponsor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an event</font>

701
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,780
that is vendor-neutral is in itself

702
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,129
something of value then you know there

703
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">are sponsors that will come forward to</font>
