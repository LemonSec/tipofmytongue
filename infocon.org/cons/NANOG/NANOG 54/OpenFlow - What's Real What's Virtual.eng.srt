1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,990
for one assembles here just a reminder

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,210
tonight we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:12,300
social happening at the USS on the USS

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:14,940
mid USS Midway so just a reminder to to

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,080
come out there and see this massive ship

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,890
and all the interesting thing they have

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard there's some great</font>

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:26,698
flight simulators and whatnot so it

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:32,340
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool well</font>

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:34,079
that's a massive clock uh um so welcome

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">to now 954 it's kind of it's kind of</font>

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,870
nice to be up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be the</font>

13
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,209
program committee chair it's like nice

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,190
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have somebody else have that job but</font>

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,050
it's still nice to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the all of</font>

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,339
the folks out here so it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,610
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here so this panel is on open</font>

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,739
flow and the related technologies we got

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,210
quite a few inquiries and decided we try

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,300
to do a panel on this we had a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">talks last time and this particular</font>

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,300
panel is is supposed to kind of be

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,760
driving it you know the difference

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">between fact and fiction and what's real</font>

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,909
and what's not real so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 33 people</font>

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,880
who are active in the industry we have

27
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,170
let's see who have we have Guido so I

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get written the less they might</font>

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple App how you see how your French</font>

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,520
dressing up and so on okay so there you

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:29,039
go he's a CTL big switch which is a one

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,399
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the startups in the space at crab</font>

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,170
Google and Kirk Beckman from brocade and

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,479
all of these folks will give us a

35
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,540
different or sort of their view of what

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,979
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the state of the art is where</font>

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is going and what what the</font>

38
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,979
difference between fact and fiction is

39
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,259
so now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is figure out</font>

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,220
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess we're going to do it Guido</font>

41
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kurt and then add so how do we see the</font>

42
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,829
slide the slide decks can you do that

43
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then I guess this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the device and</font>

44
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,889
wow this is fancy so you can eat would

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,890
you like to in a parent

46
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,820
all right super can you hear me<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

47
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,350
so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my slides trying</font>

48
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,299
to answer the question what's what's

49
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,070
real what's virtual about<font color="#CCCCCC"> openflow the</font>

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,870
actual the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was go back</font>

51
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ask when did we start this whole</font>

52
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,300
thing and if you much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everybody can</font>

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,100
read this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

54
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,050
OpenFlow website the first draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">openflow spec was actually published in</font>

56
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,770
november two thousand seven and if you

57
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,300
read further it says there's a little

58
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">footnote that the final specs is</font>

59
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,330
expected for early two thousand eight

60
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:43,060
the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenFlow wondered Oh spec was</font>

61
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,550
actually published in no December 31st

62
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,959
2009 so almost / 2010 so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years</font>

63
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:51,640
late and so I ask myself well how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

64
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,980
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it took so much longer than</font>

65
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,260
we initially expected the the original

66
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,090
designers expected and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think for me</font>

67
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">personally the answer is I think</font>

68
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,420
building a centralized control plane

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,550
which is essentially what open flow is

70
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,369
about turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to be a lot harder than</font>

71
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,019
we originally thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proud</font>

72
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,060
to say that during my time at Stanford

73
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,230
we figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out ways to melt down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

74
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,549
network that at least I had not

75
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:17,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">previously thought about and but I think</font>

76
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,630
the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> news is that at the end of this</font>

77
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,459
process of figuring out how to build

78
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,620
centralized control planes is that today

79
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,720
we have a rough architecture for open

80
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,190
flow that is emerging and that seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

81
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">be working pretty well and the</font>

82
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">architecture is shown here so to build</font>

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,309
an open flow based system we basically

84
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,410
have three major pieces we have the data

85
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,850
plane so these are switches can be

86
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,440
software switches or<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware switches</font>

87
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,480
for this talk I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly talk about</font>

88
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,970
Harvard switches that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,230
enabled with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenFlow protocol we</font>

90
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,549
have a controller platform that

91
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,768
basically talks to the switches and

92
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,350
exposes an<font color="#E5E5E5"> API up on top to the</font>

93
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,640
applications running on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and</font>

94
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,200
then we have applications that actually

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,950
provide the new interesting services in

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,238
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want so for this</font>

97
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,010
targa<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it fairly simple</font>

98
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,110
I just want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

99
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,000
perspective from what we've seen for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

100
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,500
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane for the switches for the</font>

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,010
controller platforms and for the

102
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,010
applications

103
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,630
so again a little bit of history here's

104
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,790
of a rough timeline of the open floor

105
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,548
specification you know from 2007 to

106
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,839
today open floor wonder to actually has

107
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">been approved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the open networking</font>

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,739
foundation but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently an embargo</font>

109
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,539
period where it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> public yet you</font>

110
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,830
know that's but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should change in</font>

111
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,820
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> month or so you know if you in</font>

112
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,310
parallel to the standards development

113
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,400
look at how switches have been developed

114
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,200
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mid-2008 we start to do</font>

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,859
first research demos<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the first</font>

116
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,020
ones where NEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco juniper and HP you</font>

117
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,610
know in 2010 we started seeing the

118
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,830
development of these of these

119
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,210
implementations move out of research lab

120
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,310
out of universities more into the

121
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,989
development units of of the switch

122
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:57,730
vendors and then it was only in early

123
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,590
actually was mid last year you know what

124
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,260
may that NEC as the first company

125
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,049
offered<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generally available open flow</font>

126
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,300
switch followed by IBM late last year

127
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,400
and then HP orly this year so we only

128
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,680
have been building generally available

129
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,310
open flow switches for about six months

130
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,960
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the really interesting question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

131
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,700
what's going to happen next and you know

132
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the best is still to come I</font>

133
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,669
think over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of for the rest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

134
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,650
this year will see a number of

135
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,479
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors tumble their switches</font>

136
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,000
and I'm very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about what</font>

137
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,900
I've seen in the product pipelines of

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,370
some of the manufacturers there to give

139
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brief overview of what can open</font>

140
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,240
force which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is due today so the most</font>

141
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,740
common open flow switch we have is the

142
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,590
sort of pizza box top of rack type

143
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,660
design it comes in 10 gig or one gig

144
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,820
flavors so high density 10 gig 48 ports

145
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,940

implement most of open floor 10 with a

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,930
these are switching chips so they have

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,640
very small buffers so as of today

179

there's four different vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font>

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,030
in time you know my prediction is the

definitely double this year but but

188
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,120
probably grow even faster so this should

generally these controls often SDN

200
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,640
protocols to these to these switches as

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,470
well and then there's a northbound API

202
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,030
messing with the controller tonight's do

203
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,070
this to provide an interface to

so we can reason about the network as a

whole a lot of the complexity of the

214
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,050

215
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,729
figuring out how to build a distributed

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,190
system you know with eventual

217
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,890
consistency guarantees that then exposes

237

the commercial ones have another couple

of features which you'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

probably network virtualization be

267
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,740

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications so here's a little bit of</font>

292
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,069
pseudocode to show show what you can do

293
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,630
here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general programming your network</font>

294
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,950
directly with open flow tends to be hard

295
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,100
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have to talk to every</font>

296
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:07,380
every separate network device you know

297
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,970
and individually you have to physically

298
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,860
worry about what if they go down but if

299
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,470
they reset state you know it make sure

300
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know making</font>

301
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,340
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you converge in terms of the</font>

302
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,570
intermediate state that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're gathering</font>

303
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,800
with this DN<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether the control</font>

304
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,510
platform becomes a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

305
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,189
now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a centralized API which can</font>

306
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,990
query about the state of the entire of

307
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,570
the entire network so here's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

308
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,070
pseudocode for example if you want to

309
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,470
essentially set up you know take a flow

310
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,640
between two end hosts and you know map

311
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,350
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a different priority queue and</font>

312
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,510
your network to to give it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> qos</font>

313
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,710
guarantees you know in general that's a

314
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,030
hard problem because you first have to

315
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">find those holes if you have lots of</font>

316
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,030
switches you may or may not have

317
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,380
infrastructure in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find it find</font>

318
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,510
it automatically then you have to

319
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,560
determine paths and so on with open flow

320
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,060
you can potentially this much much

321
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,290
easier visibly directly acquiring the

322
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,880
controller platform saying where<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

323
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,110
these hosts and you know give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

324
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,550
shortest path between them and now i'm

325
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,590
physic just insert flow table entries

326
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,680
that will forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> this flow along this</font>

327
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,420
path and you know then you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> subscribe</font>

328
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,339
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an event physically saying you know i</font>

329
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,020
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all notifications if hosts</font>

330
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,700
move so if I see a host move on the

331
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,020
network in that case allow me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

332
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can recompute you know what's</font>

333
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening my network this is gross</font>

334
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,000
oversimplification but I think you get

335
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">the idea of what's possible with what</font>

336
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this platform so in the last but not</font>

337
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,340
least in order to get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

338
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,479
discussion going here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

339
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,700
make some predictions for what we're

340
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,880
going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year you know I think</font>

341
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">in 2012 my guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is most switch and</font>

342
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,200
router hardware vendors will announce an

343
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,810
open fall or at least sdn strategy of

344
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,160
some type you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> those vendors I</font>

345
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,589
think the majority will actually have

346
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices available as generally available</font>

347
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,420
in the market and you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

348
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,250
also see a fair number of mid to large

349
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,490
scale deployments that they become

350
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,560
public and primarily led by initially by

351
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,390
data center deployment but then going

352
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">very on time thanks</font>

353
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,559
what else<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks sorry what I what I was</font>

354
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,999
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do would kind of like</font>

355
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,740
aggregate all the questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the end</font>

356
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:05,199
so unless somebody has questions right

357
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,629
now we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go on to the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speaker</font>

358
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,628
and we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them at the end so Kurt</font>

359
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,859
thanks Dave this is my first nanog and

360
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm glad to be here and I was lucky</font>

361
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough to run into bill Norton at the</font>

362
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,959
airport and he shared<font color="#E5E5E5"> his internet</font>

363
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrying book with me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by way of</font>

364
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">welcoming me and he's got a little</font>

365
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,199
anecdote<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what happened actually at</font>

366
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,970
this end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the flight and the book so</font>

367
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:40,180
stop by and talk to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

368
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:47,310
so it's a little bit nerdy yeah we're

369
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:47,310
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the next to Eddie no yeah</font>

370
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,529
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys swap the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ducks</font>

371
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:06,090
I do i do pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much agree with guidos</font>

372
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,680
predictions not overly bold but

373
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,900
appropriate for the market but we'll see

374
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,969
maybe maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be wrong too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

375
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:16,590
so here my slides my name is Kurt

376
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:20,490
Beckman with brocade perhaps lives well

377
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:22,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">and changeless I wonder if these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

378
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:27,420
slides I thought they were but let's

379
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:30,240
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so first I want to touch on the</font>

380
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:36,209
conventional wisdom about open flow we

381
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,590
get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of contradictory statements</font>

382
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">out here so Scott</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shankar one of the</font>

383
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:44,070
fathers of open flow there are several

384
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">fathers said more than once open flow</font>

385
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,850
doesn't let you do anything new or

386
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,950
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you couldn't do before and</font>

387
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,060
you think really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well if that's true you</font>

388
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,620
know why would I care why do I care

389
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,780
about open flow of if I can't do

390
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,670
anything new but his like his next

391
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,280
sentence was to say but it does give you

392
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,290
a programmatic interface so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

393
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">independent software developer now you</font>

394
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,050
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something that you couldn't do</font>

395
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,550
before and that's kind of interesting or

396
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,109
if you're a network operator that has

397
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,640
the capability of coding you've got

398
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,430
developers now you can do some new

399
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,580
things sure if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a switch developer</font>

400
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,770
like brocade<font color="#E5E5E5"> open flow it doesn't let</font>

401
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,920
you do much new but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting bits</font>

402
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,810
in that programmatic interface it

403
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,360
enables all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possibilities and</font>

404
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,650
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these other meetings</font>

405
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,970
you'll see people talk more about the

406
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,829
possibilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> Guido mentioned the</font>

407
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,690
virtualized networking inside the data

408
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,340
center you can virtualize networks

409
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,280
outside the data center as well there's

410
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,870
there's a number of applications traffic

411
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,459
engineering and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> edel</font>

412
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,890
talk more about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going into</font>

413
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of the applications so that's what</font>

414
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:47,760
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do sort of as we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font>

415
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,410
most people are adopting one adopted 101

416
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,720
that one's not getting a lot of adoption

417
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">one dot to that will come out and a few</font>

418
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">days really come out of embargo there's</font>

419
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,099
not been a lot of commitments about it

420
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,660
people talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but will it be</font>

421
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,280
adopted it's hard to say and there's

422
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,850
reasons for that that I might talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

423
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,500
in a little bit so open flow today the

424
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,620
standard does it exists there's lots of

425
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,090
gaps it's really early days and so it's

426
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,470
not today's versions of the standard

427
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that enable this but it's the</font>

428
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,200
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> open flow that enables these</font>

429
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,150
things so historically is we we hardware

430
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,910
vendors have controlled the software and

431
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've paid for the software development</font>

432
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:29,540
through selling<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware and that has</font>

433
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,750
constrained the the pace of innovation

434
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:36,120
so when soft switches became part of the

435
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,590
game a few years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> with hypervisors</font>

436
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,070
and so on that altered the game a little

437
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:45,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit and now open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flow alters it in a</font>

438
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:47,370
bigger way as as vendors adopted so we

439
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,910
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much more rapid</font>

440
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,830
innovation going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward because will</font>

441
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:56,550
now be iterating at a software kind of a

442
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,260
pace instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware you know</font>

443
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,680
every six to nine months you get a new

444
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,730
release so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> news bad news</font>

445
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,119
software-defined networking of which

446
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,290
open flow is a prominent part that gives

447
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,929
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power to do whatever you want</font>

448
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,639
you know and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that naturally</font>

449
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:15,180
means that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough rope to hang</font>

450
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,120
yourself if if you're not careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> so be</font>

451
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,520
careful and the number of interesting

452
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,139
applications is huge well that's good

453
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,790
news<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a big market but on the</font>

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,890
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand in the standards body it</font>

455
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,649
means there's a million voices and it's

456
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,240
hard for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to prioritize and figure out</font>

457
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,200
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement because the right thing</font>

458
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,210
for somebody's the wrong thing for

459
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,570
somebody else and so things go a little

460
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,920
bit slow people like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the compute</font>

461
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,810
stack oh we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really sweet</font>

462
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,420
compute stack<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nicely layered we got</font>

463
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,340
vendors competing in every aspect of

464
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,320
that compute stack wouldn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice</font>

465
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,320
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that networking it's a familiar</font>

466
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,300
framework and helpful but we're not in

467
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,120
the same position we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

468
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:58,080
equivalent of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel yet and actually</font>

469
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,090
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other differences you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

470
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,639
much more widely deployed than computing

471
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,939
was when the compute stack was

472
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,110
developing so we have this legacy of

473
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,090
existing hardware that open flow wants

474
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:13,879
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and that that kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

475
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:15,810
complicates life a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot so we need to</font>

476
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,460
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how we're going to move to</font>

477
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:23,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that networking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stack given where we are</font>

478
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,300
in the life cycle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of network</font>

479
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:29,540
so one thing I like to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

480
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,490
expectations it really bugs me when when

481
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,080
we can't deliver on expectations because

482
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,970
the expectations are just so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

483
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead of reality so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a couple</font>

484
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,690
slides on that here so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

485
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,420
contradictions that you often see in

486
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,400
here because people are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

487
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,830
different time scales there's the time

488
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,120
scale of can i buy something and I need

489
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">to plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's the</font>

490
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,209
time scale about oh there's the future

491
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I want you to be excited about this</font>

492
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,740
open flow thing and supported and an

493
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:58,730
express interest so that vendors pursue

494
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,429
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenFlow 1 dot 0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and 1 dot 1 are</font>

495
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,550
pretty limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 dot 2 is added some</font>

496
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:06,140
stuff but it also has gaps ipv6 was

497
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,919
missing from those first two versions

498
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,660
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more Envy in 12</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pi</font>

499
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,040
availabilities not part of the spec

500
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,670
people have implemented it but it's

501
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,750
outside the spec or beyond the spec

502
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,220
configuration is now coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed</font>

503
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,900
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't in those early ones and</font>

504
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">topology discover and you can go on</font>

505
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,590
there's just lots of stuff missing

506
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,830
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cool demos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show a</font>

507
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:29,899
link later on people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are demonstrating</font>

508
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,399
this but there is really either a

509
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,870
constrained environment or maybe they

510
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,380
did some extensions or they're operating

511
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,120
a little bit beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec etc so a</font>

512
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,320
lot of this cool stuff is it's

513
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,399
definitely going to come I mean I'm a

514
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,080
believer<font color="#CCCCCC"> in open flow and is it within</font>

515
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,700
your planning horizon well it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

516
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,139
your planning horizon and sort of what

517
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,140
problem you're looking to solve and when

518
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,660
oh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> F is you know 1.2 as we said is</font>

519
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,550
coming right<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and 13 and 14 will be</font>

520
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,720
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> later this year so they're they're</font>

521
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,909
taking a little bit different approach

522
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,860
to standards development it doesn't come

523
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,950
out when it's ready necessarily we're

524
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,770
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to deadlines and that's</font>

525
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,110
getting us to be more productive but

526
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:14,300
some things often miss the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deadlines</font>

527
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:16,699
so it's coming out kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of chunky so</font>

528
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,340
we've had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 but miss another v6</font>

529
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,740
for example and there's going to

530
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,260
continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more useful stuff added</font>

531
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">we know sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of mentioned but well both</font>

532
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">of us the hardware developers are mostly</font>

533
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,879
running on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot o version of the spec</font>

534
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,980
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some aspects of one dot one</font>

535
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,780
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it says that I'll talk</font>

536
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,330
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

537
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:42,310
sorry 10,000 foot view let's step back

538
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:44,800
from the ones and<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeroes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we</font>

539
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:47,590
don't have certification there is a

540
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,830
testing working group we're gonna have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

541
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,020
plug fest in a few weeks and and that'll

542
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,340
get somewhere get us somewhere but it's

543
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,650
still not the same as conformance

544
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,720
testing that's also being worked but

545
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,580
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways off so prior to that</font>

546
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,300
stage interoperability isn't guaranteed

547
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,760
at all so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you provide a solution</font>

548
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,370
is you partner with folks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as</font>

549
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,270
customers either prepare to if you're

550
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write your own controller</font>

551
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,650
prepare to partner with a switch vendor

552
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,540
if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy a controller you</font>

553
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,130
didn't have to sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with two</font>

554
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,490
companies to do that you don't just go

555
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,510
get a you know mix<font color="#E5E5E5"> and match I'll get</font>

556
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,970
one of these and I'll hook it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

557
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever I feel like it so and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you also</font>

558
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,280
may not find the app<font color="#CCCCCC"> date that you're</font>

559
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,050
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for because you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

560
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,240
write your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

561
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,220
care but then you still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

562
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well which the switches that can do</font>

563
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,650
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need it to do and also there's</font>

564
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,330
been a lot of talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how open flow</font>

565
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,190
is just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to commoditize a switch</font>

566
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,340
and really drive down pricing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

567
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,830
near term switch vendors are taking

568
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,470
existing switches and adding some open

569
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,629

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,250
incremental incrementing more work not

571
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,380
less work it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to drive down</font>

572
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,260
the cost in the air term especially when

573
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:03,250
you don't have strong interoperability

574
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,330
and competitiveness in that way medium

575
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,640
term will get a lot more

576
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,159
interoperability basic applications

577
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,550
whatever those are should be able to

578
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,080
work on more than one box but the more

579
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,639
interesting applications will probably

580
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,889
require additional extensions or

581
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,150
answering questions that kind of go

582
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:24,070
beyond what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec can answer and and</font>

583
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">so even with certifications they'll</font>

584
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,919
still be partnering in order to

585
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,889
delivering deliver really interesting

586
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,770
applications and also you will see

587
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,380
vendors focusing on specific

588
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">applications basis they can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take on</font>

589
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,700
the whole market<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a whole potential</font>

590
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,970
market it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too big and there's too</font>

591
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,120
much

592
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,860
going on and then in the longer term the

593
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,659
interoperability will be much less of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

594
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,260
problem I expect you'll see some

595
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,940
consolidations and they'll be you know

596
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:55,540
big and trusted vendors in the space and

597
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you probably you know if you're not in a</font>

598
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,389
real tiny niche you'll probably be able

599
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:05,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find the applications that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

600
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:07,630
and and get some interoperability so a

601
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:12,310
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask how come how can you</font>

602
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,150
engage an open flow I mean what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

603
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,060
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in ways you can</font>

604
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,560
participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of depends who</font>

605
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,679
you are of course and I decided I'd

606
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">slice that space in terms of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

607
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,180
resources you have and what kind of

608
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:31,480
challenges you face and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

609
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:33,160
very not this whole space is interesting

610
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,050
there's there's only some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

611
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,640
spaces that really make sense if you if

612
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,110
you're underwater in terms of resources

613
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,300
and at the cutting edge you should just

614
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">bail you're not going to be able to</font>

615
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,220
accomplish much<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's not a</font>

616
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,470
realistic space and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other corner</font>

617
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,480
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons of time and and you're not</font>

618
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,860
not very much demanding environment I

619
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,210
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think very many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

620

room are in either of those corners it's

621
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,720
going to be more along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the diagonal if</font>

622
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:59,950
you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> got any resources in your</font>

623
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you basically overloaded you got</font>

624
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,870
some challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you're overloaded</font>

625
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,090
then skim the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blog's during your minimal</font>

626
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:09,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">lunch time otherwise watch the demos and</font>

627
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,500
this is the URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to open flow</font>

628
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:16,690
org they're good demos there give you a

629
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,130
sense about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the applications are</font>

630
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,540
potential applications that people have

631
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,850
been thinking about and they're they're

632
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:24,580
quite interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and diverse and you</font>

633
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,500
can read the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> specs that are posted</font>

been talking about fires burning with

639
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,899
issues during the embargo so that should

640
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,760
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up shortly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

641
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open flow tutorial it's online</font>

642
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,020
there's a link there and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

643
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,240
materials there and it runs in a

644
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,760
hypervisor on your laptop if you want so

645
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,250
in terms of resources it's pretty

646
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,930
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through that I've done it and it's</font>

647
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,460
nice to do it at one of the meetings

648
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,080
where there's a bunch experts wandering

649
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,880
around but you can do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your own and</font>

650
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,879
pretty well<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense of it and get a</font>

651
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,820
feel for what this open flow is is

652
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,930
currently able to do today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

653
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,280
necessarily where it's going and then

654
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,650
you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> and expand that if you've</font>

655
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,360
got more resources and and it's more

656
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,800
interesting to you because if you're out

657
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,030
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bleeding edge is where open flow</font>

658
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,669
gets interesting because that's where

659
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:24,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problems are not solved as well as</font>

660
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:27,120
you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be then if you're</font>

661
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,560
more time and more more challenges in

662
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,219
your environment you should get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

663
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,810
stuff in your lab get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> units and and</font>

664
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,720
put it through<font color="#CCCCCC"> its paces and as Guido</font>

665
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:38,490
said there's customer or sorry vendors

666
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,620
that several vendors that offers stuff

667
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,470
for sale today and I think some other

668
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,600
vendors one I know of in particular that

669
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,060
you can get stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your lab even</font>

670
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,280
though it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not technically for sale yet</font>

671
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:52,139
and then you can become active in oh and

672
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of course that I've got you over on the</font>

673
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,850
right side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resources there that</font>

674
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:59,400
means you can write<font color="#E5E5E5"> the check and it's</font>

675
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:02,790
not a huge check some some customers are

676
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,500
able to write that check beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

677
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:07,050
then deploy it in a you know

678
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,030
pre-production or a pre standard thing

679
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,040
in production and then if you're really

680
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,800
bold you can write your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font>

681
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,230
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that was the lat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

682
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,030
okay good i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> add side so these were</font>

683
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,240
the draft slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> i submitted more slides</font>

684
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:24,480
last night but we ended up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones</font>

685
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i submitted three weeks ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

686
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,600
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple things about one</font>

687
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,900
dot 1 and 12 so they added<font color="#E5E5E5"> one dot 1 and</font>

688
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,459
1 dot to<font color="#CCCCCC"> niles take another step back to</font>

689
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,220
wonder wand otto was a very simplistic

690
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">model a single sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tea cam like</font>

691
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,260
table was the assumption that of what

692
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,490
existed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the switch and people could</font>

693
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">get clever about how they programmed</font>

694
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and maybe loop back around</font>

695
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,740
that table which is slightly out of the

696
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,139
standard but you could do clever

697
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,680
searching and

698
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:57,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">are matching and actions based on that</font>

699
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,930
and most switches were able to support

700
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,729
that but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was complicated to achieve</font>

701
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,430
things because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that limited</font>

702
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,750
architecture so one dot one it added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

703
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,390
couple of key things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> added support</font>

704
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,610
for groups and it also allowed for

705
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,630
multiple tables with a mechanism to do

706
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,679
to have a go to action from one table to

707
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,960
get to another<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and do further</font>

708
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,480
matching and further actions and further

709
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,890
go tues and and so on well<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was very</font>

710
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,560
powerful you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do all kinds of things</font>

711
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,360
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> model unfortunately it's much</font>

723
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,280
exist for 13 so software implementations

724
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,670
or NP you I network across their unit

725
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,410
implementations are able to essentially

726
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,080
emulate that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very flexible it's</font>

727
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:06,110
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so you see it 11 part of</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenFlow world is comfortable with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these one dot 10 12 implementations and</font>

730
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,580
then hardware vendors like like brocade

731
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,220
look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of struggle and so</font>

732
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,110
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use 10 and add an</font>

733
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,510
extension here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition there</font>

734
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:25,040
meanwhile in in onf there's a

735
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:27,020
recognition that that not not both sides

736
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,170
not both kinds of switches software and

737
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,240
hardware soft and hard are sort of

738
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,750
equally supported and so there's a lot

739
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">of flurry of activity with bursts of</font>

740
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,940
progress toward addressing that issue

741
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy that we're making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

742
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,900
progress I wish we were making it faster

743
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,300
but there will be some changes probably

744
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:51,380
later this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year that will really allow</font>

745
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:53,780
the hardware based switches to join the

746
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">party in a better way with with full</font>

747
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,889
standards compliance versus the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

749
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:08,659
so thank you I know

750
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:10,309
the baton back today so again I think

751
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">will unless anybody has any questions</font>

752
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:22,250
right now we'll go to Eddie and then

753
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:25,730
we'll do questions all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right morning all</font>

754
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,850
or not morning anymore so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying</font>

755
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:31,100
to sell you anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work at Google I</font>

756
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:33,408
operate a fairly large network which

757
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,779
includes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large backbone and a</font>

758
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:39,889
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very large data centers I</font>

759
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:41,929
actually don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that open flow</font>

760
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:45,620
itself is is particularly interesting as

761
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:48,740
protocol I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is the leading</font>

762
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:52,758
instantiation of software-defined

763
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,049
networking today and I'm certainly a big

764
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,850
booster of it we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in it</font>

765
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:57,559
for a number of years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do a</font>

766
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:59,509
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of very useful things with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

767
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,820
I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some of those in the</font>

768
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:04,940
abstract in a little bit but

769
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,889
fundamentally I actually think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

770
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:12,110
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> over focusing on open flow</font>

771
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:14,090
honestly and what we end up hearing from

772
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,500
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors is that we're going</font>

773
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this all-seeing</font>

774
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,830
all-knowing set of applications with

775
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:23,509
total global visibility of state etc etc

776
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,759
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not against that</font>

777
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:26,990
some people are against making

778
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,940
forwarding decisions that are not

779
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,679
concurrent with the actual forwarding

780
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,389
paths I'm not one of those people and we

781
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:36,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that later if you're</font>

782
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:37,908
interested but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we end up today what</font>

783
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,350
we end up with today for open flow is

784
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:46,850
really something more like this which is

785
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:50,439
you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good costume but it's</font>

786
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:56,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what you're being told necessarily</font>

787
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:59,230
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sdn in general is very interesting to</font>

788
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:04,269
us at Google and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily</font>

789
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:06,740
because we run in environments that are

790
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:10,159
sufficiently scaled out that cost

791
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,240
savings of between five and twenty

792
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,210
percent

793
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,620
from a provisioning perspective are

794
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:19,010
quite large in terms of total monetary

795
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,840
return basically and so we have to we

796
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,520
have to be very careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we</font>

797
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,649
provision state what state goes in the

798
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,170
network how we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding state in</font>

799
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,670
the network and we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

800
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,640
careful about how we use network

801
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,200
resources in general you know not not to

802
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,600
diss<font color="#E5E5E5"> on any of our of our wonderful</font>

803
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,210
vendors here today but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general you're</font>

804
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,290
being overcharged for what's on your re

805
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:44,240
or etc etc right you just are the

806
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,510
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is five years old the CPUs</font>

807
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,220
are kind of underpowered the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

808
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,980
memory you're getting it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right i</font>

809
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess for your desktop five years ago</font>

810
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,760
but by and large you know you're being

811
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,550
overcharged for this stuff so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

812
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,260
their kind of why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sdn in general is is</font>

813
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,669
interesting so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to focus on</font>

814
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,379
open flow for my actual presentation

815
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,610
there's plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of material in the backup</font>

816
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,690
slides and I think these are going to be

817
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,580
published<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the website if you're</font>

818
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,050
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion of how we</font>

819
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,639
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take multi dimensional</font>

820
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,070
flows and map them to hardware etc etc

821
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,179
and Kurt talked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the abstract a little</font>

822
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,770
bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that with regard to</font>

823
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:23,900
the 2 point 0 work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to focus on</font>

824
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:25,010
SDA so basically sdn and I don't know

825
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,540
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many people are familiar</font>

826
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,070
with it because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been living</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

827
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,240
very rarefied environment for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

828
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,750
two years where it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font>

829
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,820
working on very closely the main thing

830
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:38,990
with all of the protocols that implement

831
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:45,080
sdn is that you're removing distributed

832
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:47,000
decision logic and database distribution

833
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,300
mechanisms from the network elements

834
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,750
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it all the slides that</font>

835
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,730
Kurt presented and that Guido presented

836
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,960
are basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> two that you're moving</font>

837
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,460
state into the controllers and the

838
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,570
applications and you're pushing state

839
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">down to the network and you're only</font>

840
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,110
pushing the state down that you need

841
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:06,590
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically it and all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them have</font>

842
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,969
the same thing now a lot of the time

843
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,260
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make the argument that sdn</font>

844
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,760
is actually going to minimize the

845
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,760
complexity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's true but that's</font>

846
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">only true on this switches so when we</font>

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,070
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very</font>

848
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:21,590
careful there's certainly a lot to be

849
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,149
said for moving complexity off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

850
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,470
devices that are difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage and</font>

851
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,480
involve a significant

852
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:29,240
of a regular policy decomposition in

853
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,190
order to do so and so moving that

854
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,990
complexity elsewhere can have benefits

855
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:36,380
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be careful when you're</font>

856
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:38,210
when you're doing it so the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

857
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:44,870
SDN has been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long time</font>

858
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:47,770
actually so Guido pointed out that the

859
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:49,908
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of open flow was around in</font>

860
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:54,918
2007 basically inside of their group

861
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:56,900
published in 2008 but well before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

862
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:57,950
there have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of protocols that</font>

863
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,240
have attempted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and they</font>

864
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,710
certainly make for interesting reading

865
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,570
if you're actually following the space

866
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:06,440
I've included a bunch of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">openflow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one dot it looks a lot like</font>

868
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,409
flow spec quite frankly flus<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beck was</font>

869
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:14,300
never widely implemented or used but

<font color="#E5E5E5">pedra did a good job and it's kind of</font>

871
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:20,450
appreciate in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways it also</font>

872
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks a lot like GSM pee again not some</font>

873
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:23,779
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people here are</font>

874
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:27,348
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with but certainly an</font>

875
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:30,349
interesting protocol these days Sdn is

876
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:35,659
instantiated really in three places

877
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:39,139
arguably but really to<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCE and open flow</font>

878
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:41,740
itself the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that open</font>

879
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:44,349
flow is pushing forwarding state

880
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:47,299
directly to a hardware abstraction layer

881
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:48,950
and is basically eliminating all

882
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,359
portions of decision process and all

883
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:55,219
bare protocols in terms of routing

884
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:59,150
protocols pce obviously is based on you

885
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:02,390
having rsvp-te deployed is is etc etc

886
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so from says the network element</font>

887
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,660
software complexity side<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

888
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,279
that's a bit higher but it is readily

889
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,009
implementable today because only your le

890
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,210
ours are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running it etc etc</font>

891
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:17,000
um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a timeline which it turns</font>

892
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,520
out is redundant because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Guido had more</font>

893
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,830
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less the same thing I want to point</font>

894
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,970
out that that dumpy engineer is one dot

895
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:27,529
one for me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote part of the spec</font>

896
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:32,000
so i have to take full<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility</font>

897
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:33,560
for that costume there are a lot of very

898
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,360
useful features in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one dot one such as</font>

899
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,720
MPLS

tags in position push pop yada yada yada

901
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,689
pretty basic stuff but honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

902
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,759
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still in its infancy and</font>

903
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:45,530
even in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 dot 2 for anyone who's</font>

904
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,790
familiar with a well-designed routing

905
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:48,680
protocol you're going to notice a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

906
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,120
inefficiencies and issues so it's

907
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,980
definitely a work in progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

908
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,990
interested in promoting it and we're

909
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,580
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in getting it to a point</font>

910
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,839
where we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the things we</font>

911
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,819
want with it because we can't do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

912
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,040
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just yet if you want to talk about</font>

913
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,080
specific applications come see me later

914
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,610
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is based around the to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

915
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,319
stuff which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite complicated and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

916
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:08,090
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put everyone to sleep with</font>

917
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm sure that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

918
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,890
tired as it is so why do we actually

919
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,160
care about sdn well I covered some of

920
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:20,049
this in the introduction but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

921
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost because most of what i do is</font>

922
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:28,840
cost optimization with bounds for

923
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:32,959
performance so from a cost perspective

924
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:36,230
there's capex obviously and I cover a

925
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,790
little bit about why I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

926
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,060
paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much for compute resources on</font>

927
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:43,250
routers ultimately but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not going</font>

928
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,500
to go for a way for a while as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kurt</font>

929
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,490
pointed out it's not like all of your

930
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,690
distributed protocols are going to

931
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,819
disappear<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your vendors are going to</font>

932
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,530
sell you these awesome blades that run

933
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,590
nothing but open flow it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

934
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,240
going to happen for a little while so

935
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,950
what we do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is move the</font>

936
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,990
heaviest workloads off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these devices</font>

937
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:06,319
and make use of total network state as

938
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:09,830
best we can so a lot of the times it's

939
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not efficient to carry really</font>

940
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,940
granular information about network state

941
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,640
to all the devices for obvious reasons

942
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,840
centralization allows us to do some

943
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,310
interesting things with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that state and</font>

944
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,010
apply some pretty well-known

945
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,630
optimization techniques to do things

946
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:27,170
like crawl stratum optimization or

947
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,910
better traffic engineering from a capex

948
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:33,500
perspective this means that I'm buying

949
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:35,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">less physical plant basically so unlike</font>

a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here I'm actually very</font>

951
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:42,560
into open flow in the win because I run

952
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">a very large backbone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network and there</font>

953
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,890
are a lot of inefficiencies with regard

00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,990
to the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic engineering</font>

00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,060
provision their networks to

957
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,649
the complexity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's a whole</font>

958
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:55,279
argument there obviously about whether

959
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:58,099
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even need mpls etc etc but ultimately</font>

960
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,810
I'm trying to run my network relatively

961
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:01,400
hot to within my performance bounds and

962
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,009
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend as little as possible a</font>

lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just not possible</font>

964
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:09,020
with today's northbound API is an SDN

965
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,279

<font color="#E5E5E5">allows us to reduce interdependencies</font>

971
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,630
between protocols a lot of the time

972
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,430
you'll find yourself bending over

973
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,900
backward to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid with a</font>

974
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,250
router protocol just because you need

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,359
the statement there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously you</font>

976
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,530
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimize that but it'll be</font>

977
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:29,390
better if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bend over</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">backwards at all and so being able to do</font>

979
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,328
direct state in position based on a

980
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,310
regular rule set from some centralized

981
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:37,670
location is obviously pretty helpful

982
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:39,890
there the reduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the complexity of</font>

distributed control systems on network

984
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:44,629
elements is obviously a good thing too<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

985
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,470
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how long everyone else takes</font>

986
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:50,180
to test their code and get it approved

987
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,669
for production deployment at this point

988
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,750
but for me it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> while and so</font>

989
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,040
the list features I have to deal with

990
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,339
there and the less complexity there is

991
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:02,150
the faster I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll new code and the</font>

can implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovative new</font>

basically the optimization techniques

that I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about you're able to</font>

design your own protocols if you're into

998
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:14,810
such things obviously there's a world of

999
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">pain there for you to explore from an</font>

1000
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,700
innovation velocity perspective which is

1001
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:22,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">primarily to speaking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the last point</font>

1002
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:24,730
being able to partition resources means

1003
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,530
that i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use pretty well-known</font>

1004
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:31,150
development techniques in order to start

1005
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:34,069
to do basic software engineering for new

1006
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,480
protocols very quickly right now it

1007
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:38,810
takes me a long time to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

1008
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:45,380
protocol into a device I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

1009
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:47,500
faster and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my presentation thank</font>

1010
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,500
you

1011
00:39:52,270 --> 00:40:02,240
well that was like drinking from a fire

1012
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:04,340
hose anybody have any questions Jake hi

1013
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,500
Jake une<font color="#CCCCCC"> idée infusion so this is</font>

1014
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor to add and I was</font>

1015
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:12,109
wondering what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into ER in terms</font>

1016
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:13,880

banana<font color="#CCCCCC"> scism the ability to recover from</font>

1022
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,790
a potential obstacle that needs to be

1023
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,869
overcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking if they can</font>

1024
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:36,140
introduce problems and also how will

1025
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:37,340
this change in terms of pushing the

1026
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,040
hardware manufacturers silicon

1027
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:44,290

any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of buffering of state tables or</font>

things to to take into<font color="#E5E5E5"> account the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

1030
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:52,250
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> now transferring state</font>

1031
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:54,529
across a network from a control

<font color="#E5E5E5">management just really or was it for the</font>

1033
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:58,550
group and shows a<font color="#E5E5E5"> generic for everyone</font>

1034
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:01,270
or well more towards bad but I guess

1035
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:04,130
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> can answer okay so I guess</font>

1036
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:05,570
obviously if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font>

1037
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of fast local repair should be</font>

1038
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:11,510
local and you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to push to</font>

1039
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:14,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">state for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the local repair I offline</font>

1040
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,530
decisions that get made for what happens

1041
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,119
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of a failure down to the</font>

1042
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,619
devices but you still have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1043
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,760
fast local control loop in order to

1044
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:21,080
effect this sort of thing so honestly

1045
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,089
it's a pretty trivial problem as far as

1046
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,940
I'm concerned it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not a</font>

1047
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly big deal as far as the</font>

1048
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,690
hardware vendors I actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1049
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:31,879
too early to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen</font>

1050
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:35,020
there i mean it's not clear how<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1051
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:38,630
developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> openflow ecology such as it is</font>

1052
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,920
is at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it's definitely an</font>

1053
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,960
emerging market<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people are</font>

1054
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,280
interested but i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold back</font>

1055
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,210
and wait to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adoption rates are</font>

1056
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:51,730
like anybody else want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1057
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:54,940
let's go here and then my name<font color="#E5E5E5"> is LJ</font>

1058
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:57,520
Walker I work Francisco I do hardware

1059
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,100
and got a plane design for one of the

1060
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,600
ninth for the 9 kb you one question

1061
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,480
primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> for head and one sort of for</font>

1062
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,670
the panel for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ed what I think I caught</font>

1063
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,490
from the presentation was if you're too

1064
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,960
big pain points our capex and the

1065
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,479
ability to do more granular traffic

1066
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,010
engineering within the data plane and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1067
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,840
traffic engineering I don't mean mpls I

1068
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,690
mean picking and choosing traffic and

1069
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:22,420
getting it somewhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardware</font>

1070
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:25,360
world those things are borderline

1071
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,760
mutually exclusive so if you have to

1072
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:33,010
wait them against each other where does

1073
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,540
that waiting come down let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me let me</font>

1074
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,350
reiterate your question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure I</font>

1075
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,380
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1076
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:40,089
carrying additional state is costly yeah

1077
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,890
the functionality to do more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1078
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:45,610
granular traffic engineering in the data

1079
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:47,859
point is expected I disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um the</font>

1080
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,840
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I disagree is because it's</font>

1081
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,900
based more on the network architectures

1082
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,000
and on the hardware if you can impose

1083
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,260
additional encapsulation types that

1084
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,790
aren't necessarily even<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known</font>

1085
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,960
protocols in order to effect a sort of

1086
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,610
traffic engineering then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can reduce</font>

1087
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the total amount of state by doing</font>

1088
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:04,510
effective aggregation things like this

1089
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:07,360
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's a</font>

1090
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,950
significant component of discipline in

1091
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,110
the network architecture yes but your

1092
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,399
pastor assuming of course you know I'm

1093
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,990
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect my hardware as much as</font>

1094
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,540
possible no not<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone makes that</font>

1095
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,919
assumption yeah also if you're not

1096
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,840
involved in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open flow to die though</font>

1097
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,780
efforts you should be just saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1098
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:28,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then for the panel and that maybe 20</font>

1099
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,370
to what extent is the spec planning on

1100
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:33,130
discussing how to make those trade-offs

1101
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:34,930
or at the very least how to get those

1102
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:36,760
trade-offs visible in the community

1103
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they do exist in at some point</font>

1104
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,850
we have to choose a over B and we're

1105
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:44,290
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need help from the industry to</font>

1106
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:45,730
figure out which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more important Kurt</font>

1107
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:48,779
is in charge of the two data working

1108
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,780
group and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defer to them</font>

1109
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:56,859
I mean I asked you<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1110
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">again it didn't I was mapping it to a</font>

1111
00:43:56,859 --> 00:44:05,020
different thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so the tudo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sport</font>

1112
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:08,849
yet say to him but<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what extent does</font>

1113
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:10,450
this will does or will the spec

1114
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,240
illustrate the fact that these

1115
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:15,009
trade-offs<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist and that as vendors we</font>

1116
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,009
have to decide what things we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1117
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,839
build and as consumers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other folks</font>

1118
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,980
have to decide which things they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1119
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,250
optimize around because at some point

1120
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,950
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be able to but yeah so then</font>

1121
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,839
obviously a very complex question here

1122
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,790
and I mean it's kind of beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spec</font>

1123
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:35,950
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those trade-offs exactly</font>

1124
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:38,050
so much as to provide enough structure

1125
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,250
for people to move forward and enough

1126
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,500
freedom for people to do a lot of

1127
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,760
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1128
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,220
moving in the right directions on that

1129
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,750
for a man to die no perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font>

1130
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:51,220
was hearing some discussion about the

1131
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,750
you were saying about the contradictions

1132
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,040
and I have a hardware background and I

1133
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,530
understand that's true but if you look

1134
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,270
at at I mean maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that affects gross</font>

1135
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,670
margins but if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

1136
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:02,800
structures for say you know network

1137
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:05,200
hardware vendors there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

1138
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,240
that go in besides just the raw product

1139
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's not just the cogs that</font>

1140
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,779
determine what you sell something for

1141
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:14,530
and conceptually if you play that

1142
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,270
forward if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to reduce the</font>

1143
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,190
number software injury engineers we need

1144
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:20,380
and reduce the amount of QA that we have

1145
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,180
to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yadda yadda yadda now you can</font>

1146
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,650
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and it's not necessarily us</font>

1147
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,328
right there can be some upstart that

1148
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,859
comes along and produces something using

1149
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:28,990
a different business model and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1150
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:31,150
it it it doesn't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

1151
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:33,399
change the the raw you know chip size

1152
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:34,750
etc in order to lower the cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1153
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,069
overall product because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1154
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,599
somebody's while operating in a much

00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:41,529
different business model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and has</font>

1156
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,060

1159
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,470
section 4.6 trade-offs no I don't think

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

1161
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:57,330
yeah just quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to that I mean</font>

1162
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think the open for specification if</font>

1163
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,569
you look at it it's philosophy has

1164
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,820
always been just to define an API you

1165
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,020
know for the switch it makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

1166
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,060
recommendations on how to build the

1167
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,440
switch and in fact it doesn't even sort

1168
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,790
of contain a functional model of how a

1169
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,200
switch to behave at all you know which

1170
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:11,460
to a certain extent as a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

1171
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,540
think we're light years away from from

1172
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,320
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> you good guidance and what to do</font>

1173
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:18,390
there yeah I guess the message there is

1174
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,480
that you can totally blow up your

pointed in your face obviously you

1178
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:30,060
should be careful and you should you

1179
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,620
know talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to good vendors like Guido</font>

1180
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,630
that are writing applications for you

1181
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:37,200
hopefully or at least informing your

1182
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:39,570
choices there go ahead Jay Hanigan with

1183
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,560
the impulse advanced communications I

1184
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:45,510
certainly see some powerful benefits to

1185
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,240
open flow as opposed to the conventional

1186
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">way of configuring individual devices on</font>

1187
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,129
a network what I'm concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with is how</font>

1188
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:56,580
gracefully does it break if I have a

1189
00:46:53,130 --> 00:47:00,120
switch that fails now I have you know

1190
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,740
traditional things such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> hsrp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VRP</font>

1191
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,980
spanning tree that will route around it

1192
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,450
if my network can't get back to the

1193
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,510
mothership because the mothership is

1194
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,950
broken and the only way it need it knows

1195
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:14,870
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get back to the mothership is</font>

1196
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:18,750
from the mothership<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suddenly have a</font>

1197
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:23,299
complete meltdown<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems like it's</font>

1198
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:26,670
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very difficult to get out of</font>

1199
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:28,140
I'm having to take this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I think we</font>

1200
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">confirmed that experimentally you can</font>

1201
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:32,879
have very effective meltdowns that way

1202
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,980
so the general question you can smoke

1203
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,240
yourself of questions that that that you

1204
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,980
need to solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one is the question of</font>

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,080
in band control visit with you forward

1206
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,640
your control traffic over your data

1207
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,529
plane you know and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you get</font>

1208
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">know since you have a number of issues</font>

1209
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:47,430
some some our latest abilities not

1210
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,850
really to feedback loops you know

1211
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:53,399
there's there's a later some some people

1212
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:54,600
that run<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdn actually using dedicated</font>

control<font color="#E5E5E5"> net was a physically separate</font>

1214
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,049
control networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think at this point</font>

1215
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,520
we understand the problem space we

1216
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,690
understand the trade-off for solving it

1217
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,030
but you know it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> real set of</font>

1218
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,640
issues yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you really have a</font>

1219
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,019
boot traffic problem right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1220
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,730
you have to bootstrap some level

1221
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:09,379
topological awareness and awareness of

1222
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,299
controllers etc etc whether it's by

1223
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,769
static configuration for whatever the

1224
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:14,240
topology is because theoretically you

1225
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:15,589
have access to what that graph is and

1226
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,879
what the attribute's are or whether

1227
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:19,460
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to design your own protocol</font>

1228
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,980
for discovery at this point oh I'll all

1229
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,690
that open<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow does show reiterate is</font>

1230
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:28,220
allow you to put state in the network

1231
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:29,869
that's it we also touched before about

1232
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,779
how we may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have more</font>

1233
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:33,950
intelligence in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch then then it</font>

1234
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:35,359
it seems at first when we talk about

1235
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:38,299
well we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to abstract us all</font>

1236
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,529
out to some external controller and I

1237
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:41,119
think what happens under failure

1238
00:48:39,529 --> 00:48:42,410
conditions is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that you</font>

1239
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,140
well we probably want to sort some of

1240
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:47,660
that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the switch and that none of</font>

1241
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,339
that's in the standard yet right and how

1242
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">much of it will go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the standard I</font>

1243
00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:54,160
don't know so we're going to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1244
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:57,470
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this place where I think you know</font>

find ways to solve these problems I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

1248
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,779
we're not unaware that these problems

exist but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be standardized so</font>

1250

you'll be in that partner kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:17,440
get to it where do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you draw</font>

1281
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,419
the line for

1282
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,369
number of faults that you pre-program

1283
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,470
local repair<font color="#E5E5E5"> verses which you program</font>

1284
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:26,619
you know wouldn't you go talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1286
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:30,880

1287
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:34,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">more state in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the local device then in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">term control loop than a fib switchover</font>

1290
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,868
but shorter Jim control loop then going

1291
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,849
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> controller yeah so obviously it's</font>

1292
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:44,920
kind of a sliding scale there that

1293
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:46,300
further my controllers are away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

1294
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,200
devices and the longer the decision

1295
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:51,790
algorithm takes to run the more local

1296
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,200
state i'm going to have to program in

1297
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,359
order to account for these sorts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1298
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,950
failures but honestly if 16 links failed

1299
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,460
on a device<font color="#CCCCCC"> i probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to go away</font>

1300
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:02,049
completely yeah it's not necessarily you

1301
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,700
know 16 links fail on one device it

1302
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:06,670
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead yeah I thought you're sick</font>

1303
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,259
on one device there but yeah yeah no I

1304
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean obviously like if I if</font>

1305
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:13,660
hypothetically i have a bad architecture

1312
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,270

the in the workings here to be improved

for decoupling these two features of

00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:02,560
modern devices that we buy it seems like

1328
00:52:00,819 --> 00:52:04,180
someone's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an opportunity</font>

1329
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">here to write some pretty innovative</font>

1330
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,500
stuff with a control point and I can't

wait to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what we get the other hand</font>

1332
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,069
I'm curious what you might all think

1333
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:14,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the latter part what we could</font>

1334
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:17,890
expect and that is um on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lines of</font>

1335
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:19,210
active networking so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we're</font>

00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this programming just off</font>

1337
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:23,410
into control points today of course GE

1338
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:25,930
research hasn't been touched for like

1339
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the concept is still in my</font>

1340
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:30,578
mind that at some point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1341
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:31,030
kind of division of computation and

00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:32,710
transport

1343
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:35,170
transportation of information itself

1344
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:37,420
becomes blurry and maybe we ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font>

1345
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:40,330
our ourselves here is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any interest</font>

1346
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">in that the future if you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1347
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:45,180
group participants yet to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this state</font>

1348
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:47,890
think about applications being closer to

1349
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,839
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of frameworks versus farther</font>

1350
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:53,710
from them what do you mean my

1351
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:55,690
applications something to mangle some

1352
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:58,330
sort of packet content you mean a

1353
00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:00,930
network application sure me as well

1354
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:03,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's one category of a beyond right</font>

1355
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:07,440
yes I don't know if you if you've seen

1356
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:11,470
the debates that are going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in SD NP</font>

1357
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:15,220
proto list in ITF right now but we

1358
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:19,120
should talk afterwards yeah anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

1359
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:23,080
oh my medicine for the whole panel if

1360
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:25,420
you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it will get</font>

1361
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,890
closer I mean essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> by creating</font>

1362
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,560
this freedom somebody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create</font>

1363
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:32,200
a pathway to to make those closer than

1364
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,250
they currently are and it is the market

1365
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,439
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt it is there going to be</font>

1366
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:38,380
enough value add in that I guess we'll

1367
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,670
have to see well<font color="#E5E5E5"> any model is to refine</font>

1368
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,250
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> did does this look like a</font>

1369
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:44,260
service quote-unquote concept in the

1370
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,790
switch arbitrary interface happens to

1371
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:49,690
route to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs or is there a more</font>

1372
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:51,040
direct path inside this concept to say

1373
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> direct some traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the chassis</font>

1374
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:58,690
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sega negated layer 7 aware device</font>

1375
00:53:53,530 --> 00:54:00,610
or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth like like how do local</font>

1376
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:02,440
services look to this model if that's

1377
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:04,630
even something you consider b-cell

1378
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,130
receptor so that's uh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

1379
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the right way to answer this</font>

1380
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:11,940
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let me just try there's</font>

1381
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:15,009
some work going on that's trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1382
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,350
some kind of melding between what you

1383
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">know these off box control planes the</font>

1384
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:22,690
controllers do and what on box<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trivedi</font>

1385
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:26,650
control plane would do so there are

1386
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">services that we know about today that</font>

1387
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:31,780
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be it might be able to</font>

1388
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">coexist with these other services and</font>

1389
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:36,730
they might not look different or they

1390
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:38,860
might have api's exposed so the pc apu

1391
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:41,530
was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example that I gave there's Alto</font>

1392
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:43,510
and there's you know any other arbitrary

1393
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:44,220
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to do right so</font>

1394
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:47,190
instead

1395
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:49,618
ways there's this hybrid mode that's

1396
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:52,080
that's emerging that kind of is trying

1397
00:54:49,619 --> 00:55:02,010
to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'll be mindful thank</font>

1398
00:54:52,080 --> 00:55:21,960
you done it anyone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

to actually be here during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second</font>

1409
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,099
session of the day right<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the break</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out that survey please so</font>

1416
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:06,259
for yesterday's survey I'd like to hand

1417
