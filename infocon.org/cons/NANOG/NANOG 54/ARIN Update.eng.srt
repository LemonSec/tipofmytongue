9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,039

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,550
possible like five minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,260
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> huberman out in a help desk</font>

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,530

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,040
soon so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm going to do is I'm</font>

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,540
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep this fairly short and and</font>

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:45,989
bring on Leslie's panel after that so

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:51,180
let's go ahead and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started so our</font>

17
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:54,449
focus in in 2012 is dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with ipv4</font>

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,519
depletion and v6 uptake and there's a

19
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,559
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing a lot of</font>

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,719
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are being changed as well</font>

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,809
as improving the processes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,200
in house and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're also doing a lot of</font>

23
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,600
ipv6 up outreach so if you look if you

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,570
go to these various ratios you're likely

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,149
to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron there as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well speaking of</font>

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,490
various vendors to see what where they

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,619
are with ipv6 see if their hardware

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,589
supports v6 of their software supports

29
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,180
b6 and so on and so forth and people are

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting to wake up now and say okay we</font>

31
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,430
have to stop really talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font>

32
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,220
start doing it and we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,770
that actually happen we're implementing

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,908
new policies and services but some of

35
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,979
which are going to get into in a little

36
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,860
bit we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of work on an</font>

37
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,929
errand online<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron used to be this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">people like templates but the world is</font>

40
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,919
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the web and so are we we're</font>

41
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,170
doing work on rpki development which I

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,670
cannot talk about soon and we have

43
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,610
continued participation and never

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet Governance forums so there's</font>

45
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,799
all these organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron's</font>

46
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,508
involved with as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as other regional</font>

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,799
registries and dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with various</font>

48
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,679
organizations that actually want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

49
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,270
impact policies that could affect the

50
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,590
internet and we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

51
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,879
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US government</font>

52
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,849
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> even more that's going on with</font>

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,500
sit and say the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU that Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is aware</font>

54
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:24,869
of as well as many other organizations

55
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,640
that follow these things one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">first questions that people come up</font>

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,440
after they find out that I work for

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,260
Aaron is oh we're running out of ipv4

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,579
space how much do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have left and you</font>

60
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,590
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have quite a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:44,220
there's there's 5.61 / aids available it

62
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,670
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> include</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the quarantine space of</font>

63
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,569
space<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been returned to us for</font>

64
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,609
non-payment or fraud or other issues and

65
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,160
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we still have quite</font>

66
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:01,829
a bit of space left within to give out

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:05,879
to people and you can see that we gave

68
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:09,629
out a lot of space in early last year

69
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,120
and you can see that after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4 run</font>

70
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:15,109
out in terms of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ana not having more</font>

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,220
space to go to the regional registries

72
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,280
one of the things that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

73
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,380
caused with with us with an errand is it

74
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,420
invoked a three-month<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs-based</font>

75
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,250
process so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and no way</font>

76
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask for amount of space for three months</font>

77
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what that actually had what occurred</font>

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,859
as we had some of the slowest time ever

79
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,769
in terms of people asking for v4 space

80
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,989
from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time on and there's now talk</font>

81
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,989
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to increase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the need based</font>

82
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:48,209
policy back to 24 months 24 months of

83
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:51,030
need as opposed to three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months another</font>

84
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,160
interesting graph is<font color="#E5E5E5"> V 6 allocations are</font>

85
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,650
actually been issued again it's also

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,139
going down there was this big uptake

87
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,590
again after the depletion event that

88
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:06,000
occurred in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miami and has just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gone down</font>

89
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:09,769
since then and here's the interesting

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,790
slide in terms of our members who have

91
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:17,760
v4 fils-aime v6 and you can see that V 4

92
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,370
is still predominant share<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I most</font>

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,800
predominant share of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> members and</font>

94
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,960
those that both<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 is increasing</font>

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,030
but not to a great degree about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a third</font>

96
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,030
of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> members have both before v6</font>

97
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,530
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we're doing</font>

98
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:38,840
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron is all the policy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weenies I</font>

99
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:41,369
think does Randy's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bush's new term is is</font>

100
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,340
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> improving number of the v6</font>

101
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,940
policies are available one of the first

102
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,669
ones that they we have enabled on their

103
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,699
behalf is better v 6 allocations for

104
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,919
eyes peas and what this actually

105
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,410
occurred what has<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened as a result</font>

106
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,510
is now we can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> up began to in</font>

107
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,479
amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> space all the way down to or</font>

108
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,130
up to a / 16 so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give out</font>

109
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,930
huge amounts of space now based on this

110
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,870
new policy we had to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

111
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,729
engineering changes based on that which

112
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,610
we just went<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and did about two</font>

113
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:19,050
weeks ago so we're now fully ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

114
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,360
this next thing is we standardized v6 IP

115
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,340
IP reassignment registration

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,340
requirements and you can read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

117
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,479
here's a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proposals that are in</font>

119
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,690
don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about policies but</font>

120
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,889
it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that aren does</font>

122
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:42,810
what was interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this panel on</font>

construct and and if if we're going to

142
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,520
transfer right now we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

143
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,250
mechanism to transfer space from wind

144
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,320
regional registry to another there there

145
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,870
were things done in the past on an ad

146
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,210
hoc basis but that's basically stopped

147
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,030
and now policies are trying to be

148
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,060
concealed by the various

149
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,880
ra our community set to allow this to

150
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:52,370
occur you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's more work</font>

151
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,830
that's required for compliance which the

152
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,230
lawyers actually want justified need for

153
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,990
transfers setting transferred need for

154
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,910
24 months and so on and we had one

155
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,560
abandoned anymore and welcome to look at

156
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:09,020
the list at aaron's website a

157
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,340
public-facing efforts in and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

158
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,719
back into the engineering so I'm much

159
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:17,599
more comfortable and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

160
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,580
we've have done a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of billing work</font>

161
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,410
you can now see your billing contact

162
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,070
with an errand online you are unable to

163
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,620
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that before we're working right now</font>

164
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,380
with integration with our payment vendor

165
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,480
so right now the interface between us

166
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,760
and actually making payments with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

167
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,610
is really awful and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

168
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a more seamless process as well</font>

169
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,030
lots of mistakes are made in that

170
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,540
process right now we're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

171
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that fixed we have lots of almost all</font>

172
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,060
the templates that we have with an

173
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,460
errand with just one exception<font color="#CCCCCC"> our have</font>

174
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,650
restful interfaces now so you can

175
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,599
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> now automate this and we're</font>

176
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more traffic going towards</font>

177
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,440
us we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot more companies that are</font>

178
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,530
starting useless interface as opposed to

179
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,340
templates that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool</font>

180
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,500
another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have is a</font>

181
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,390
specified transfer listing service so

182
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for those people who want to buy</font>

183
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,820
and sell addresses it's been operational

184
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,870
for over a year we have different words

185
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,630
for buyers or kneaders<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lister's sellers</font>

186
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,030
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lister's and brokers which are called</font>

187
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,560
facilitators in this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're</font>

188
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,460
all able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find each other and be able</font>

189
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,760
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make deals there's on the site itself</font>

190
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,530
in terms of what's actually issued it's

191
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,939
not what's actually going on behind the

192
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,500
scenes there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people come to</font>

193
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron the first thing they say is I want</font>

194
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,120
space oh I need to use the specified

195
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,219
transfer listing service to get my space

196
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,530
they don't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can still</font>

197
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,210
basically get it from Aaron that you

198
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,069
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this buying and</font>

199
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:52,460
selling business that's occurring right

200
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,860
now so most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go into that</font>

201
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,750
realize that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right thing</font>

202
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,209
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me just get my space directly</font>

203
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,940
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron and move on another thing</font>

204
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:04,550
that's come out of this community is

205
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that our IR are needed a lot of work and</font>

206
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,540
we made some changes based on that we

207
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,250
not added better security authorization

208
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,410
mechanisms and notification mechanisms

209
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,730
put into place over we're now in line

210
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:22,010
with all the other major<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRRs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still</font>

211
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,829
a sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolt-on it's not integrated</font>

212
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,810
within Aaron systems so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

213
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:28,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">differences but at some day in the</font>

214
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,969
future we like to actually bring that in

215
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,399
line as well now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk about</font>

216
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> value added</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security services these</font>

217
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,600
are services that you really need to

218
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">have if you want to participate in you</font>

219
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,980
need to have signed a agreement with us

220
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,899
it's called a registration services

221
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,970
agreement or if you're a legacy holder

222
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:53,300
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy RSA and we have two systems in</font>

this state first was RPI and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that quite a bit later</font>

225
00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:00,140
we are the only regional registry that's

226
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,029
currently not running rpki and

227
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,730
production the reason we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:06,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">rpi in production is we had a number of</font>

229
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,399
requirements put on us by the Aaron

230
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:11,959
board to reduce liability when that

231
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,010
occurred we had to move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

has actually put us<font color="#CCCCCC"> at your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind</font>

anticipate coming out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything goes</font>

245
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:56,540
well second quarter of this year we have

246
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">two types of systems that we're going to</font>

247
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,449
be plying the first ones hosted where

248
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,290
you basically come to aaron's website

249
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:06,709
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have some sort of two</font>

250
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,240
factor authentication so we know beyond

251
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:11,270
your password who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

252
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,300
are you need to have a public private

253
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:18,500
key combination that is it integrated

254
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,439
within the user interface and but all

255
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,810
the registration all the other work that

256
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,730
goes in with RPG<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually has to add</font>

257
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,589
Aaron the other one is what we call

258
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,420
delegated I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into the</font>

259
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,279
definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later but it allows</font>

260
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,579
ISPs actually do this on their own

261
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,420
hosted machines themselves finally we

262
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:40,010
have DNS SEC this has been fully up

263
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,829
implemented and operational for almost a

264
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,270
year now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is advantaged by either restful</font>

265
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,510
operations or through the user interface

266
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:55,760
and it's available for those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign</font>

267
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:59,029
our say<font color="#CCCCCC"> RL RSA so what I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

268
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:05,750
about now is our traffic loads on who is

269
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:08,330
and who is our<font color="#E5E5E5"> WS and what any of the</font>

270
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin 25 which was in</font>

271
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:13,010
April we had just incredible amount of

272
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,589
traffic actually come towards there we

273
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,450
were seeing traffic that frankly I think

274
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,490
verisign was having a hard time I

275
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,910
wouldn't have seen themselves running

276
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,860
common net with her who has servers and

277
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,050
we saw some really strange behavior in

278
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,660
terms of people asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their same IP</font>

279
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,160
address that they were coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from and</font>

280
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,640
this was increasing over the last year

281
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,709
and we notified that the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

282
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:44,420
this during that meeting and immediately

283
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:47,510
went down at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin 26 which is in</font>

284
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,810
September of that year right before the

285
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,890
meeting we saw this huge spike after a

286
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:55,160
collaboration was announced about open

287
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:58,040
ID collaboration between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and</font>

288
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Yahoo traffic spiked three hundred</font>

289
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,760
percent at that point and we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

290
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">going like oh this is amazing trying to</font>

291
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,880
keep out this traffic and we were seeing

292
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:10,760
a huge amounts of requests asking for

293
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,770
that who owes IP address for these

294
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,319
particular login providers for yahoo AOL

295
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:17,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook and so on and during the height</font>

296
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,270
of this we're seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5600 queries per</font>

297
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,910
second for who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is information during the</font>

298
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,060
day

299
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,560
and here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

300
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,979
uptick and how this happened it was

301
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:33,750
fairly dramatic and it happened over

302
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:36,980
just a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> days but as soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

303
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:40,980
said this after with that meaning it

304
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:44,070
disappeared so we are running at about

305
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,850
2,000 queries per second so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

306
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:51,780
now how are things going now these are

307
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:56,250
old slides I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this we're</font>

308
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:58,740
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> running at about 700 queries</font>

309
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,900
per second now not 2000s what like this

310
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,660
slide has and here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see our stats</font>

311
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,689
on the queries that we have that we've

312
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,760
gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and now we have a fairly</font>

313
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:12,030
interesting decrease down and I'm going

314
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a little bit here you</font>

315
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,560
have our v6 traffic you notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

316
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,170
legends totally changed and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

317
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,369
it on the same graph as a v4 address

318
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,000
space because you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to see</font>

319
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it because it's flatlined v6 but traffic</font>

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,150
is at who is queries going over our v6

321
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,190
interfaces is a fraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

322
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,189
what we see over our before<font color="#E5E5E5"> in places</font>

323
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:43,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and whatever small slice it was going to</font>

324
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,670
show you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> well one of the things that</font>

325
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak to it one of the things</font>

326
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have is a restful interface for</font>

327
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:52,500
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is information and is currently</font>

328
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,600
seeing as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic as our port 43</font>

329
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,060
traffic off the traditional who is

330
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">service and what's interesting about</font>

331
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,449
that is that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

332
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,280
programming their directory service

333
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,890
information using this restful interface

334
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,380
as opposed to who is now and so we've

335
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,730
reached the gap where we're no longer

336
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,740
having this traditional who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is service</font>

337
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,480
where everybody has to his clients to

338
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,190
ask this information but people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

339
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,290
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the next level in</font>

340
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,210
using the restful interface which i

341
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,920
think is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool because we're</font>

342
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,860
finally getting to the point of getting

343
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,870
rid of this old archaic public directory

344
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:31,740
service and moving on to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next realm</font>

345
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:33,600
so we have so in essence if you guys are

346
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,590
interested in directory services there's

347
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,190
actually some work

348
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,190
ITF and dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and and were</font>

349
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:46,140
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with various domain registries</font>

350
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,240
and so on actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this a</font>

351
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,540
standardized effort so that we can move

352
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">beyond who is we have two upcoming Erin</font>

355
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:05,550
registration is open for that and you're

356
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:07,080
more and welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join and one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

358
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:14,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">behalf of our communications department</font>

359
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:16,500
is that we have these smaller groups our

360
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,000
meetings that we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get together in</font>

361
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,920
various regions we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

362
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,710
meeting of<font color="#CCCCCC"> brooklyn for what's called</font>

Aaron on the road on march six please<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

364
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,410
look at our website if you won't like to

365
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,690
go ahead and participate and we're also

366
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:37,770
joining up with nanog and in the fall

367
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:40,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dallas so are there any questions so</font>

368
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">I put you all asleep this is really good</font>

369
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:49,370
it wasn't me it was the party last night

370
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,370
wasn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oh jared has a question</font>

371
00:16:50,420 --> 00:17:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Third Watch new start so I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering</font>

372
00:16:53,580 --> 00:17:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">why you used a programmable hsm and and</font>

373
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,450
what the barriers were in that compared

374
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other regions who did our have</font>

375
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:11,730
deployment rpki solutions that are

376
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,720
available to their regions because that

377
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:18,450
has perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> set back the industry</font>

378
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,980
significantly as a consequence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

379
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:23,520
wondering why<font color="#CCCCCC"> you made that decision in</font>

380
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,709
why you you ended up there versus

381
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,060
perhaps spending a year beating your

382
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,530
head against the wall with technology

383
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,460
decided that maybe we should just do

384
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">what everyone else is doing ok so our</font>

385
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,460
board seem to be more concerned about

386
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,399
liability than perhaps on to other

387
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,110
regional registries actually they were

388
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,150
asking us in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you have</font>

389
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,290
these concerns tell us about it because

390
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,650
we didn't consider this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves</font>

391
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:53,770
the two things that that the board asked

392
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:56,950
were specifically one was when you went

393
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:00,300
in using RPG I system to issue a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rolla</font>

394
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:04,480
we didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it came from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

395
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:08,639
that I didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it came from you</font>

396
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:11,590
it yourself so so we had to put in a

397
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,790
basically in her face that says okay

398
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:18,820
this guy here is issued aroa and we have

399
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,870
he signed it and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the public key</font>

400
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,480
that's associated with that particular

401
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,370
users so we can feel confident that that

402
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,650
person is actually signed a pro and it's

403
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,649
actually integrated within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HSM the</font>

404
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,590
other thing that we did is that we with

405
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:35,170
the logging site we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have signed</font>

406
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:38,439
all or logging events and there's no way

407
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,720
to compromise as well so in the case say

408
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,460
I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in and do some</font>

409
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,800
surreptitious activity I would just

410
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">erase the logs or do whatever I can't do</font>

411
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,879
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now okay and you you don't believe</font>

412
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other rpki regions that are</font>

413
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,740
doing this that you you believe that

414
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're deficient in that capability</font>

415
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,910
they're all our<font color="#CCCCCC"> regions are a little bit</font>

416
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,330
different in terms of the our

417
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:08,080
constituencies and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I all I</font>

418
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:10,000
know is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they Jeff didn't set me up</font>

419
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,790
by the way oh did he good for it good we

420
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,250
do it for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yet yeah he did not oh</font>

421
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:18,159
he didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay he did not I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort</font>

422
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,390
of asking this question because it seems

423
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a difference between the regions</font>

424
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:25,750
and usually that the rirs have

425
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,030
traditionally in my mind at least and

426
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,240
maybe that's just in my mind worked

427
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:33,220
closely together to provide similar type

428
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,040
services and collaborate on that so I'm

429
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,420
kind of curious why the Aaron region is

430
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,129
unique in the global Internet

431
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,990
infrastructure as it relates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

432
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,580
yeah so this this whole thing Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You</font>

433
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:46,150
Jared so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's two things</font>

434
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,550
regarding that one is is that our board

435
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,640
actually asked us to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we felt</font>

436
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,050
compelled to we need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that change</font>

437
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,720
the other thing which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

438
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,790
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is then that talk on on on</font>

439
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,220
Monday<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning during that panel you</font>

440
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,420
were starting to be exposed summit to

441
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,100
some of the difference

442
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,310
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the regional registries and</font>

443
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,020
actually Jeff brought that up so so

444
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,899
there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are differences</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

445
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,480
regional registries and how we look at

446
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,160
things we do similar operations but

447
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,350
based on regional differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

448
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,750
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there are differences between</font>

449
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:24,070
the operations Jeff Houston AP neck it's

450
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,690
like all good brothers and sisters we

451
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,770
scratch each other's eyes out in the

452
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:33,190
dark we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> went with the lunar SI</font>

453
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:35,889
hsm why because we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole</font>

454
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,110
thing based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> open SSL libraries lunar</font>

455
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">HSM works well with it there are real</font>

limitations in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lunar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sa HSM</font>

457

including the number of keys you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

458
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:48,250
store so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in AP neck when we</font>

459
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go down hosting solutions the</font>

460
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,020

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I can't stuff at all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

463
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,070
thousands and thousands of keys in the

464
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,950
box so the engineering actually differs

465
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,450
RI r by r AR at this point because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,580
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the profile of the</font>

467
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,970
services were offering are subtly

468
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:13,330
different you really should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be reading</font>

469
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,860
very carefully the certificate practice

470

statements issued and published by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

471
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,219
rirs to make sure you understand

472
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,660
precisely what our undertakings are

473
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,090
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite diligent in</font>

474
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,250
preparing those CBS statements to

475
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,159
accurately describe what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

476
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,770
undertaking to do and equally if it's

477
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,350
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we're probably not undertaking</font>

478
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:38,050
to do it so look very<font color="#E5E5E5"> carefully and when</font>

479
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,659
you're seeing do i outsource my key

482
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,850
decision you should think<font color="#E5E5E5"> long and hard</font>

483
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,500
about in your organization because you

484
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">are outsourcing some pretty critical</font>

485
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:57,250
assets about your control over those

486
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:59,860
numbering resources if you're a two-man

487
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,900
outfit mum and dad's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP you might want</font>

488
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,419
to outsource if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be one of</font>

489
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,740
the major telcos on this planet<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

490
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,780
you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think very hard about</font>

491
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,270
how you actually outsource and how you

492
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,700
do stuff in-house and my recommendation

493
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,270
would be it is honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> your security</font>

494
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,490
you know

495
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:21,850
deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yourself so to that end the</font>

496
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">CPS is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff has mentioned the ones</font>

497
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,949
i have read we're all subtly different

498
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,750
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP nick has one ripe has one we've</font>

499
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,970
generated our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> cps and they're all</font>

500
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,800
frankly a little bit different so there

501
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">are differences in the operational sort</font>

502
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,940
of aspects of how this is done one of

503
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,540
the things i also want to mention is

504
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all is not lost in rpi world as it</font>

505
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,190
comes to working in the air in region we

506
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,200
do a heavy pilot<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been out there</font>

507
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,180
the intention was only to have it out

508
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,340
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> for six months it's being a year</font>

509
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,970
and a half it's running fine you're more

510
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:58,540
welcome to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join it is rpki pilot at Air</font>

519
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible just like a 45 second update</font>

525
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:43,270
data into it but there's since you do

526
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,940
not publish the trust anchor nobody can

527
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,800
get data out of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know if</font>

528
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,200
the data is actually in other than

00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:54,840
there's a web interface yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't use</font>

with relying party software and stuff it

533
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:10,719
up a router to test so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a right</font>

534
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:14,440
only black<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole okay and we'd appreciate</font>

the service just<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish the trust</font>

537
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,740

538
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,860
you're welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wrap as many lawyers</font>

as you want to round it enjoy yourself

540
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:30,250
yeah so so to that end I'd like to talk

541
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,830
a little bit what what Randy is talking

542
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">about he asked for the trust anchor and</font>

543
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I said that the trust anchor to</font>

544
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:41,350
Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> at via email there's what are the</font>

545
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,870
other things and that happened in this

546
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation is theirs there are some</font>

547
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:49,120
talk about this trust anchor needs to be

548
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,449
acknowledged by those people who plan on

549
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,639
validating against that that they're

550
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,920
sort of some liability minute great

551
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">gation put into place I'm not a lawyer</font>

552
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,440
but that's one of the things that's been

553
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,678
bantered about within<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our community</font>

554
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,679
as well

555
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:15,649
bugatchi telecom well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that</font>

556
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:19,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ping-pong actually makes me ask well</font>

557
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:23,649
okay what is well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in other regions</font>

558
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:27,140
in other regions actually the pilot

559
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:30,350
morphed straight forward into the

560
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">production service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

around with actually are supposed to to

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:45,709
describe real assets and result in

564
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:50,418
actual filtering not all participants

565
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:54,770
actually understood that the question

566
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:59,419
here is quite clearly so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pilot</font>

567
00:25:54,770 --> 00:26:02,450
has been only sent box play data and as

568

yours as you as your concern to blog

569
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:08,630
about liability is very clear statement

590
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,210
initially coming out with a hosted
