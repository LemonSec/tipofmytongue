we value that information very much as

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:48,440
Craig welcome okay what am i doing wrong

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,440
person

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,480
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wait for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides to come up</font>

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,839
today I'm going to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about a</font>

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,990
mystery a mystery that's plagued me for

16
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,450
the last several years two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I</font>

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,850
did a bunch of work looking at how the

18
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,130
internet was evolving how the major

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,229
hyper Giants the major traffic players

20
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,009
were consolidating<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet traffic was</font>

21
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:23,740
changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> build-out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs and exchange</font>

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,240
points and when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that work it</font>

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,550
was pretty clear what the top fifty

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,589
percent of internet traffic was there

25
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,750
was a hyper Giants there was all the

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,940
properties my mother and my wife knew

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,789
about the facebooks the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google's of the</font>

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,100
world but as I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that work there</font>

29
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:41,800
was always a strange element very large

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,960
traffic volumes that weren't part of the

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,840
hyper Giants in fact as I look for them

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,809
they weren't part of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-publicized</font>

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,600
websites or properties rather big

34
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,970
mysteries so this work is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:01,660
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other fifty percent of internet</font>

36
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:03,069
traffic so as I said it became clear as

37
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,700
I was doing something earlier work about

38
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:09,399
2010 that the same asn same site or

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,440
block same data centers kept showing up

40
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,940
again and again and again in the data

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's never quite clear to me who</font>

42
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,140
these folks were what they did why they

43
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,730
actually some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these folks had like</font>

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,589
one or two percent of all internet

45
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,019
traffic it was going to some of these

46
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">ASNs on these data centers but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

47
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,680
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page they had these</font>

48
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,620
small little European companies as

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,700
customers that I never heard of it

50
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,760
clearly wasn't these little companies

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,099
selling tires and widgets and umbrellas

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,870
that were generating one to two percent

53
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:46,660
of all internet traffic so spent a lot

54
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,120
of time asking around I asked all the

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,400
major operators I asked lots of folks in

56
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NAND</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out community you know I'm</font>

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,810
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> these asn do you know why they</font>

58
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,020
have this number of terabits per second

59
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,840
of traffic and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the nice thing</font>

60
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:06,430
about the Nanta community is asking

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,260
around everyone had theories and you

62
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,080
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other nice thing that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana</font>

community

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,770
is that not only do their theories but

65
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,770
they're pretty sure of their theories

66
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,119
but when you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask them great so</font>

67
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">leaseweb is doing this how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,640
that generally it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shrug but they</font>

69
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,220
would insist even more strenuously than

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,559
fact their theory<font color="#CCCCCC"> was was accurate as</font>

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,730
I'm sure many of you know arguing with

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">your colleagues so the mystery was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

73
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,660
is all this traffic coming from if you

74
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,190
actually look at net flow you generally

75
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">come up empty these are you know</font>

76
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,109
millions and hundreds of thousands of

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">different IP addresses typically all</font>

you much some of the sites actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

82
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,400
out of their way to obfuscate their

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,760
business or obfuscated their ownership

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,040
structure some using short-lived DNS if

85
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,070
you go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites often you'll get</font>

in the load balancer or more frequently

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,480
than not you'll get insulted this is you

88
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,690
know you're you're too stupid this site

91

today all will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> revealed I will tell</font>

92
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,980
you what is the other fifty percent of

93
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">the traffic where it's going and in fact</font>

94
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,910
as my colleague likes to joke it turns

95
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,669
out i have an exhaustive list of many of

96
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,890
these sites now it took a bunch of work

97
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:41,810
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took us a few months we</font>

98
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually did a lot of stuff it turns out</font>

99
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,460
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one thing to actually identify</font>

100
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,630
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these major sites you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

101
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,030
a variety of techniques techniques

102
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,969
combined them together there's math

103
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,099
involved and this is not a methodology

104
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,680
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll do a paper and those more</font>

105
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,110
academic bent can attend those types of

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,760
conferences but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we spend a while</font>

107
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,540
collecting data doing a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,090
spinning up VMs around the world and we

109
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,030
found out who those fifty percent of

110
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,830
internet traffic work this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make explicit that will be</font>

114
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,490
talking about sites that have varying

115
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,068
degrees of morality

116
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,960
legality I have no well I do have

117
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:28,819
opinions on these but the talk isn't

118
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,219
about those opinions and we're not

119
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting into any of the copyright or</font>

120
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,380
other issues we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a blog post</font>

121
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">today that's out with a little more</font>

122
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,830
detail and we will have a paper coming

123
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,199
out shortly so now I know the suspense

124
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,419
is building what is this fifty percent

125
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,780
of internet traffic who is it where is

126
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from well the conventional</font>

127
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,770
wisdom I'll give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer now it</font>

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,590
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> file-sharing p2p in adult video is a</font>

129
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,690
massive volume of internet traffic

130
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:06,049
shocking I know to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you in the</font>

131
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,909
audience but what's really interesting I

132
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,370
think about this massive traffic volume

133
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,349
is that the conventional wisdom at least

134
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,409
you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk to folks or hacker</font>

135
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:17,270
news or slashdot is that you know adult

136
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:20,060
video is everywhere every nook and

137
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,549
cranny<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet same with</font>

the place<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely distributed and it</font>

140
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:30,919
turns out as you look at the data what

141
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,469
really is the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> striking thing as you</font>

142
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:37,370
look through these you know terabytes

143
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:39,889
and terabytes of data is that no in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

144
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,080
far from being spread out you have in

145
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:44,150
all of these industries all these more

146
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,400
or less niche industries you have

147
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,580

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,539
of hosting providers Colo providers and

149
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:56,810
providers they all use more or less the

150
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,159
same folks and you see similar things in

151
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,469
other industries because many of these

152
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:02,000
have specialized needs you know it's

model but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again very very I think</font>

157
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,520
centralized infrastructure so this talk

158
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:19,159
this talk is a brief tour of a very

159
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,979
large volume of internet traffic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

160
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:24,699
actually supported by a surprisingly at

161

least to me very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,330

focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> file-sharing p2p an adult</font>

164
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:36,010

165
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure that supports it</font>

166
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,878
so first file sharing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit hard to</font>

167
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:42,349
define at least you know the New York

168
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,959
Times had kind of an interesting piece

169
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:47,479
around the megaupload the piece was all

170
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,129
about how do you know all the sites look

171
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,849
alike you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">turns out that I think at least it</font>

175
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:02,300
superficially that's true if you go to

176
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">any of the file sharing websites they</font>

notices and staunch warnings against

184
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,129
file sharing is not allowed here even

185
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:27,139
though that's 99% of other business and

186
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,909
but rather than get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business of</font>

187

what is file showing or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what</font>

188
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:33,948
we decide to do in this talk is allow

189
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:36,799
the industry to self classify so if you

190
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:39,348
go to one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hundred of file-sharing</font>

195
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:51,349
these search sites and in turn these

196
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:53,479
search sites point to the file sharing

197
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,970
hosting sites there's a couple hundred

198
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them generally though I've yet to</font>

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">find and looking at 50 or 60 of these we</font>

202
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,430
they all actually point to the same set

203
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,720
of other hosting providers so if you

204
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,939
have any mystery or you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

206
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:18,170

207
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,110
and it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> help with some of the</font>

208
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,139
confusion the only other note I'd have

209
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,660
is please don't actually download man on

210

a ledge if for no other reason it's an

211
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,769
awful movie

212
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,479
I should also<font color="#CCCCCC"> point out the file sharing</font>

213
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:37,089
sites have a very different notion of

214
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,339
verified than I have some of these

215
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:42,279
actually go to files but they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

appropriate some of the things behind

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:53,949
these links for a mixed professional

220
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:55,149
audience so<font color="#CCCCCC"> file-sharing I don't have</font>

221
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,459
enough time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into it but it's a</font>

222
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,410
fascinating business model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as with</font>

223
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:01,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">other industries you very specialized</font>

partners very specialized ecosystem as

225
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:05,320
the money flows through it but generally

226
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,690
breaks down into a couple of categories

227
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,360
of advertisement supported you've the

228
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,220
folks that are actually paid for search

229
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,139
you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to pay them ten</font>

230
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,589
dollars before they'll actually give you

231
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:19,149
the hidden URL in rapidshare or

232
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,279
previously megaupload or filesonic

233
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:23,019
there's others that you just pay to

234
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,389
actually access the file or for the

235
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,820
storage so really kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting</font>

00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:29,529
business model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spent uh this</font>

237
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,790
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the talk but spend a bunch</font>

238
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,100
of time looking who are the different

239
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,709
partners how they interacted and what's

240
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,790
the money flow through this particular

241
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:42,279
industry so final shooting overall huge

242
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,199
part of internet traffic it depends

243
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,079
where you measure but broadly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> North</font>

244
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:49,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">America up to ten percent at any given</font>

245
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,699
time of all consumer traffic generally

246
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,768
though from a fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> small percentage of</font>

247
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:59,140
consumers about one to two percent of

248
00:10:53,769 --> 00:11:01,390
actual and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some consumer subscribers</font>

249
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,550
and you know had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar</font>

250
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,250
patterns in terms of diurnal nature and

251
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:09,760
some other sort of stationary properties

252
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:12,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer-to-peer but the most interesting</font>

253
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,980
slide is this one or this in the next

254
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:17,529
one so the real question is you know

255
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">file-sharing it's all over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet</font>

256
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:22,089
there's hundreds of different file

257
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,500
sharing sites but what's amazing is

258
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:29,260
these hundreds of file sharing sites all

259
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,750
use the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> colos and it's not</font>

260
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,120
particular it's that this is how these

261
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,550
industries<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve and there's a variety</font>

262
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">of reasons why this happens but I can't</font>

263
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,180
actually read my slide in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me</font>

264
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,059
nor can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read that but I'll do this</font>

265
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:46,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">from memory this is the slide from</font>

266
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:49,269
18 2012 in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours just before the</font>

267
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:53,829
coordinated global raid on megaupload

00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:56,609
and dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> get his name Kim calm which I</font>

269
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:59,679
always thought was a fantastic name

270
00:11:56,609 --> 00:12:03,459
you'll see that Jerry teeth megaupload

271
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:05,559
was the giant megaupload owned about

272
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,618
thirty forty percent of all file-sharing

<font color="#CCCCCC">leaseweb and a few other providers and</font>

275
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,439
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else was pretty</font>

276
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:17,348
far behind you had you know putlocker a

277
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:18,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of other folks and I didn't have</font>

278
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,959
enough room<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the slide to list</font>

279
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,209
everyone but they're generally in the

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,888
<font color="#E5E5E5">other bucket but when you look at where</font>

281
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,978
they're all going again it's the same

282
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:30,009
data centers the same hosting providers

283
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:32,669
not a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a variety</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or Hetrick</font>

284
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:35,259
you know it's pretty homogeneous set

285
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,419
though as I said it actually takes quite

286
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:39,399
a bit of effort to identify not only

287
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:42,549
what's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> file-sharing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site but the the</font>

288
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:47,889

<font color="#CCCCCC">January 18 2012 and then in a matter of</font>

hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global file sharing world</font>

internet traffic dropped overnight at

293
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:04,929
least for an hour or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and for some of</font>

294
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:09,519
the other file sharing sites this was a

295
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:11,228
gold mine so who won who are the winners

296
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,929
or losers if there's winners or losers

297
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:15,999
in this well putlocker really came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

298
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:17,619
ahead I don't really have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

299
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:19,749
insight into<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they've been reading a</font>

300
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:20,949
lot of the discussion you know if you

301
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:23,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually search for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

302
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:24,699
you know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

303
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,889
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different file sharing focus on</font>

304
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:30,159
why they prefer one site over another

305
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:32,559
but putlocker came out ahead the

306
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,209
industry kind of rejiggered and today

307
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,718
we're basically back up the same traffic

308
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:39,699
level though you know we're not using

309
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:42,369
Carpathia anymore and said it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaseweb</font>

310
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:46,169
and a few other providers enter the top

311
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:51,549
10 or so of the global<font color="#CCCCCC"> file sharing</font>

312
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:52,720
traffic sources so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

313
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:54,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting about file sharing is</font>

314
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,229
there's hundreds of distinct domain

315
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:57,000
names out there if you actually spend

316
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,350
some time you

317
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,240
find out that many of these domain names

318
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what looks like separate companies</font>

319
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,470
are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the same company</font>

320
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,870
generally it's pretty hard to tell with

321
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,090
adult video and file sharing what the

322
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,680
corporate structure is generally I only

323
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,840
get a really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea when they sue</font>

324
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,109
each other because the court documents

325
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,550
the ownership structure comes out a bit

326
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:20,100
but really you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got ten of these sites</font>

327
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:23,010
contribute seventy percent and you just

328
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,680
add<font color="#CCCCCC"> four kolos you know leaseweb troopa</font>

329
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,800
a few others basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> owned eighty-five</font>

330
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,839
percent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> file-sharing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> market so</font>

331
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,609
not very distributed highly highly

332
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:37,890
localized and putlocker the new winner

333
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,660
so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> segue I don't know how it's</font>

334
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,000
a segue but I'll move into adult video

335
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,709
now and again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not making any moral</font>

336
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">judgment these are just very large</font>

337
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,130
traffic sources that often aren't

338
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,770
documented aren't discussed and

339
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,480
certainly if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LeaseWeb</font>

340
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,290
homepage you know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really</font>

341
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,840
advertising who their major<font color="#E5E5E5"> file-sharing</font>

342
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,459
customers are but the adult video world

343
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">also is really really interesting</font>

344
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,320
economy how they do the link sharing and

345
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the file sharing what's interesting to</font>

346
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,480
me is most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic is CDN based</font>

347
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,600
all the drm all the billing and all the

348
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,970
other stuff comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a very very small</font>

349
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,210
number of specialized players again<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

350
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,950
specialized ecosystem most of the actual

351
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:23,280
traffic volume which again is video

352
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,290
comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the CD ends and what's kind</font>

353
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cute is the CD ends make an effort to</font>

354
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,760
generally segment all of the red light

355
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,089
traffic is in its own little cider

356
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,500
blocks own little<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns hierarchy you know</font>

357
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,960
whenever you reach any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these you</font>

358
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,550
might not recognize the site name but

359
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,570
you know that anything in these blocks

360
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:44,069
is adult video most of the CD ends are

361
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,560
involved at least to some degree in

362
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,870
adult video and again you know no crime

363
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,579
not making any judgment though it is

364
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,800
interesting folks like Akamai have

365
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,690
clearly decided it's just not part of

366
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">their business model which you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

367
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a luxury of the market leader perhaps</font>

368
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,890
but as with the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> file-sharing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

369
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's specialized market and even you</font>

370
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,040
know what you notice as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look through</font>

371
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,560
the different websites the file sharing

372
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,120
the pwc box folks are

373
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,099
all trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell they all have</font>

374

messaging but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to they're</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very direct none of the file-sharing</font>

00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,900
large<font color="#CCCCCC"> kolos come out and say you know</font>

377
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,210
we're supportive of this industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

378
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,220
is what we do similarly with adult you

379
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,279
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fit if this I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font>

380
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,050
in force you have things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

381
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,700
we don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you stream when you</font>

382
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,469
stream how you stream you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can stream</font>

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">with us just please don't Blake break</font>

384
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,980
any international laws and again

385
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:44,279
specialized payment hosting providers as

386
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,870
well this is what adult video looks like

387
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,610
today as you look at the underlying

388
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:52,440
infrastructure there are thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

389
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,670
thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different domain names in</font>

390
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,860
URLs it turns out every fetish gets its

391
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:05,129
own URL and own domain name and by the

392
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:07,199
way there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of fetishes but the</font>

393
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,480
major players our xvideo tends to be one

394
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,699
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> largest ones followed by free</font>

395
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,800
cams and again fairly well distributed

396
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,620
but what's interesting if you look at

397
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red lines that's the drm the payment</font>

398
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,678
the control traffic all going to the

399
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:24,060
same specialized providers typically

400
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll you know most of their year a lot</font>

401
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,610
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are European and then we have</font>

402
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:33,720
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the global cdns number one two three</font>

403
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:35,580
and four anonymized<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know not we're not</font>

404
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,400
naming names at least of folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

405
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,280
might be in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience so that's</font>

406
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:47,220
adult traffic and I'll finish off the

407
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:54,810
talk with the rise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fall and rise of</font>

408
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:57,060
p2p so p2p used to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> massive p2p back</font>

409
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,980
you know seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago was going to be</font>

410
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,470
the end of the internet circuits were

411
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,370
filling up the world was ending folk

412
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:08,340
stars are deployed DPI you know it was a

413
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,620
huge huge problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then for a variety</font>

414
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:16,379
of reasons including carriers throttling

415
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:18,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">raa notices that p2p just was awful you</font>

416
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,900
know the performance and you know they

417
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,179
declined overall globally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found that</font>

418
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,950
in some of the research work I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

419
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,749
and a number of other commercial

420
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,509
companies and researchers all documented

421
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:32,730
the rather steep decline and that's the

422
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:35,929
kind of graph on the right there left

423
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,009
depending so p2p was declining

424
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,779
disappearing as a major source still

425
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:41,820
sizable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some networks twenty percent</font>

426
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,580
but overall the trend was clear file

427
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,509
sharing was being replaced by zooming

428
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:54,269
p2p was being replaced by<font color="#CCCCCC"> file-sharing</font>

429
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:59,580
but then the world changed again what

430
00:18:54,269 --> 00:19:01,889
changed the cloud and HD and blu-ray

431
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,189
movies changed as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well forcing the video</font>

432
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:07,110
requirements so p2p was awful I know

433
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,299
none of you you know use p2p to download

434
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">movies but if you had tried you could</font>

435
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,990
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours to find out you didn't get</font>

436
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:15,389
the movie you expected it was so much

<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest observation i have is about</font>

escaping me but we can track the

00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:08,679
some point there was a quantum change in

the type of traffic or as in the

that uh you know I I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a fair</font>

580
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,100
question I think

581
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,160
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those hosters in this</font>

582
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,429
room there's only some of those CD ads

583
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,080
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room so it's kind of interesting</font>

584
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,370
direction to go with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you know</font>

585
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,730
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a fair question initially</font>

586
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:06,489
we had had no names and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it looked a</font>

587
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:13,540
little silly so but I think I think it's

588
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:15,970
a fair question but no answer you know I

589
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,200
I could I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just leave you too Randy</font>

590
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:24,340
because I'm sure he'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have something</font>

591
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">pedantic Randy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush i J um I hope you're</font>

592
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do the longitudinal because</font>

593
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:34,570
there are some interesting aspects what

594
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:40,199
will be the reaction to the megaupload

595
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:43,270
takedown<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how will the market and the</font>

596
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology they use respond to that will</font>

597
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:53,580
they distribute more will they go to

598
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:56,139
bittorrent more what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen I</font>

599
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:59,199
presume megaupload got taken down

600
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,320
because you or somebody like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you with</font>

601
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,760
connections to Leo looked and said

602
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,250
there's the biggest one let's go shoot

603
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:13,960
it the other side is have you looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

604
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:16,660
the payment flow and how that's done

605
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,960
because it's pretty amazing i learned a

606
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:23,740
little about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> by accident by picking a</font>

607
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,950
random partner dinner and they happened

608
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,169
to be in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payment industry for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

609
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:34,419
adult market and that's very

610
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:36,850
concentrated and it's very it's pretty

611
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:41,110
different it's pretty different and I

612
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:44,020
once had lunch with up again I can I you

613
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:46,479
know it's all about meals for me um it's

614
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,918
um had lunch with a an adult content

615
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,460
provider and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in America</font>

616
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:57,640
most of the adult content providers

617
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,520
ownership lives in Florida because

618
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,250
Florida

619
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,650
state law says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot</font>

620
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:08,700
confiscate somebody's primary residence

621
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:10,830
so they all have enormous assets

622
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,320
involved in their primary residence in

623
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,300
Florida I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all weird stuff</font>

624
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,830
yeah you know I knew it was mostly

625
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,780
busines Florida<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I thought it was the</font>

626
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:23,820
weather I hadn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard that no it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

627
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,500
it's because they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your</font>

628
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,629
primary residence you build a

629
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,590
ten-million-dollar primary residence and

630
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:33,090
their assets yeah so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer the</font>

631
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:37,110
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only remember one of them</font>

632
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:38,600
now I I was not involved the record I

633
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,649
had nothing to do with the megaupload

634
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,830
takedown we were looking at this this

635
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:46,230
before but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing at all to do</font>

636
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,669
with us and then yeah I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

637
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,920
what your second question wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font>

638
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">does anyone the audience remember since</font>

639
00:28:49,920 --> 00:29:00,390
he's walk away ah yeah I remember now

640
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:04,320
he's people aren't stupid then there's a

641
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:07,650
lot of money involved um so the they're

642
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,000
going to react and there I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

643
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,410
they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business model</font>

644
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,260
but they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change technology</font>

645
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:15,630
model I presume yeah and will it spread

646
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,760
to more differs of distributed hosting

647
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,790
well it spread to more<font color="#E5E5E5"> P&P will the</font>

648
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,470
payment channels change etc yeah you

649
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,180
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's interesting to watch</font>

650
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,000
you know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lawyer but</font>

651
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really I think</font>

652
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,180
megaupload really was different in the

653
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,810
degree they didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much an</font>

654
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:36,630
effort to I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> obscure what really</font>

655
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,909
was a core business proposition you know

656
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:41,460
all the others really do I believe have

657
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:44,070
legitimate you know some legitimate

658
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,570
business and there's safe harbor and you

659
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,179
know just looking at the website it's

660
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:51,060
very hard to tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what business</font>

661
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">there they're in so you know I think you</font>

663
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,880
things interact with each other change

664
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,470
you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you'll see as</font>

665
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,210
much that's immediately available on a

666
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,880
google search bringing up the latest
