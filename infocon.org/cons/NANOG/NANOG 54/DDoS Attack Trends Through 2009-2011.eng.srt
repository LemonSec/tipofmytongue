data in this case we're working a bunch

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data from our outlets providers and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problem and we do share it out in forums</font>

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,849
like this and continuously in or out

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,010
less portal so that we can make sure

<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all basically saying on top</font>

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,500
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so in this talk I'm going</font>

25
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,460
to talk about three different major data

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,200
sets the first is actual attack traffic

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,570
that comes out of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymize</font>

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,430
statistics these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> our peak flow</font>

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,199
systems operated by folks like

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,509
yourselves and others around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,979
that have voluntarily decided to submit

32
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,540
anonymized data the upside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and downside</font>

33
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:33,299
is pretty obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upside is its</font>

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,710
global it gives just a very wide view

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,130
the downside<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's a rather</font>

36
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,899
self-selected group meaning we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

37
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,640
of bias in some places and weak and

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,829
others and over<font color="#CCCCCC"> oversampling in some</font>

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,649
places and the like all those sort of

40
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,759
classic problems you might expect second

41
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,189
data source<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to be talking</font>

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,990
about in some of this data here is from

43
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,158
a project we have a long-running project

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,619
my team is we're running called blade

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,619
runner this is an active botnet tracking

46
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,320
project where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually impersonate</font>

47
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,420
box using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python code recording the</font>

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,158
commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the intended victims</font>

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,649
and profiling that way looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where</font>

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,770
the CNCs are the duration of the attacks

51
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like and finally a role about</font>

52
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,010
infrastructure security report the

53
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,170
edition was actually released this

54
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,649
morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on our website this is</font>

55
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,030
survey data so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> again global this</font>

56
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">is dozens of participants around the</font>

57
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,810
world who report several different

58
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,730
questions data about that and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

59
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some data sprinkled in from there</font>

60
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,518
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so all different three pieces</font>

61
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,048
there for the 2011 survey that just came

62
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,989
out this morning there's some key

63
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:42,299
findings here you know standard line for

64
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:45,239
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us right any inner can be the</font>

65
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:48,299
target protein analysis attack people

66
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,790
still in 2011-2012 so it can convince

67
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:53,579
some cases when it won't affect us<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

68
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing really valuable here the fact</font>

69
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:59,579
the matter is basically everybody's a

70
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,619
target we're also seeing that the size

71
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,480
and scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attacks is increasing</font>

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,909
or they continue to grow rather although

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,319
the peak size for the year was actually

74
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:10,440
down I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that a little</font>

75
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever reported ipv6</font>

76
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,640
no service attack in the wild and

77
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,459
production network that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> reported to</font>

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,399
us although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot independently</font>

79
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:23,790
corroborate we are seeing attackers of

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,130
course go where the money is some things

81
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,510
I won't be covering<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so wireless</font>

82
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,910
networks and continued uncertainty<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

83
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,828
mobile handsets and the like and then

84
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,109
there are course and trust issues across

85
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not international boundaries sort of</font>

86
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:37,739
get to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the meat of it again</font>

87
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,448
keeping this as much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible on</font>

88
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,609
track so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a chart showing the</font>

89
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:48,000
motivations that have been inferred out

90
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:50,430
of the attacks either through reports

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,629
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been posted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> online email</font>

92
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,919
messages received etc inferring the

93
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,198
motivations for the attacker versus the

94
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,579
victim and looking at this chart the

95
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,750
number ones these political and

96
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:05,459
ideological motivations here topping off

97
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,190
to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty five percent of the</font>

98
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,370
reports that people have talked about

99
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and of course the next one being</font>

100
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,150
sort of this we call nihilism or

101
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,829
vandalism basically to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lashing</font>

102
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,519
out if you will anybody who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

103
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">knows I'm very very fascinated by these</font>

104
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,010
ideologically politically motivated

105
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,780
attacks specifically around nation

106
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,520
states and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber NGO conflict</font>

107
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,559
acting on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sri on the cyber realm so this</font>

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,250
for me is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> fascinating this isn't</font>

109
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,350
necessarily you know more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Estonian</font>

110
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,270
attacks more russia vs georgia kinds of

111
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,760
things rather driven largely by the

112
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,830
anonymous group so we've seen them sort

113
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,070
of striking out continual again again

114
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,510
and again so again this is sort of an

115
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:51,550
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding out of the report</font>

116
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,690
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure have something you guys</font>

117
00:04:51,550 --> 00:05:05,919
are laughing up with right here son

118
00:04:52,690 --> 00:05:07,900
what's oh yeah yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

119
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,060

120
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">are sniffing about cuz yes it has</font>

121
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened i recall an early research</font>

122
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,400
project my first get to arbor there was

123
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,919
somebody who would configured dscp we

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,429
saw below back into our sink hole during

125
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:27,789
the attack very nice little

126
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,350
amplification there and cute yeah this

127
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,200
does happen from time to time and does

128
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,840
indeed occur this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the classic</font>

129
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,010
money slides that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have</font>

130
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,400
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> lead out the attack peak</font>

131
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:42,280
attack sizes down reported from 100 to

132
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,530
60 gigabits per second first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

it's down so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of fastening</font>

for us and this is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> burnout</font>

139
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,390
the past year large largest report and

140
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:04,870
the survey were 60 gigs largest measured

141
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:08,590
is about 65 70 gigs in on par with that

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't quite know why they're down we</font>

thought that you guys might find

decent number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of large heavy attacks</font>

very fascinating distribution in this

209
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,459

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,550
of about 1.1 gigs per se yeah but

217

and post floods are generally sort of

what we generally see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> resuming</font>

233

dominant in terms of number of attacks

these are of course supported by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

237
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,610
they reveal the source IP address so if

broken out and adopted into various

288
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,630
dial tones we look at v6 four percent of

289
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,150
respondents talked about finally seeing

290
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,400
ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos attacks seventy-four percent</font>

291
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,720
said no and some staggering number of

292
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty one percent today we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

293
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,790
for sure so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a matter of sort of</font>

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">visibility as well as sort of defining</font>

295
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,140
the problem right so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not seeing a</font>

296
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,880
tremendous amount of v6 adopter for

297
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,160
critical services we are seeing a v6

298
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">rollout obviously as you guys know or no</font>

299
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,910
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing even v6 dated and see it</font>

300
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,439
necessarily large bump in traffic and v6

301
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,170
last year we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is what 2012</font>

302
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">offering but again we are seeing v62 now</font>

303
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,709
shorts attacks finally make their

304
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,030
appearance in the wild what's

305
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,640
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as being a</font>

306
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of time looking for v6 specific</font>

307
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,470
tools into the attack space and I found

308
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">very very few of them and none of them</font>

309
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,320
really in the wild we're certainly seen

310
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,270
a couple of them they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proof of</font>

311
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,120
concepts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kinds of v6 attacks you</font>

312
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:01,100
could commit but not not seeing a whole

313
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,740
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of effort being put into throwing</font>

314
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,420
them into botnets here on our hypothesis

315
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,790
again is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

316
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,110
whole lotta v6 to strike in terms of

317
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,079
mission-critical services not a whole

318
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,860
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 connectivity and therefore v6</font>

319
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,860
is not a terribly

320
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:20,670
easy a target for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys to hit just</font>

321
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,319
in terms of accessibility but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms</font>

322
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,479
of the attack surface we think it's

323
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:26,250
largely<font color="#CCCCCC"> wide-open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lot of v6</font>

324
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,089
security services and knowledge out

325
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:32,490
there we look at another aspect here

326
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,569
again out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the survey this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where I</font>

327
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,220
spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of my time is in the</font>

328
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:37,920
operational security community so I know

329
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,329
a bunch of you in the room through these

330
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,550
kinds of communities as opposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> nano</font>

331
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:44,699
community so these are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like NSB</font>

332
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,139
sac and other things where a lot of

333
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,899
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically get done in a day to</font>

334
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,819
day basis so we're seeing fewer than

335
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,980
half participants are other half the

336
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:54,810
respondents in their survey

337
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,639
participating in this even though they

338
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,930
do a very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large majority of them</font>

339
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,370
eighty-seven percent say yeah we do

340
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,870
think that these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually very</font>

341
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:05,069
effective we get into some reasons why

342
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,589
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually participate some of</font>

343
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:09,240
it being concerned about tying

344
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,459
commitments or approval from their

345
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,949
bosses some of it being expressly denied

346
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:15,599
by company policy of participating and

347
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:18,540
discussing data there so we do see

348
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,610
people participating in their role but

349
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,569
certainly not with the official blessing

350
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,850
these are incredibly effective

351
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:27,300
communities and about getting things

352
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">done and like I said a place where I</font>

353
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,660
spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of my time and there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

354
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,819
of very dedicated very smart people in

355
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,699
this space working here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what</font>

356
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes him so effective attacks basically</font>

357
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:39,809
get taken care of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cases within</font>

358
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,870
an hour or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so very effective places to</font>

359
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:44,790
be if you're not involved and over half

360
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,040
people in the survey said that they're

361
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,769
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved if you are if your</font>

362
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,849
organization is that's great if you are

363
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,500
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved you know you should</font>

364
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,470
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get involved in one way</font>

365
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,559
or another but certainly do know that

366
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,410
you're welcome most communities as well

367
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:04,019
so with that I want to basically help

368
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,540
try to bring us back<font color="#CCCCCC"> into time here as</font>

369
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:09,689
we can get to lunch on time so we have a

370
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,980
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes left but summary here v6 is</font>

371
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:12,899
finally made an appearance of an

372
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,240
Allosaurus landscape first time that

373
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,399
we've seen this happen we are seeing

374
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,189
again the peak bandwidth is down<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

375
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,720
hundred gigs per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 60 or 70</font>

376
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:24,209
or 80 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of measurements</font>

377
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,860
60 reported we're seeing these HTTP

378
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,719
floods and these tools becoming wildly

379
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,680
popular he saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool break out a few</font>

380
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,890
slides ago

381
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,479
Loic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the like and finally again sort</font>

382
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,520
of for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most fascinating aspect</font>

383
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">its ideological motivations are now the</font>

384
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,910
most prevalent or perceived to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

385
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,529
most prevalent motivation for these

386
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,610
attacks again a tremendously growing

387
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,080
feeling out there that basically this is

388
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,790
a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform what's called a sit-in</font>

389
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:53,370
protest or sort of argue about

390
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:55,349
differences of opinion clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

391
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,540
still illegal clear they are significant

392
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,029
disruptive in some cases we know we saw

393
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,980
this in the past month<font color="#CCCCCC"> or so with for</font>

394
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">example the SOPA and PIPA legislation as</font>

395
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,420
well as the megaupload takedown

396
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,029
significant retaliation strikes against

397
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,709
US government and<font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement</font>

398
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:12,689
agencies in response to that so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

399
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,670
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a growing concern and</font>

400
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,160
significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down market and really</font>

401
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,390
affects a lot of people and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

402
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to say thanks don't take some</font>

403
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:24,300
questions John hi Jose jean-christophe

404
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,520
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> team camry thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for presentation</font>

405
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,719
so I one slide that would be interesting

406
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,060
to have if you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data maybe</font>

407
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,029
for next time for your survey is what

408
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:36,270
what is the response from providers to

409
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:37,470
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean some perhaps or let</font>

410
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,390
the packets fly because they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill</font>

411
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it maybe others you know is it up</font>

412
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,420
you know deal with up streams or filter

413
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,860
and so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting about</font>

414
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,360
how they actually respond to it I do

415
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,610
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data I didn't put the slide in</font>

416
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,370
here you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's largely</font>

417
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,930
unchanged<font color="#E5E5E5"> year to year in terms of it's</font>

418
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,830
very often basically black hole<font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

419
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,359
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very often employ ackles maybe take</font>

420
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,190
a client IP addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block</font>

421
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,650
those individually at the border

422
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,870
reaching out to others on occasion but

423
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,089
by and large the significant majority

424
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,550
are basically take that IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

425
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:13,919
drop that traffic at the border for the

426
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:17,159
duration of the attack yes Eric Z guest

427
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,230
is see here on quiet when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're we were</font>

428
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,449
talking about 100 gigabits and seeing a

429
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,980
drop when I looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that graph it kind</font>

430
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,290
of looked to me like more like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

431
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,710
mega 100 gigs was an anomaly and that

432
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,480
the generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trend is still upward</font>

433
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:32,280
it might be more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a</font>

434
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,620
more granular graph than that year by

435
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,210
quarter by month or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something just to</font>

436
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,489
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stand out where</font>

437
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,600
someone burned it burned it all you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

438
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,179
use it in news

439
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,100
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good idea well in fact</font>

440
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,380
one thing I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that I think your</font>

441
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,909
idea of breaking out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarter goes a</font>

442
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,179
long way to sort of determining if it

443
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,669
was indeed a bum<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way of looking</font>

444
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:57,809
at 100 gigs is the anomaly here as

445
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:59,370
opposed to 60 gig would be to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

446
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:01,410
the distributions look at City 95th

447
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,870
percentile and graph that instead of the

448
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,620
absolute max to see if that's much more

449
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:09,360
smooth I'll go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take that data</font>

450
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,520
and analyze it that way just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

451
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,899
determine if that is indeed what's going

452
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,510
on because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bit weird to me</font>

453
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:19,020
we've been hypothesizing and arguing

454
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,150
that basically the max is more or less

455
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,789
sort of the max transit commonly

456
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,340
available transit interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> size right</font>

457
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:29,669
so as you either bond tends to get to

458
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,570
40s or you try coupling 100 that you're

459
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:33,210
basically going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep filling those</font>

460
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,678
pipes is if you can at least once that

461
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,809
in that year<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that max for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the year</font>

462
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:40,700
and this sort of argues against that if

463
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:42,720
this is indeed a true a true drop right

464
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,820
this was just a thing else is going on

465
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,409
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else limiting that so</font>

466
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,850
it's worth I think digging in and that's

467
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:49,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to attack it</font>

468
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,840
and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what's going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

469
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:53,730
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you raise a good point that 2010</font>

470
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,000
might have been the anomaly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 2011</font>

471
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,130
yeah i'm gonna edward crab<font color="#E5E5E5"> google</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm an</font>

472
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,890
echoes point i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great date</font>

473
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,720
obviously always<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but they would be</font>

474
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">great to see box plots per year yeah</font>

475
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,840
basically box and whisker thank you yeah

476
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,840
thanks

477
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:20,629
I think I brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> us back on time for</font>

478
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:22,549
questions yeah so Heather<font color="#E5E5E5"> Schiller</font>

479
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,330
verizon kind of asking on behalf of a

480
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:29,539
colleague um your data is gathered from

481
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,129
your peak flow and TMS instant okay that

482
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have deployed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customers can you</font>

483
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:39,010
also estimate the volume of traffic that

484
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:41,240
the volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good traffic that is</font>

485
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,610
compared against the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DOS attack</font>

486
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic so if you have a tengo DOS</font>

487
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack and what the sort of what the</font>

488
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:52,580
volume of good traffic that's that's in

489
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,500
there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we do have that data it</font>

490
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,500
is come up on the XML words that get

491
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,419
sent up it's not processed in real time

492
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,240
so I have to basically go back and mine

493
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:04,370
the archives which are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less and</font>

494
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,020
complete to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that determination</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

495
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:10,399
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fascinating idea and something I</font>

496
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:12,168
should probably automate what it comes

497
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
down to it again the data is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

498
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,440
would take<font color="#E5E5E5"> some effort I think to sort</font>

499
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,580
of not a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code but you know</font>

500
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,049
pilot ln2 code to make it stand out I

501
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,820
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it handy though where it</font>

502
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:27,440
comes down to hey erik oster<font color="#CCCCCC"> / hey loves</font>

503
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">i really like the presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

504
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,600
had one quick clarifying question on

505
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,580
slide 12 I didn't quite understand the

506
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,350
scale look like the percentages didn't

507
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,030
add up so i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to understand</font>

508
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,530
like seventy two percent thirty-seven

509
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,418
percent like what were the percentages

510
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,250
of ah so it's basically which of the

511
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,950
following have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you seen in the past you</font>

512
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:49,130
know year not not necessarily pick one

513
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:54,340
but you know check all that apply so

514
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,340
it's percent respondents not so yeah

515
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,840
thanks

516
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright thanks a lot everyone if I</font>

517
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned yet there is a survey</font>

518
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,480
out there on the web page<font color="#CCCCCC"> softlayer has</font>

519
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,750
donated some fantastic prizes way<font color="#E5E5E5"> coms</font>

520
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,250
Kendall's digital frames oh my we'll be

521
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">back here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at two-thirty for another set</font>

522
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,960
of lightning talks and great talk by

523
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,700
Renesys about a mysterious incident on

524

the internet from last<font color="#E5E5E5"> November thanks a</font>
