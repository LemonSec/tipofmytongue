1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,549
so today I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present pinging in</font>

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,189
the rain preliminary measurements study

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,200
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how weather affects</font>

4
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:12,809
residential internet connections and

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,280
this is a bit different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than many of the</font>

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,410
other outage studies that are out there

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,509
the one that was presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday for</font>

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,880
example we're not focusing on

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,920
large-scale outages instead we're sort

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,500
of focusing on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> small-scale everyday</font>

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,890
outages the sort of routine many natural

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,439
disasters that happen every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day and also</font>

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">we know that providers track this</font>

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,620
information how weather affects their

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,280
networks but we're looking globally

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,680
we're looking across providers so there

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">are three steps in that we use to figure</font>

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,090
out how weather affects the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,610
first we identify residential IPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,920
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> subject to weather and that means we</font>

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,239
basically track weather forecasts and

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,760
when there's a forecast for a particular

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,309
area we find IPS in that area and ping

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,660
them the next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> is paying them we</font>

25
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,669
paying that before the weather event

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,640
during it and after so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can see the</font>

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">host if it went down from up to down due</font>

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,590
to the weather event and finally we

29
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,260
analyze this data these pings are noisy

30
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,240
so we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out somehow we have</font>

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to identify if there's a failure in that</font>

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,140
noisy data so how do we aim our pings of

33
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,900
weather well the US National<font color="#E5E5E5"> Weather</font>

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,740
Service provides this lovely<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML feed of</font>

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,150
weather alerts and basically their

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,039
diverse set of alerts type out

37
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,060
thunderstorms fog all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,950
things and in this example you see this

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,070
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thunderstorm alert for a green bay</font>

40
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,500
wisconsin and there are two key fields

41
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,809
here this tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> us when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ping when the</font>

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,390
alert is<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective and we ping six hours</font>

43
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,759
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the alert and when it expires and</font>

44
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">also these geocodes which you see the</font>

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,490
bottom and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are called FIPS codes</font>

46
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,500
which are basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> County codes they</font>

47
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,839
identify the counties that are affected

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,060
now the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well how do we</font>

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
identify the IPS the residential eye

50
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,369
peas that are in these counties and to

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,770
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do a targeted reverse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

52
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,860
scan of all the residential providers in

53
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the US and the ones that match that look</font>

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,110
like they have customer strings<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

55
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,790
a number of dash and numbered as a

56
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:21,130
number we identified those as being

57
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,840
residential customers use max Mainz

58
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:26,079
database to find out where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and</font>

59
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we ping them okay so we have</font>

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the weather forecast we know which</font>

61
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,670
customers were going to ping how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,490
ping them so we use regular old ICMP

63
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,230
pings to observe failures but it's not

64
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough just to ping at a fixed interval</font>

65
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,880
from one vantage point we believe in

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to competently identify failures</font>

67
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,160
we have to ping for multiple vantage

68
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,440
points so first we need these multiple

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,540
vantage points we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 vantage points</font>

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,880
from planetlab that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> scattered all</font>

71
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,829
around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US second we're sending</font>

72
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,280
unsolicited probes to you guys so we got

73
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:03,370
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> friendly and we send so thus we</font>

74
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,980
send at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 minute intervals which one</font>

75
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,440
thing every 11 minutes from each vantage

76
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,230
point so far we haven't had an abuse

77
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,030
report which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got to hear and the</font>

78
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,679
third thing is we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage these</font>

79
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,959
limited ping resources we're paying

80
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,989
hundreds of thousands hundreds of

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,489
thousands of residential hosts so we

82
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,320
have to manage these resources we don't

83
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,020
have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> planetlab has limited</font>

84
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,910
bandwidth so if there's no response<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

85
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,560
a host within the first hour during a

86
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,410
weather alert we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay throw this out</font>

87
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,030
we'll just ping the other guys and if

88
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,040
finally occasionally pings are going to

89
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,030
be lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> for whatever transient network</font>

90
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,160
issues so we after a ping is lost we do

91
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,310
sort of a retry process immediately

92
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,930
after a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times to see if to see if</font>

93
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ping is due to a transient or that</font>

94
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,820
loss was transient or it's due to

95
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,080
something that's a much more serious

96
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,840
okay so let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data looks</font>

97
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,880
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a host that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> went down</font>

98
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,850
during a thunderstorm and on the y-axis

99
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,790
you see those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten vantage points and on</font>

100
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,920
the x-axis there is time and basically

101
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,109
you see that this host was up even

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">though there are a few dropped pings for</font>

103
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever reason and then it went down in</font>

104
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:16,719
the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then back up after the</font>

105
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:19,298
thunder storm had passed okay so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,680
this data for tons of hosts let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

107
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,599
get a sense and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also we have this</font>

108
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,620
weather data let's get a sense of what

109
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,080
all this looks like well

110
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,180
remember we only have weather forecasts

111
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,849
we need to know exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the weather</font>

112
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,760
was at a host while we were pinging it

113
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,410
so how do we do that well awesome in the

114
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,330
u.s.<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are tons of airport weather</font>

115
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,190
stations that are scattered<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over and</font>

116
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,580
also their standardized which is great

117
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:45,350
and they're a bunch of sensors on them

118
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use in the initial study</font>

119
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,150
we use the precipitation identification

120
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,849
sensor which tells you if it's snow or

121
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,469
rain and how dense that is it can also

122
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,330
there's also a lightning detection

123
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not shown here but it's</font>

124
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,020
an array of antennas scattered around

125
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the u.s. that they use to pinpoint</font>

126
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,070
lightning strikes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's see what</font>

127
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,690
the weather data looks like if you've

128
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,270
flown planes before you're probably

129
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,660
familiar with meter records and

130
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,820
basically about every<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour measurement</font>

131
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,940
is taken from all these sensors in this

132
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,000
example you see Flagstaff Arizona FLG k

133
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">fo g</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically the weather at this</font>

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Airport goes from clear to light</font>

135
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,200
thunderstorms too hazy cleared hazy

136
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,659
light thunderstorm heavy thunderstorm

137
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,180
this is the the data that we use we map

138
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,620
each ping to this data to say what was

139
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,000
the weather while we were pinging this

140
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,669
host<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's see what this data</font>

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,550
looks like during Hurricane<font color="#CCCCCC"> Irene we</font>

142
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:49,159
were probing from those eight or ten

143
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,400
vantage points and this is an animation

144
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,070
of what we saw the green<font color="#E5E5E5"> dots and red</font>

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,010
dots or hosts a green dot indicates up

146
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,320
red indicates<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and the Diamonds our</font>

147
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,690

148
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,060
is clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they're blue there's rain</font>

149
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,039
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> area and you can see that the</font>

150
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">storm is now moving up if you look in</font>

151
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area in particular the storm is</font>

152
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,410
moving up into the Maryland Virginia

153
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,970
area and as but like these blue diamonds

154
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:21,229
are showing up and as this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is happening</font>

155
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">hoster going down and at the point when</font>

156
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:27,650
this animation stops which is pretty

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,940
soon it turns out that our<font color="#E5E5E5"> host that was</font>

158
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,859
doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinging butch was based in</font>

159
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,960
Maryland lost power and I didn't realize

160
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,210
it was enough battery pack<font color="#CCCCCC"> out she's</font>

161
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunate so we had this blank</font>

162
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,989
amount of time

163
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,258
I restarted to see what would happen

164
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so let's look at some of the</font>

165
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,310
preliminary results<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this data we</font>

166
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">captured 66 days worth of these pings</font>

167
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,379
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus our analysis on a few</font>

168
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,629
providers that are across different

169
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:56,360
types of links are the real question for

170
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,699
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is is it this is there a similar</font>

171
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,319
failure rate across providers that might

172
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,180
indicate maybe there's just power

173
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,680
failures that's happening not something

174
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,810
like water seeping into coax but I that

175
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,449
also wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily tell us that</font>

176
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:16,190
but we want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it sort of across</font>

177
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:18,470
providers so the simple metric we use is

178
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,479
we add<font color="#CCCCCC"> up all the failures we've seen</font>

179
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,130
and we divided by the total time that

180
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,380
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking at IPS at that host</font>

181
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,030
very simple metric there are issues with

182
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,620
it but it should give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a general idea</font>

183
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:34,489
what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here's a graph of</font>

184
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,830
for those providers exactly what the

185
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,539
failure rate that we observed for the

186
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,810
different weather conditions across

187
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:44,389
these providers and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in clear</font>

188
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,150
conditions you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a failure generally</font>

189
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,530
once every thirty five days don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

190
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,719
what exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason is for that</font>

191
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,150
that's sort of a cross provider thing of

192
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,430
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit different for each</font>

193
00:07:52,150 --> 00:08:00,109
but that could be also due to dhcp

194
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,639
leases<font color="#CCCCCC"> experiments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear but we do</font>

195
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,069
see that in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems like in the</font>

196
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,750
in the thunderstorms and rain in general

197
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,759
the bars or higher so this this graph is

198
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,240
an entirely fair we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say</font>

199
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,469
this provider is any worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> than any</font>

200
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,419
other because there's a higher failure

201
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:16,099
if you're deploying in a area that's

202
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,039
really difficult has tough weather

203
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:21,710
conditions this graph doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

204
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,310
really useful so instead we normalize

205
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:28,190
each provider so we change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> y-axis</font>

206
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,289
and normalize the bars we're basically

207
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">now we're looking at the normalized</font>

208
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,779
failure rate for each provider and we

209
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:37,399
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in rain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

210
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,219
thunderstorms and rain in particular

211
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,770
first the failure rate in rain across

212
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,199
providers is two times the failure rate

213
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,480
in clear conditions there of course

214
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:49,490
exceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> there cops in particular and</font>

215
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,440
after some further investigation

216
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,510
the data that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four it</font>

217
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,730
seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're maintenance windows</font>

218
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to be going on where all the</font>

219
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,270
hosts are sort of going down around at

220
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:01,939
the same time no matter what whether

221
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,410
it's in of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to you</font>

222
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,680
guys to see if that's actually what's

223
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,569
happening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we have in</font>

224
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,579
thunderstorms it's about four times the

225
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,630
failure rate when the conditions are

226
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,940
clear so I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some questions for you</font>

227
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,149
this is preliminary data first of all

228
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,130
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys doing to measure the</font>

229
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:25,880
routine failures on your neck network

230
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,350
these routine of other failures so how

231
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,089
are you monitoring them how<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

232
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,800
monitoring them and also what failures

233
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,350
do you see I have this hypothesis that

234
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,490
water is seeping into wires is that

235
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,490
really happening anyway so that's all

236
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,490
questions

237
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jay Hanigan with impulse advanced</font>

238
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,270
communications in Santa Barbara yep

239
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">fortunately Santa Barbara has somewhat</font>

240
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:00,829
nicer weather than this most of the time

241
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:04,310
we find that wire water seeping into

242
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:07,880
wires is indeed a problem for us

243
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,650
particularly some of our legacy services

244
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,450
we kind of joke about oh it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

245
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:16,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a rainy day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> T one day today we don't</font>

246
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain a lot of that plant we rent the</font>

247
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:23,870
copper plant from verizon right so we

248
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,550
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have any direct correlation</font>

249
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,100
there and we're not really that heavily

250
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,930
into the residential market what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

251
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,300
seeing with most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these failures is</font>

252
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,939
they are power related right and so

253
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,520
we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of small medium</font>

254
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:44,030

255
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:47,000
business park or a fairly a moderate

256
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,800
part of the city and I can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how</font>

257
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,390
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of their UPS batteries</font>

258
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,910
lasts because we'll just see them

259
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,380
falling down like dominoes and then when

260
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,900
the power is restored they all come back

261
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:02,780
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time so I would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

262
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:05,930
it from our experience the majority of

where we get page that that a customer

295
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,830
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternate the kind of official branch</font>

296
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:54,260
there is a google<font color="#CCCCCC"> branch which they</font>

297
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,960
basically the rewrite of our sis and

vendor who built the home range because

301
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,620
they couldn't get it working enough with

304
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,130
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are tons of water private branch</font>

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,320
widely used and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows are</font>

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,570
actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it using clogger as</font>

311
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,200
a reference platform and they would love

312
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,940
to have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a more stable thing so</font>

313
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a quick overview basically that's</font>

314
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,130
where we hope to help out as<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

315
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,830
are having as a non-profit part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISE</font>

316
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:42,590
we hope that we can basically go and

317
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,620
improve the clog our by like helping

318
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:48,050
testing setting up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better test bed by</font>

319
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,880
like merging some of these branches back

320
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,300
together so we have a few less

321
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,920
ranges there and the future maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer</font>

322
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,510
support and other things but there's

323
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,000
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to talk about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

324
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,400
the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is we are not Clark adopt</font>

325
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,010
net the lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there to do an</font>

326
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,530
amazing job there obviously the resource

327
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:11,060
constrained to and we hope that we help

328
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:13,699
out them are not compete with them so

329
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,890
from the testing we started basically we

330
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,580
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite new the whole project started</font>

331
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,410
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> August last year the revenge through</font>

332
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:24,080
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of testing we do some compliance</font>

333
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,530
testing so we went through the RFC

334
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,110
compliance part we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Islands</font>

335
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,780
testing values for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colossus to see</font>

336
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,520
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens where are we missing</font>

337
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,530
checks that are like which may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be common</font>

338
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,050
issues for some of the crash is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy and</font>

339
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,630
we also started writing our own test

340
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,130
plans part of it for doing more combined

341
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,800
things things which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not covered by</font>

342
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,930
year of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're</font>

343
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested and difference to other</font>

344
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,640
places are used to work before we are

345
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,440
open source of other everything is

346
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,660
public and documented it's on our big

347
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,940
key you can read our test plans feel

348
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,740
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give us a input disease at</font>

349
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:05,390
things maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

350
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:09,080
being go ahead so quick status we mainly

351
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,370
tested today the 9920 branch we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

352
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,560
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of errors which we are now</font>

353
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:18,110
analyzing it in this Islands and also in

354
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,449
the RFC compliance we also tested the

355
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google is is code so far but that's</font>

356
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:28,640
based with two things which we serve are

357
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:30,860
tested interesting for the month of you

358
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,800
who are in more on the technical side

359
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,470
who part of you have like the job that

360
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,760
you have to test route us feel free to

361
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,590
talk to me it's kind of an interesting

362
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">fields that also have you extra</font>

363
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,780
challenges especially working open

364
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:47,240
source I mean there is one class example

365
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">da no real open source test suites that</font>

366
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">are like normally complete develop their</font>

367
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,450
own test plan some of them like

368
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">excellent test plans but they keep it</font>

369
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,920
confidential they don't hand it out I

370
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,990
would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if somebody of you is</font>

371
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,000
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share things it's like</font>

372
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,230
interesting to see body testing their on

373
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
how he tested

374
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,400
the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is those are many of</font>

375
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,320
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools are commercial tools which</font>

376
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,050
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> specially using open source</font>

377
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,060
community challenging because I want to

378
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able and I find an able to document</font>

379
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> being how is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like can</font>

380
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,569
you reproduce that issue so you can

381
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,520
verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> that patch and if you have a</font>

382
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,160
close to you can't give the whole world

383
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,460
that's too loud for access for verifying

384
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:32,030
it so if you have things develop their

385
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be very interesting we play out is</font>

386
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,920
kind of a nice thing I had decided

387
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,860
especially for bgp I want to do he play

388
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,860
like a year's worth of like maybe bgp

389
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,480
updates and see how he act the furnace

390
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,860
that is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice community out</font>

391
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,250
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripe does an excellent job</font>

392
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,740
collecting like bgp updates and tables

393
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,720
in a multi-format the problem is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

394
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,990
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be collected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

395
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Flocka itself so if i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

396
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,820
which are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> make holes important for</font>

397
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,280
Clark are clashing<font color="#CCCCCC"> laga they may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font>

398
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,680
not recording because recording device

399
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,839
actually had an issue so if any one of

400
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,180
you has a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection of bgp</font>

401
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:14,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">updates who is not recorded if clogger i</font>

402
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,100
would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

403
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,560
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also obviously limited</font>

404
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,569
resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can automate</font>

405
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,869
a lot of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have it well</font>

406
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:26,750
documented so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to see</font>

407
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:28,399
how we do things the clone things maybe

408
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,410
you want to use it for testing some

409
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,120
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> diff from the different open</font>

410
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,600
source project<font color="#E5E5E5"> or your own commercial</font>

411
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,459
routers go ahead as a our testing

412
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,070
information will be well documented all

413
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:46,040
online there on the development side as

414
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say the key thing is currently is be</font>

415
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,490
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different branches</font>

416
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,440
because all these about 10 different

417
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,840
branches out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> they take a lot of</font>

418
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,180
the resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the community we really</font>

419
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,490
hope they will use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to a fewer</font>

420
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,920
branches so we can coordinate the

421
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,140
testing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community there are a lot of</font>

422
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">people they usually built their own big</font>

423
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,330
features in there they try to submit it

424
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,040
back to the official coordinates but

425
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,310
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's like a few hundred</font>

426
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">lines or thousand lines most of the time</font>

427
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,428
the community never had time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> review</font>

428
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,979
it so it ended

429
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,600
up that he wasn't accepted and people

430
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,519
started their own private branch so

431
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,869
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it happened and we really</font>

432
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:27,049
hope that we can bring things back

433
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:29,149
together doubt we also do spending right

434
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:31,309
now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time on bucks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cup going</font>

435
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:34,369
through it analyzing all the different

436
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:35,869
issues and hope we can find like and fix

437
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:38,689
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bugs getting much more</font>

438
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:41,209
stable and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is obviously</font>

439
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,619
also like looking at different other

440
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">features and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font>

441
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:48,199
there to see things missing part which

442
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,179
you basically implemented yourself in a

443
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">row part or maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean in a working</font>

444
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:54,440
version and you're feeling back to read

445
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,759
stuff back that's like very interesting

446
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,980
person so my final slide just basically

447
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,440
keeping what I'm looking for hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

448
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,869
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear back if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're basically</font>

449
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,149
running Parker today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network or</font>

450
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:10,730
if you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you failed with</font>

451
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:12,739
some like recent version I would love to

452
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear like what was the main issue we</font>

453
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,799
know the big performance issue on bgp

454
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:20,748
but but if there are other big issues

455
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,059
maybe you tried it and you ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

456
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:25,460
major bucks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder why has</font>

457
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:27,019
nobody ever tested that please talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

458
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,999
me i would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that things</font>

459
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:32,629
like that gets tested and end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

460
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:34,279
test plan as also maybe you have your

461
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:37,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">own private branch which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know</font>

462
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:39,350
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet and maybe you don't want to</font>

463
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,840
compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue keep it at all private</font>

464
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,668
and you rather have it in an open range

465
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,189
donating their stuff back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your code</font>

466
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:48,470
out in an open source feeling and shape

467
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,139
of everyone and test it by much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

468
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:53,659
people and like evolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so please</font>

469
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:55,820
talk about about this tell me about it

470
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:58,039
so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure and the resident we</font>

471
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,019
can talk to you see how we can integrate

472
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,450
that thing to maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a simple</font>

473
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:04,309
feature you added yourself for your own

474
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,789
network monitoring something which you

475
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:10,249
think is really cool so let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> know at</font>

476
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:12,619
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs feel free as</font>

477
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:14,869
i say it's open source i try to document

478
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:18,080
about as fast as i can all the things

479
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:19,970
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> place plans to feel free the</font>

480
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,408
way they give us feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like</font>

481
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,299
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit at</font>

482
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:26,570
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be all them</font>

483
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:28,429
or send me an email<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you have a</font>

484
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,418
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit time for some questions if</font>

485
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:31,419
somebody has<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

486
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,650
john kemp for<font color="#E5E5E5"> reviews I'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> curious</font>

487
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it seems like about a year ago</font>

488
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:52,750
Dennis of sienko started a release

489
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:55,800
engineering branch and it almost seemed

490
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,300
like that was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the place that</font>

491
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,970
further quagga development really

492
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,909
started to come together and I wondered

493
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,790
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to him or you guys had any</font>

494
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:10,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussions on whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not people</font>

495
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,649
would head this way or go that way are

496
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,090
you talking about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keynesian game</font>

497
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:17,740
behind bitch Dennis did<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah so</font>

498
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,379
there is something he tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I</font>

499
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he does quite a good job the part</font>

500
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,690
is like he's obviously time limited to

501
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:28,630
and the main issue behalf we have a few

502
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendors were posters like my otha and</font>

503
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google and other things they have huge</font>

504
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,379
changes in there and they have a hard

505
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,090
time to get that back in I mean I can

506
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,190
understand him he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna like it</font>

507
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,860
all the changes back in especially if he

508
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,060
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to review it and</font>

509
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,280
that's basically the challenge a bit

510
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,530
less an example Google they basically

511
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete the remote is is but that's</font>

512
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,240
thousands of lines and nobody seems to

513
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,730
have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to review it so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

514
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">how much he may be willing do in the</font>

515
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,970
future to go together there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see how</font>

516
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,909
we can help each other it's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

517
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:07,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">down I mean I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem as competition</font>

518
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:11,460
I have quite good document communication

519
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,460
with him at this time John

520
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:22,399
Jared much new start so we had gone and

521
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:25,430
made a minor just simple change to one

522
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,080
of our quagga instances to sort of adapt

523
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,210
some of the file permission handling to

524
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,699
whatnot of all the update and mrt files

525
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,690
their output to make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> more usable is</font>

526
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,240
that something we can contribute

527
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,610
upstream sure if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the useful</font>

528
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,470
change please send me an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

529
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:44,229
love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like look at it and see what it</font>

530
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,230
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks</font>

531
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,690
Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Martin next</font>

532
00:22:53,590 --> 00:23:00,230
next up is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grundman</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you hey</font>

533
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,510
Ron excellent while we wait for Chris to

534
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:06,020
come please check that your phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

535
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:09,879
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC sour mute or silence so we're</font>

536
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">not interrupting people here thank you</font>

537
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,650
also saturnine I'm gonna talk to you

538
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,450
about CGN logging it is a horror story

539
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,720
but lucky for you it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a happy</font>

540
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,280
ending so first I'm gonna give<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a</font>

541
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,010
little bit of background on why I'd want

542
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about logging of a carrier-grade</font>

543
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,030
NAT device and today you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just go to</font>

544
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,270
dhcp logs and figure out what subscriber

545
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:38,030
has what address and respond to abuse

546
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,920
reports or law enforcement reports of

547
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,720
whatever it might be once you put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CGN</font>

548
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,100
device in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to step</font>

549
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,060
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public address</font>

550
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,429
is going to show up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web server</font>

551
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,470
log that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be tracked back to the</font>

552
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,570
cgm log which then can point you to the

553
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,070
private address in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp log which</font>

554
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,210
can get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the subscriber so</font>

555
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,340
now you have to maintain these two logs

556
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,100
for whatever period you maintain logs

557
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,459
for in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to be able to respond to</font>

558
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,530
abuse complaints accurately in that

559
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,290
cable has been doing testing on CGN for

560
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,639
about two years now we've done fairly

561
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,800
extensive testing across a number of

562
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,260
applications a number of devices logging

563
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,840
is one piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that was somewhat</font>

564
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,250
surprising to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> genet oh she is here</font>

565
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,510
he's an intern with cable apps has done

566
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,160
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> the testings so if you want to know</font>

567
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,960
more about the other testing we've done

568
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,570
in the results we found find one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

569
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,270
in the halls and we can definitely have

570
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,919
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation but with logging</font>

571
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,970
specifically there's some highlights

572
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,500
here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to point out and</font>

573
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,630
actually I guess they're really low

574
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,920
lights there's some gaps right now in

575
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,940
what's being offered first of all pretty

576
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,030
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> every device on the market today</font>

577
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,310
only allows syslog for remote logging so

578
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,750
that's kind of limitation and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

579
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,090
on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the template for the logs</font>

580
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,740
isn't configurable so you basically get

581
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,730
what you get this is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> facilities</font>

582
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,630
configurable so you can send it to

583
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,490
different servers and things like that

584
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,950
that's great but for most of the devices

585
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,570
you get these set data fields and you

586
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,220
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the format or what's</font>

587
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,470
included and so you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font>

588
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,200
size of your log messages which are

589
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,600
fairly large right so we've seen log

590
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
messages from 150 bytes up to over 500

591
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,399
bytes

592
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a single message and it varies so</font>

593
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:13,629
here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some dslite logs</font>

594
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,980
you can see the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

595
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,019
basically enormous compared to the only

596
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,100
one that comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> right after it nap over 4</font>

597
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,389
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same way you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the first</font>

598
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">one then the second one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is double the</font>

599
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:23,360
size the third one is triple the size of

600
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,370
the first one so you're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

601
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,080
varied log size messages and you're

602
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,969
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of them so we haven't</font>

603
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,529
found a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to nail down exactly how</font>

604
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,659
many connections the average subscriber

605
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,710
is using on a daily basis but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think</font>

606
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:35,090
we've got the order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of magnitude</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

607
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,190
and it's somewhere between thirty three

608
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,439
thousand and 216,000 connections per

609
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:42,500
subscriber per day so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiply</font>

610
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't add it multiply it by 150</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

611
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to 450 bytes per connection you come out</font>

612
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:49,899
with somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and 100</font>

613
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,009
megabytes per user per day of log data

614
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:54,379
which means we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about over a</font>

615
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:56,509
petabyte of data per million subscribers

616
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:59,928
per month right its massive amounts of

617
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:01,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">data and possibly worse than that if you</font>

618
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,710
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cgm device it's may be</font>

619
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,360
supporting 50,000 subscribers you're

620
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,490
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about over 20 megabits per</font>

621
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,490
second of log data<font color="#E5E5E5"> just coming off the</font>

622
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,679
device just for logging so obviously we

623
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,940
have a problem here this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

624
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:15,559
sustainable<font color="#CCCCCC"> model it's not going to work</font>

625
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,960
you cannot do per connection logging on

626
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,240
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> C gns if you have any kind of size</font>

627
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,610
in your network luckily there's some

628
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,960
options so today fairly widely

629
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,689
implemented by pretty much every CGN

630
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,649
vendor is port block reservations they

631
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,929
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different things but</font>

632
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:31,668
basically when subscriber comes to the

633
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:34,909
cgm for a port instead of getting one

634
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:36,980
port if the siegean reserves a block of

635
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:37,970
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe 100 forts and so now you've</font>

636
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,620
got this block of ports and the

637
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,659
subscriber can use you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know any of those</font>

638
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,129
ports the state has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be maintained but</font>

639
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:44,389
there's no additional log messages so

640
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:47,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have the one log message for</font>

641
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:48,740
the first block allocation and then they

642
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the ports within that so that</font>

643
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,690
reduces logging quite a bit you can also

644
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:55,519
do log compression which of course

645
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,529
lowers the size on the disk but it

646
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,179
doesn't really lower search time it

647
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:00,559
doesn't lower this though the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

648
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:04,370
data you're sending to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the syslog server</font>

649
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,049
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so but proposal that</font>

650
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:09,379
cable has come up with is deterministic

651
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:11,600
reservation right so it's documented in

652
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:13,879
draft donnelly behave deterministic<font color="#CCCCCC"> cgm</font>

653
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,549
right now in the ITF and you basically

654
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:18,139
take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside address range the</font>

655
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:19,700
outside address range and a compression

656
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:20,000
ratio and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by compression</font>

657
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,830
rate

658
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,600
is just how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

659
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,889
putting behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single IP address so</font>

660
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,120
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be you know maybe you want to</font>

661
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,080
put 100 subscribers behind one IP

662
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,399
address maybe you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put 10</font>

663
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,429
whatever that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's your</font>

664
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,950
compression ratio and so obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

665
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,950
compression ratio has to be greater than

666
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">or equal to your insight address the</font>

667
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,990
size of your inside address range / the

668
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,880
size of your outside address range the

669
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,470
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> is range / the compression ratio</font>

670
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,680
gives you the number of ports you have

671
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:51,230
per user and then you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> aside the</font>

672
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,170
well-known ports right so 0 through 1023

673
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:57,200
and we also set aside a dynamic overflow

674
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:58,280
range so then each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these ranges</font>

675
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,420
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of that so you take</font>

676
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,800
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of the bottom of the ports</font>

677
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,390
on the IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you've got these</font>

678
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,580
ranges in between and you break<font color="#E5E5E5"> those up</font>

679
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the ranges that are the size of</font>

680
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">ports per subscriber with you up</font>

681
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:11,750
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> and pre reserve those for</font>

682
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,610
subscribers so each subscriber basically

683
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,440
whatever address<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get out of the</font>

684
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,790
dhcp pool that correlates with a block

685
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,650
of ports that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're able to use on the</font>

686
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,700
outside address of the CGN and in that

687
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you don't have to do any logging</font>

688
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,820
because you can algorithmically

689
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,470
determine which users using which ports

690
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,060
at what time based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration</font>

691
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:30,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cgm device and the dhcp server</font>

692
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,810
then in that that dynamic overflow

693
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">ranges</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about I set aside so</font>

694
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,639
that if a user goes over this<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

695
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,130
ports they have in their range<font color="#CCCCCC"> design to</font>

696
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,590
them they can fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a dynamic</font>

697
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,340
port allocation based on block port and

698
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,290
that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have to do</font>

699
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,550
logging so because you still have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

700
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,350
maintain state on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cgm device it</font>

701
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,419
doesn't reduce any of that but the

702
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:54,320
remote logging is completely eliminated

703
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">or at least lower drastically the</font>

704
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,169
obvious limitation<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is the</font>

705
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,970
compression ratios have to be low if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

706

want to put 10,000 customers or a

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,780
thousand customers behind an IP address

708
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,370
this probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't work for you but if</font>

quite a bit so is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what it looks</font>

like you can see we've got your

subscribers on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand side there</font>

714
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,310
that are getting DHCP addresses and

715
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,710
those addresses again correlate to the

716
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:24,350
pools of ports so for pool one goes to

717
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,390
address one and there could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be multiple</font>

718
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,469
ways to do this algorithmically you

719
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,330
could spread the<font color="#CCCCCC"> port's across multiple</font>

720
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,440
IPS you could spread them out within one

721
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,389
IP or you could just have them in single

722
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,370
blocks depend on how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

723
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">gift ports to your users but basically</font>

724
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,550
the idea is that you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

725
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,350
configuration of the cgm device the

726
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:42,649
configuration of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dhp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device and you</font>

727
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:44,030
can algorithmically map below the the

728
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,830
mapping between the range<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

729
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,970
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then also we would recommend</font>

730
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if a vendor implements</font>

731
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,810
this they put away or you know something

732
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,430
in the command line to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

733
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">reverse it automatically right just ask</font>

734
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:56,570
it hey who had this port at this time it

735
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,550
can tell you and then of course if the

736
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,530
pool gets exhausted you dumped over to

737
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:03,530
the dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> pool where you do have to do</font>

738
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:05,870
logging and again at the top there's

739
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:08,450
this pool you could use for static port

740
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,280
reservations you may use that for for

741
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,840
control protocol for its maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

742
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,290
portal where<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers can dial up a</font>

743
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,929
static work they need whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

744
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:19,930
and that's basically it mrs. questions

745
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:34,779
Thanks excellent thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh one</font>

746
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:38,779
question hi this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a doctor from guavas</font>

747
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:41,830
we talked to a few providers and they

748
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:44,299
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their countries have put a</font>

749
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:46,249
restriction that you have to log<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

750
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:48,470
destination IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well as of some of the</font>

751
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:50,539
other parameters so essentially they

752
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,210
could not use they could not use

753
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:56,299
port-based allocation in their scenario

754
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,679
so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that happening which would</font>

755
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:59,809
prevent the use of this compression

756
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,070
technique potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

757
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,779
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

758
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,658
that prompted this there was a bill

759
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:07,369
going through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US it was trying to</font>

760
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:10,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">become a US law it was going to mandate</font>

761
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:13,070
something like 18 or 24 months of

762
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:14,928
customer user data luckily that bill has

763
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,269
died for the moment at least but in

764
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:19,039
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal was born</font>

765
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:20,330
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to demonstrate to the US</font>

766
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">government that you could do this</font>

767
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,970
without having the logs so you don't

768
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:24,409
need those petabytes and petabytes of

769
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,299
data you can have an algorithmic

770
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:28,909
approach so we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that having this</font>

771
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:32,200
technology available may reduce the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

772
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:32,200
for those kind
