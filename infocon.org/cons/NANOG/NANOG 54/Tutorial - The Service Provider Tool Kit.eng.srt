PowerPoint slides and it works quite

119
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:19,000
quite effectively with that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font>

120
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:23,109
ask questions with it and so will try to

works fine as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was asked to do yeah</font>

146

going to look like 2012 i think is a key

152
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,930
an inflection point<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to talk</font>

community talk about why you here is one

155
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,190
of the reasons why I think 2012 is going

156
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,590
to be what we look back 10 years from

157
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,120
now is a year where things start to turn

158

private industry here in this room at

162
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,370

wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that sort of</font>

collaboration today we're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

for doing criminal activities right and

232
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,900
it was an industry effort take it down

233
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,069
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of thing that's</font>

256
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,100
that the bad guy is using the skin

an hour there's some team<font color="#E5E5E5"> organized</font>

266
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">within private industry that investigate</font>

267
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,100
what's going on with it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it</font>

268
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:05,260
with encrypted wikis exchange schools

269
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,290
with information being shared that but

270
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,939
put people out and saying I didn't know

271
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,860
you guys share dis<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> details of</font>

272
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,810
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> of each other's what's going</font>

273
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,760
on with all these networks what does

274
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,109
have an impact with because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

275
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,060
allowing us to actually make big

276
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,280
differences and these big differences is

277
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,099
why i think that put this is going to be

278
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,689
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel under all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are part</font>

279
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,940
of this where you know there's a

280
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,500
disparity of the action because you know

281
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these different hours we're actually</font>

282
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:37,960
making success with is is a cork is

283
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:40,420
making the difference so one this

up and running that's tight and private

298
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:14,469
collaboration that works<font color="#CCCCCC"> right then if</font>

299
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,120
we need law enforcement say hey whoever

304
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,390
working with the public setting right

305
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this model is the model that's now</font>

306

you know really pushing out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in all parts</font>

308
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,870
what the work with it so so these

309
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:42,099
activities you know is you know really

310
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,870
making a big difference the technologies

311
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,760
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> session the one we</font>

312
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,730
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before this the ones we'll</font>

313
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,290
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here today I really pan out</font>

314
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,480
and maybe the difference other words

315
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,980
example those same to say I can't do

316
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,620
anything to protect my network we know

317
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,230
what to do is we text importance and it

318
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,510
not hard enough offensive I for instance

319
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">just before this we talking about remote</font>

321
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,540
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in first session how much do you</font>

322
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,070
think it costs to do remote for good

325
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,469
finger static routes on all my routers

326
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,520
okay how much did that cost you I

327
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,350
computer stomach laughs at all my vows

328
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,569
or hey there's no capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

329
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,400

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,480
techniques that we use to actually lock

quite well in helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prep the neck</font>

networks and prevent recurrent a full

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,570
we not have tools we have the tools for

sure it's been effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we clean it</font>

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:53,569
up then action so when you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

368
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,479
just let me protect my network but

369
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,100
actually do something beyond like work

370
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,710
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your peers pushed into the bower</font>

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,840
attack the network by taking down the

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,430
taqman hours like here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> here as a bug</font>

and then remove the button controller

375
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,090
from the net this sort of action

376
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,860
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes a big difference if</font>

377
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,270
somebody touches your networking and

378
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,960
attached to network attacks your

379
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,910
customers then um you know sitting there

380
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,860
and just responded to it you know those

381
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,199
days are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> aggravating and it</font>

382
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,060
makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more so with the guys like</font>

it hot guys like an honest you know if

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,850
they get bold with it affect the

388
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,980
collaboration I'll dive into this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

389
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,210
session on what the concept trusts and

groups like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with it but this is</font>

391
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:55,490
going to have a big impact with it and

392
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:58,700
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> um this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that thanks to</font>

393
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:01,610
microsoft is really pan and a prophetic

394
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,800
a very interesting way there's some all

395
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:07,940
of us a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago who said if</font>

396
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,670
somebody touches my network instead of

397
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,830
just loud them you know just of groaning

398
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,890
laughs it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that physically piece of</font>

399
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,380
malware um let's do something about it

400
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,780
not what the law enforcement agencies

401
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">book in the civil courts other words if</font>

404
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,750
something before and I can identify say

405
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,460
here's an asset so I say okay here's a

406

computer access this is the computer

407

assets being used for an hour right and

408
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,250
with that that malware and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

413
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:51,080
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just saying you know hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

thing going on with it so this sort of

458
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,590
civil action is Microsoft started this

459
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,559
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be trying to get</font>

470
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,700
around of the year when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start writing</font>

471
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,729
up the papers is here's how you can take

PGP and have full control of who you

473
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,710
talk to on to that so there's some

474

hosting provider sitting in some country

475
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,690

501
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,969
that this year in other words part of

502
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,220
this tutorial that were resuscitated

503
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,649
here with this section and further

504
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,019
session you could probably see if not

505
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:35,489
knit next now did an arrow app that will

506
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:37,049
have a session and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a regular narrow</font>

507
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,279
session here's how you acted to touch

508
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:40,019
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the filter techniques</font>

509
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,639
here's a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> configuration that</font>

510
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,619
different vendors here's how they work

511
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:45,570
it's a lot of how to do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

512
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another tool of your told kate</font>

513
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,899
and say here's a service provider in

514
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Turkey or Romania or Vietnam</font>

515
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,530
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are Colo you cover my bad guys</font>

516
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,840
and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them anymore</font>

517
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,730
and you can filter that's going to cause

518
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,139
a monkey wrench with bad guys so in

519
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,270
other words all these things add up

520
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:05,230
where we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through and push against</font>

521

<font color="#E5E5E5">it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time forensics data sharing</font>

523
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:15,590
where we're able to take like the DNS

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,790
changer<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you'll hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in a</font>

525
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,149
couple of sections of speaking of

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:22,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">lightning clock that we were able to go</font>

527
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">through and take over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

528
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrote digital dns servers and put our</font>

529
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,660
servers there so we put clean di servers

530
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:32,300
and instead of the filters and have the

531
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,010
actual list of here's who's like

532
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,220
infected as they're all coming for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

533
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:39,920
dns service and eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out in other</font>

534
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,300
words it comes in from the particular in

535
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,970
this case it wasn't a sinkhole was

536
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming into from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns servers into a</font>

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,449
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feed went in there it was</font>

541
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,060
flooded out in other words we've figured

542
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,370
out how to actually here with each other

543
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,500
with security data sets where we're

544
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,169
pairing each other with passive DNS data

545
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,620
sets and now where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have sex right</font>

546
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,300
and basically i'll share this

547
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,070
information so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a collective</font>

548
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,230
vision a collective view of what's

549
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,169
happened to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy's all right because</font>

550
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you have a view of the bad guys go to</font>

551
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">give that guy's good a feeling bad guys</font>

552
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,150
subscribe meta data set we all put it

553
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,920
together where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

554
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,690
doesn't appear with each other now all

555
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,910
three you have a better idea with the

556
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,770
bad guy he's doing and we got it have an

557
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,820
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the bad guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing and we</font>

558
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,670
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and do something about</font>

559
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,110
whether it's you know filtering them

560
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">stopping them pulling out their</font>

561
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,969
infrastructure or in lunch case is

562
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,650
putting handcuffs on working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with law</font>

563
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,920

what we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this this year is</font>

705
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,020
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probably be one of the</font>

706
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:21,050
watershed here's where we're turning

707
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,550
things around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns changer is</font>

708
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,800
probably one of those core things with

709
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:29,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so how many people here at birdie has</font>

710
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:31,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">changer and what it is ok this is this</font>

711
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,000
is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird be able technical</font>

712
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:38,000
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns anger this was a criminal</font>

713
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,550
gang that basically rogue digital with a

714
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">cold in Estonia they're credible</font>

715
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,560
operetta is to get an hour on to a

716
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer and set and they take a poll of</font>

717
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:51,230
there being a so it'll instead of out of

718
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:53,300
the customer what an<font color="#CCCCCC"> end user go to the</font>

719
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,520
regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider dns servers and</font>

720
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,290
went to their dns service so then when

721
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,090
they go out there and somebody browses

722
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,280
and build like the Amazon they would do

723
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,980
added<font color="#E5E5E5"> searchings and basically your sets</font>

724
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,700
up a man in the bill and then but you

725
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,980
know criminal abs

726
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,870
yes was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS changer with it was</font>

727
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,760
that the one that caused the department

728
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,889
justice to send out that public desired

729
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,230
emailed and made no sense yes that's the

730
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,780
one checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a bigger there</font>

731
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,490
somebody FBI empty eyes wide with<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

732
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the one in our discussion it was</font>

733
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:27,260
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the victim notification a lot</font>

734
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:31,909
of damn<font color="#E5E5E5"> that used that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he used the wrong</font>

735
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:34,100
data set<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because what they use is a</font>

736
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,110
use a wiretap that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did off of the</font>

737
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,060
weekend when they got the vm<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

738
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,979
entire Colo<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus just what was going</font>

739
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:44,629
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> for gas son and so they were sending</font>

740
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">letters out for some food FBI you think</font>

741
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,730
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a mistake and alerted them</font>

742
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:52,930
right but it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big industry</font>

743
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:55,280
collaboration allow this to happen so so

744
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,630
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be more like that we're</font>

745
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,700
having scoop sticks up and picked up to

746
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:03,920
keep thing with that one is that coal is

747
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:05,450
shut down and the people are all right

748
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,710
and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prosecuted when you</font>

749
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,020
move over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here United States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

750
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,820
prosecuting United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

751
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,320
we're able to actually trace things back

752
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">down whether you thought about how do we</font>

753
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,340
do international criminal prosecution

754
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:19,900
we're learning how to do international

755
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:22,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">cut off prosecution so while that rope</font>

756
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,960
digital the domain change or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FBI</font>

757
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,600
victim notification a lot of results

758
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,690
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out who saw the handcuffs some</font>

759
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,219
people will do prosecute right so this

760
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what an action part comes in we are</font>

761
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,690
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do this right but it</font>

762
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:42,730
starts here we're private industry so

763
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,730
let me pop up<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my next session here</font>

764
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,199
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do</font>

765
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,670
so we have so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> new people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font>

766
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,870
would be sorry for the guys who<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

767
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">period per second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to a quick</font>

768
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:18,179
run-through so put this in context or

769
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">pardieu sinkholes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so over time</font>

770
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">since the year 2001 the service for our</font>

771
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,450
community start eating together and says

772
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,330
we have to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to protect</font>

773
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,160
ourselves right certain techniques like

774
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,379
a pulpit of techniques approach so that

775
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,260
approach we use the protector backbones

776
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:37,230
is not the same as is one solution doing

777
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,610
is original<font color="#E5E5E5"> one solution and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ratings</font>

778
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,290
of backbones we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

779
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,689
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from cloud providers it</font>

780
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,760
thanks to service providers are

781
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,020
residential oriented to cell phone

782
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,879
providers we got a whole range of

783
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,430
network so no one cool is going to

784
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,400
protect everybody and we as engineers

785
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,410
have to do engineering we have to be

786
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,180
engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> our networks right so we take</font>

787
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,480
these cool kids we apply in southern

788
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:03,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineer network so these techniques and</font>

789
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,640
I'll walk through these right first

790
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,530
thing we got to do is preparation we got

791
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepare I network operations center</font>

792
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,370
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what you guys doing here</font>

793
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,980
right now is prepare right you can't

794
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:17,610
wait until you know party to English you

795
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,250
know hits the fan and then start

796
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,889
preparations<font color="#CCCCCC"> too late them right so plan</font>

797
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,780
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

798
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">amazed how how a little bit goes a long</font>

799
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:30,030
way so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first phase we talk</font>

800
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,710
about of the principles second thing is

801
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,230
the collaboration I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

802
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,500
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't they feel the dot on the</font>

803
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,850
majendie to know people this is probably

804
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,320
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful technique where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

805
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,050
get to know your peers and work with

806
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">your peers to be amazed how many times</font>

807
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:47,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">in interviews and say because a whole</font>

808
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,780
bunch of competitors got together on a

809
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,200
conference call and started<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font>

810
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:54,600
each other to say to that right really

811
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,100
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty cool to know though you</font>

812
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,350
know get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with your peers with it</font>

813
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,070
and then come up with tools with it to

814
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,530
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's you know private list</font>

815
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,060
after touch girls I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a you</font>

816
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,940
know you invest in your peer connections

817
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:12,300
right I'll come in and out come on the

818
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,580
right right your boss is saying well why

819
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,440
aren't I going why why should you go

820
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,389
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people your kind of you have</font>

821
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,799
been really arguing with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss they</font>

822
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:24,659
come here right hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up right you</font>

823
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,970
got to tell your bosses said if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

824
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,799
come here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't invest in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

825
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,179
peers and something can happen to

826
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,100
network and I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know the</font>

827
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:34,320
right people to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually keep our</font>

828
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:37,049
network up and running and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a</font>

829
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,299
two-seamer that's a true statement

830
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:42,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a lot a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of times that the</font>

831
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:43,830
tap it was to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vesting you gotta</font>

832
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,970
work on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own network that they</font>

833
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,760
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be network as one kind of</font>

834
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:50,490
protection and some of the techniques to

835
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,169
do this are not hard and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

836
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,230
complicated the example I gave the last

837
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:58,230
session was a tool that CN<font color="#CCCCCC"> used that the</font>

838
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:00,539
year 2000 which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DP why access list</font>

839
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,789
and put log files on it and you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

840
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">into syslog so then you take all my</font>

841
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:07,590
router devices law might switch devices

842
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:10,290
and I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VP yxs list so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

843
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:12,629
take a stand I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand and syslog</font>

844
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:14,909
and then what they did in two thousand

845
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:17,159
is they put it into mr TD and had a

846
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:19,649
graph so every day you got to see across

847
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network all the sands hitting their</font>

848
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,909
port right and they got a threshold

849
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">every day they have a threshold and then</font>

850
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:29,629
a month before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elections in two</font>

851
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,770
thousand it's spiked up really high

852
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,690
which told them that somebody's really

853
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,190
pay attention to my network maybe we

854
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,570
should prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're probably going to</font>

855
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it attached to the elections and</font>

856
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,800
they prepared they're able to keep the

857
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,270
network up and running CN n Pepa network

858
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,429
up and running because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they saw that</font>

859
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:48,418
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get attacked now what</font>

860
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:50,760
did they cost them EK y axis list this

861
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:54,719
long which we were doing anyways<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font>

scripting the syslog go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mrt gee Tony</font>

863
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,348

use the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> at our TV and producer</font>

865
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:04,530
graph right so some of the techniques we

866
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,570
use to protect ourselves are not

867
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:09,060
expensive techniques to do all right

868
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,040
same thing of edge protection and

869
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,130
protection is a core core principle

870
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,700
right an extra texture<font color="#CCCCCC"> manges right it</font>

871
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:20,130
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything from using a bgp to</font>

872
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,080
filter if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using up you know the</font>

873
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,460
hi Gigi separation you know there's a

874
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,250
reason why there's a lot of that comes

875
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,430
out there use highest I exes

876
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:33,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">II from a security standpoint because it</font>

877
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:36,080
is not ID right so yeah the upd which is

<font color="#E5E5E5">Nike and have I flights which is my IP</font>

879
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,650
and it's a way of actually keeping ships

880
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,270
in the night and keeping two protocols

884
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,680
what's that connection because you can

885
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:50,320
have a bunch of maps in your IDP which

886
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,730
it can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked from outside to</font>

where service<font color="#E5E5E5"> tighter security we think</font>

889
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,970
things a little bit different from just

890
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,590
like filters on the edge we do use

891
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,080
filter and is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edge but we can</font>

892
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:06,980
also use the protocols itself to protect

893
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,540
ourselves remote rig a black hole the

894
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">number one tool can we use to actually</font>

00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,680
protect the backbones out there listen

896
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,359
we got a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of new people here</font>

897
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,660
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people here have no charger</font>

899
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so some of you should be looking</font>

900
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the tape on the follow through with</font>

901
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,470
this but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a technique</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where I got</font>

902
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,799
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here my map I have a little trigger</font>

903
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:30,020
router and I get a attack going on in my

904
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and I'm going to go</font>

905
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,730
through and<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 vgp advertisement</font>

906
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,880
and then on the edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my network I</font>

907
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:41,060
felt the attack coming in so this allows

908
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,130
you to use bgp and actually drop an

909
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,259
attack bone towards a destination was on

910
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:48,020
my network so might have a customer

911
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,880
who's getting hit with a boss attack hey

912
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,820
that dogs attack is hogging a lot of

913
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,590
damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every word in my network</font>

914
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,240
instead of loud the package all spoken

915
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,550
for my head working for my download and

916
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,839
hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer I be used motor black</font>

917
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,970
hole and move that customers

918
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,280
advertisement in l0 off to the head

919
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:06,500
pineapple but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is lessened the</font>

920
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,690
intensity<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack by pushin of that the</font>

921
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still under attack but now my</font>

922
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:14,030
collateral damage is eliminating all

923
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,970
right now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cost me to do a</font>

924
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:19,160
static<font color="#CCCCCC"> rap on every router at friend</font>

925
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,990
around on a hinge it doesn't cost me a

926
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,049
lot to do so a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques</font>

927
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:26,600
again are not capital intensive because

928
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:29,390
we would create them in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

929
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,220
where you as engineers and we will work

930
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">with each other and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you wouldn't have</font>

931
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,319
money in your budget or

932
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,610
security but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how</font>

933
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,010
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever is in my network</font>

934
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,970
today to make an hour for secure and

935
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,550
that's where a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques</font>

936
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:43,839
came up this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next section I'm</font>

937
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,960
going to talk about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does sinkholes</font>

938
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,840
and seek holes I'll just get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

939
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,130
such an epicenter to get through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

940
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:55,110
another part of the principles is a

941
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:57,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">vigorous packet filtering he could be 38</font>

source addresses come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> GA network</font>

943
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,080
should belong to your customers nobody

944
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,279
else's right and there's a bunch of

945
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">different techniques that you would use</font>

946
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,180
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually filter so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just me</font>

948
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,169
there's also some spirit by and couple

949
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:14,080
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools out there that you can do</font>

prefixed over with a bunch of techniques

00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,650
you can use the baby to protect their

957
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,100
to do on your network today to help

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,110
wasn't actually explicit like it should

986
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,670
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know you can't stop this and</font>

987
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,819
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came</font>

988
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,829
assistance to stop it being<font color="#CCCCCC"> killed was</font>

989
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:48,049
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business necessity that</font>

990
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:50,420
product managers need to understand

991
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:53,900
what's happenin to customers had nothing

992
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:56,089
to do with security I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not been</font>

993
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,069
doing security but all your kind of look

994
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,569
at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for security reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but had</font>

995
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:02,390
nothing new for security that's not one

996
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:03,890
you know he was scared he came later so

997
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,210
here he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh wow hey we can use</font>

998
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,460
it for security but the reason was

999
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,530
stadium-sized this cisco reason why was

1000
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,750
integrated with was staff and the reason

1001
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:13,490
why we took it out to did the whole you

1002
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,990
know hoping sort with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> c</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code tables</font>

1003
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:20,149
and things like that and their partners

1004
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:22,879
was to keep it you know from us know

1005
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:25,160
what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a network right so</font>

1006
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,190
that was that was that's an example

1007
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,740
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> a visibility because it was not</font>

1008
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:32,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">just for security standpoint and then</font>

1009
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,129
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last sighting here and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1010
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:37,160
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll go through the day as is we</font>

1011
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:39,829
meeting violated customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright how</font>

1012
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,808
giving customers a time even if people

1013
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:43,880
will give you lots of reports soon and

1014
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:46,579
say hey this customer is infected

1015
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,190
violated right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we clean them up</font>

1016
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:50,750
and we got enough experience out there

1017
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:54,650
in the industry to know how to do proud

1018
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:56,960
of how to do that so let's now that's

1019
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:59,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the context on some of the sessions we</font>

1020
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:05,380
covered already before we dive into

1021
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:05,380
nicole's so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start what sinkholes</font>

1022
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:12,859
so zip colt is how many people have seen

1023
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:16,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">holes computer internet work a couple of</font>

1024

1026
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,250

1027
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,520
lab because this is a this is a super

1028
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:28,160
powerful<font color="#CCCCCC"> swiss army core</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> principle of it</font>

1029
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,410
see the Terms seat<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold paint pop it's</font>

1030
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,970
not a new concept the sinkhole is a

1031
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:39,799
modified shunt now how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1032
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:43,618
ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked on the cisco AGS router</font>

1033
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright for his fifth vacation Cisco a</font>

1034
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:49,049
GF spot<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus rather have this problem</font>

1035
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:51,779
with with HCL it didn't do HD Ellsbury

1036
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:53,400
and in certain scenarios that HCL's

1037
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,140
would actually knock the thing down the

1038
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,190
tube so we came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this old trick</font>

1039
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:02,220
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> at AU i remember a game</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TTYL right</font>

1040
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:04,200
if they keep an eye you I dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> go coax</font>

1041
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,089
connector we put a TK after honors

1042
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so you had a little ethernet</font>

1043
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:10,740
segment which is basically a TCAP for XP

1044
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,289
connector and you never static the mac

1045
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,990
to that so basically out an ethernet

1046
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:19,109
segment was always on and then you would

1047
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:21,359
for packets to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's a</font>

1048
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:25,200
chunk right so that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> shock</font>

1049
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:29,940
technique<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so so with that shunt</font>

1050
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:32,129
technique right in two thousand Code Red

1051
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,349
came out from 2001 with Code Red came

1052
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,359
out we were trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out how to</font>

1053
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:39,270
drop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we said let's take the shots</font>

1054
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:41,190
all right and on these conference halls

1055
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,720
with a bunch of service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

1056
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to configure sites and people's</font>

1057
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,009
understanding let's set up a segment of

1058
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,579
my network to do the same things or cold

1059
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:52,529
read data sucks right let's flush it

1060
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:54,270
down the toilet let's sink hole and

1061
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:56,430
that's what the term sinkhole came out

1062
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:58,170
it so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing more sinkholes is</font>

1063
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,569
taking a packet instead of trying to

1064
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:03,599
swap it or do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HDL will or and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1065
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:08,130
packet outside alright so that's the

1066
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">same cold concept right so a bunch of</font>

1067
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,329
these techniques black hole routers Tar

1068
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,460
Pits aunt Sonia that's all part of

1069
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:17,339
things you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> put inside it a snake</font>

1070
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,410
hole and the basics of this let me go

1071
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:22,200
through and safe here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sink hole now</font>

1072
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:25,500
seek whole network usually is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a limit</font>

1073
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch it just starts will be deep in</font>

1074
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,130
the switch and doesn't end odia powerful

1075
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,479
be the next or musically is even if

1076
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:33,599
switched at the spare ethernet switch

1077
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,910
connected to a spare port and you set up

1078
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,579
the matter but point a static knack to

1079
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:40,500
the ethernet switch so now you have

1080
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:43,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I can point to on ATM</font>

1081
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,750
interface right and so I can for packets

1082
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,460
down that ethernet switch now what

1083
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens when I for to pack it up the</font>

1084
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,250
units which

1085
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:56,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">no we're a cam is a very good device or</font>

1086
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:58,310
drop on tackling right clocks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1087
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,170
brain clocks it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right because</font>

1088
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,720
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack goes into a brain clock</font>

1089
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,340
at home package dropped a very

1090
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,740
lightweight tool for book dropping

1091
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:08,390
packets right so plug it that's where

1092
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,160
you started with a negative events which

1093
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,660
because it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to do so this</font>

1094
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,879
sinkhole network over here could

1095
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,580
basically be ethernet switch from a

1096
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,710
static map point up to it i can i can

1097
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,720
send things over that way so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be</font>

1098
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,790
here I got this attack so this attack is

1099
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,799
hitting this this particular customer so

1100
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:28,700
this host is<font color="#E5E5E5"> targeting so what I'm going</font>

1101
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,130
to do now is I advertise this instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1102
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:34,000
black hole instead of stopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

1103
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:36,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to advertise this it's a single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level</font>

1104
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,210
the package going to the single<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

1105
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:44,060
and then drop because the seat cold once

1106
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:49,100
the packets go in and drop it it's on an

1107
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:50,690
ethernet now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can span port now I can</font>

1108
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,970
put other things on a peg or look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1109
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">throwing out of the package so remove</font>

1110
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,870
turn your black hole what I would do on

1111
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:59,330
remote earned a black<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is drop it up</font>

1112
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:01,040
here by having no forensics I don't know

1113
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,470
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if they tap</font>

1114
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,500
went away or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because it's all drunk</font>

1115
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,540
over here but if I sinkhole it right so

1116
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">instead of having an attack drop here if</font>

1117
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,650
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had the attack drop in the</font>

1118
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:15,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">sinkhole I can see when they attack goes</font>

1119
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,780
away I can look at the source addresses

1120
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:22,430
I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the packet types is TCP</font>

1121
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:25,850
is higher see right on the porch for

1122
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:28,339
Kate other ports the same right by

1123
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:31,370
changing addresses the source address is

1124
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:34,460
boot or not smooth I can see all that

1125
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:36,560
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I drop them here I can't see</font>

1126
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,840
anything if I drop it in the sink hole I

1127
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,180
can have devices in there that can

1128
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,820
actually figure all this about<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

1129
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,470
so this is where this is exactly what we

1130
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,710
did with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Code Red to actually look with</font>

1131
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:51,109
it so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool having a sinkhole</font>

1132
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,390
in here but like for and/or into the

1133
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,070
sinkhole it gives me a nice little<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1134
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,140
friends is capability over there and

1135
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:58,790
minimize risk with it so in this case

1136
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:00,720
this is a diagram we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1137
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:03,060
the code for the sequel slander because

1138
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sickles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clamor where I go out there</font>

1139
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:08,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then in this case with slammer on</font>

1140
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,669
this worm what we do a slammer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you told</font>

1141
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:13,649
people on your sink hole hey advertise

1142
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:17,310
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> bowl down in dark IP space from</font>

1143
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:19,680
here now what's dark IP address space

1144
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,650
dark IP address space is the address

1145
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:26,368
space that has yet to be lit up on a

1146
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:29,250
network so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a / 19 from Aaron</font>

1147
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:32,430
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh neck / 19 you haven't turned</font>

1148
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:35,340
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that / 19 off now what do we do when</font>

1149
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">we take the / 19 on bgp and we advertise</font>

1150
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:41,240
a / 19 on these edge routers so usually

1151
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:45,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we do on these these are my peers I</font>

1152
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:49,379
take the / 19 and I put lock up reps on

1153
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:52,529
my edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i put the lock up route</font>

1154
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,380
on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge and then any packet that</font>

1155
00:46:52,530 --> 00:47:00,030
comes in goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to null 0 on my lock up</font>

1156
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:02,970
round I can't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right well instead</font>

1157
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:06,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> put my lock up on my edge I put my</font>

1158
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:08,609
lock up around here on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sink hole okay</font>

1159
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,160
and my lock up route instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointing</font>

1160
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">l0 I point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a static Mac on the</font>

1161
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:17,118
ethernet switch so now I met lock up

1162
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:22,170
route anything that's not late right

1163
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:24,930
like a worm comes into that / 19 and I

1164
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:28,530
can count it so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see all the</font>

1165
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:31,290
scans all the backscattered common

1166
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:33,089
enjoyed our car key states you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1167
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to network you just configure</font>

1168
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:41,160
your network to be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> tortola so what</font>

1169
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:42,540
did it cost you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this over here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1170
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,848
powder you're probably already having

1171
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,950
your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> i connected on a port to an</font>

1172
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:49,230
ethernet switch I'm ethernet switch i'll

1173
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:51,180
plug in spare servers on there I just

1174
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have my luck up on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my edge I put</font>

1175
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:57,270
my luck up about in the middle o in my

1176
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:59,790
network on a sinkhole what costume<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1177
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:02,640
knocked on my network in Tortall so i'm

1178
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:04,500
now using my dark IP address space to do

1179
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,319
the forensics about crystianna my

1180
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,849
network what is scan it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1181
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,470
looking for worms looking for

1182
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:13,140
now we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for activities like</font>

1183
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:15,419
that all right so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken what's</font>

1184
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,979
already there with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

1185
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why the sink sink hole with it so</font>

1186
00:48:16,979 --> 00:48:21,689
it's so we use this in comen then the

1187
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,799
words<font color="#E5E5E5"> backscatter the telescope sort of</font>

1188
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:27,690
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and enterprise networks we</font>

1189
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:29,970
tell we teach people inside a big

1190
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:32,220
enterprise networks couple of their

1191
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:35,069
private networks who walk around<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1192
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:38,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it advertises their default into a</font>

1193
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:40,440
single right then when people use for

1194
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:45,779
specifics but to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> people into their</font>

1195
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:48,239
right we scale this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

1196
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest in sort of technique 11 guy get</font>

1197
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">your story of this one guy so there's</font>

1198
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,118
one guys house conditionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

1199
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:59,430
provider and says<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey the other fighters</font>

1200
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">technica right this is it pretty penny</font>

1201
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:08,910
so geeky up he tries to nap the first

1202
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:13,618
sign on his lab and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Luis and he</font>

1203
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:15,989
advertises on 96 / 3 time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was of it</font>

years old<font color="#E5E5E5"> and was left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so he</font>

1207
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,719
configures it to see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

1208

<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it since I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure he'll be safe let</font>

1209
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:33,390
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure it and check with the</font>

1210
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:36,569
configuration hey Stan laughs it means

1211
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:40,589
over to use to OC 48 dropping connection

1212
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:42,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">once and he go like purchasing one like</font>

1213
00:49:40,589 --> 00:49:44,069
oh this is interest and you see where

1214
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technique</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ferry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> founded out the</font>

1215
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:49,229
singles for work but same thing was how

1216
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:51,509
come there's so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> 96</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / sweet traffic</font>

1217
00:49:49,229 --> 00:49:53,460
on my network 96 life sweet isn't every

1218
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:56,009
place on the network yet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got all</font>

1219
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,769
this destination 296 ice cream I never

1220
00:49:56,009 --> 00:50:01,769
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hell's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in my network</font>

1221
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:03,779
right surprise you know he was surprised

1222
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:05,939
with came by that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually some</font>

1223
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:07,680
customers and we're using 96 s3 to

1224
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,690
certain to use I successfully with

1225
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,509
sudden packet that means that they sort

1226
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:15,390
of issue defined with it he then goes to

1227
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,530
and get so excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this he then</font>

1228
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,770
eat it when

1229
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:21,510
and within a year deployed 25<font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast</font>

1230
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:24,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">sinkholes across his network going to</font>

1231
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:26,850
business arrived back on course until

1232
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,250
today he's venting geographically extra

1233
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:32,160
TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> pops across the United States</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 25g</font>

1234
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:35,720
sinkholes and address that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he uses</font>

1235
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:39,870
everywhere each one is a stain address

1236
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:42,899
for his single address and any casted in

1237
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:45,089
and what that allows him<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is to see</font>

1238
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,400
regional expression in other words you

1239
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:50,280
can see which which sinkhole does<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1240
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,810
right with it is it the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> forensics</font>

1241
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">tools everywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with it so it's pretty</font>

1242
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:57,960
interesting system with it so these

1243
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:59,880
things they've worked right deployed

1244
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,980
correctly you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put some</font>

1245
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,690
preparation in there with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them right you</font>

1246
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,310
can start it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one server like</font>

1247
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,610
this one guy you started we'll just one

1248
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:10,350
server but one server would and he just

1249
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:12,120
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr TG graphic with it that's</font>

1250
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,690
actually from this graph already started

1251
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:18,120
looking with it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use zebra</font>

1252
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:19,860
freebsd you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of tools</font>

1253
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,910
on it you can do tool number TG tools

1254
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:25,290
what most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is you take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router</font>

1255
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:27,720
how does our gateway to<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting smaller</font>

1256
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">router configuring units which in here</font>

1257
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,259
and then they may neither configure a

1258
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:33,180
fat bob static<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac or put a target</font>

1259
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,620
rather in there it all depends what sort

1260
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:37,799
of forensics in there it goes with it

1261
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:40,380

1262
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,850
right so you can start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

stand porch and look at the traffic

1264
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,660
going through there sometimes some of

these boxes start<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming honey next</font>

1266
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:50,970

1267
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:52,740
the dark IP address if you can look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1271
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:04,200
there oh when arbor networks was first

1272
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,760
working to get out into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market I</font>

1273
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,939
mean you see our borough a little place

1274
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,710
now with one murder was first<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1275
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,230
they were a menorah investment with

1276
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,730
Cisco I was working with them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

1277
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,710
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people respect to the head how do I</font>

1278
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:18,930
figure out what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a martyr</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1279
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:21,120
would teach people put in a sinkhole and

1280
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:24,299
so I have been configure a sinkhole and

1281
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,160
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Arbor up in here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1282
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,970
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we look for dark IP address</font>

1283
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,660
monitoring

1284
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:33,689
produced really nice price and that

1285
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:36,299
helped the engineer go to their

1286
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:38,580
management to say see this this is

1287
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and it just like for</font>

1288
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:45,750
instance a slammer in 2003<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco's IT</font>

1289

1290
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys an IT department I hadn't</font>

deploy sinkhole plug the<font color="#E5E5E5"> harbor man had</font>

1292
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:59,730
slammer right hit system like everybody

1293
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:01,799
else he ardor alarm went off I need a

1294
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:05,430
partner winning their<font color="#CCCCCC"> Slovak shut down</font>

1295
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:08,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> port's protected system right and</font>

1296
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,660
then he took the reports from<font color="#CCCCCC"> arbor and</font>

1297
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:11,970
something all the way to john chambers

1298
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:16,200
and so here's a reports and<font color="#CCCCCC"> done said</font>

1299
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:17,939
that's a pretty crap and IT department

1300
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,339
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay by a fire armor to play hard</font>

1301
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,440
with everywhere inside a better right so

1302
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:24,150
the pretty pictures a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of times are</font>

1303
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,590
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> important right so if you have</font>

1304
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:30,270
some cool and you're trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get your</font>

management to buy it off on it and you

1306
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:34,830
need data there's a free show but if you

1307
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,109
know how do you actually get data sets

1308
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:39,690
without the management you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

1309
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:41,010
catch 22 I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this cool but to</font>

1310
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,840
be able to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it in school works</font>

1313
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,410
my network unless they see what it can

1314
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,990
do to get this text 22 how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get this</font>

1315
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:53,879
new school on my network right sinkhole

1316
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,649
is it as a tool where you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1317
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">there and plug a new tool and has a</font>

1318
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:01,200
trial evaluation and you have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1319
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,820
data going<font color="#E5E5E5"> across here that has no risk</font>

1320
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,339
and packaging network so you can

1321
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,540
probably management to say OK Go it into

1322
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,060
the sinkhole there's no risk to my

1323
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:14,250
network then I can see what the tool to

1324
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:16,470
do right so so this is a nice nice tool

1325
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:20,160
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually from that particular</font>

1326
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:23,040
incident chart chart with it and with a

1328
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:32,160
traffic backscatter is basically traffic

1329
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:34,570
that if i attack your network with us in

1330
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,799
plus i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hitting for simple i'm using</font>

1335
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:54,890
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so if you're putting your</font>

1337
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:59,900
you're basically creative any telescope

1338
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:04,730
so you can see who maybe spoof in your

1339
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:07,250
address space and use that to attack

1340
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,960
somebody else because you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1341
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:11,210
indication to that standard a patient

1342
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,619
coming back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your network right so</font>

1343
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:15,140
you can able to monitor the spook

1344
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:18,380
apartment now if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear what</font>

1345
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:20,118
that means back in 2001 kada that is

1346
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:23,440
really interesting study where they did

1347
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:25,490
a back stand analysis on an entire / 8

1348
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,220
right so there's san diego state

1349
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:30,109
supercomputer center how 2 / 8 and they

1350
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,819
put the whole / AP turning into one of

1351

1353
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:39,080
the first and Orosco for some facts kind

1354
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:41,480
of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> will an interesting paper and</font>

1355
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,940
this technique is still applicable today

1356
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,890
I give you an example of where does came

1357
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,480
in this this it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this slide deck</font>

1358
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:50,680
but i'll put the slide wake up on the

1359
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:53,690
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> when commit see the dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kaminski</font>

1360
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:58,069
attack couple years ago oh my goodness

1361
00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:01,310
you can sleep in poison das right and um

1362
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:02,869
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I work I see now right so but</font>

1363
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,369
at the time i was at<font color="#CCCCCC"> jennifer's I like</font>

1364
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:07,550
waited something wrong cave we're

1365
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:11,470
missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece and because this is um</font>

1366
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:14,960
this looks to be very noisy and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1367
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:17,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">polity of mine who works up in Canada he</font>

1368
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:21,020
tried in his last his yaks beauty noisy

1369
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:24,320
because you got all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax tax because</font>

1370
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:27,950
I'm spooked in the authority<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other</font>

1371
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,869
words if I tried to spook<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISE right if I</font>

1372
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:32,060

1373
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:35,690
seen poison I see usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish attack</font>

1374
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:38,660
then I see my own network 1280 would get

1375
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:40,369
a hold of the backscatter traffic so all

1376
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,799
I needed to do to find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1377
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:44,540
somebody's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to poison some server</font>

1378
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,240
somewhere in the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> using Kaminski</font>

1379
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">time is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

1381
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:53,630
authoritative servers can watch for

1382
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:55,160
backstage right so the backscatter

1383
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:58,250
technique even though you know this is

1384
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,540
2001 it's still applicable today so the

1385
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,800
word that went out<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it can execute</font>

1386
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:03,710
act is anybody's really worried about

1387
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,780
convincing put a net flow in front of

1388
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:07,130
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> authoritative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the answers look for</font>

00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">people trying look we're back there</font>

1390
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,550

00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to turn to be used somewhere else that</font>

1394
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,359
means you got somebody attacking you now

1395
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,810
honey never puts that pack of somewhere

1396
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:23,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">else so that's up some of these</font>

1397
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:28,549
techniques they think they you know go

1398

<font color="#CCCCCC">they never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go away so monitor his food</font>

1399
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:36,590
traffic that's uh you know some some of

1400
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:39,050
the techniques with it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1401
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:40,520
a you know monitoring food ranges<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1402
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:44,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">flesh like tues there's a bunch out</font>

1403
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:46,880
there so this is doing the lock-up

1404
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:48,770
routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1405
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,730
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just how did the package drop</font>

1406
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:55,160
you set it over to a sinkhole right if

1407
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:59,090
it's going over to the backbone router

1408
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:01,819
so we're scattering so this is just more

1409
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:04,640
a bit more more applicability of using

1410
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:06,710
using of you know advertising dark IP

1411
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,810
address space out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it they're just</font>

1412
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:10,490
kind of covered that and then in any

1413
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:12,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">cast sinkholes is you know place them</font>

1414
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:14,569
all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place with the same IP</font>

1415
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:17,060
address and the idea there is that way

1416
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:19,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> back scatter traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> overcoming the</font>

1417
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,049
sinkhole would go to like if this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1418
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,130
one I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to sink hole it goes to</font>

1419
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,720
the closest ones so they have an

1420
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:25,070
essential point you have to go to the

1421
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,689
closer to 1 CC if there's a lot of

1422
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:29,720
traffic and that particular sinkhole

1423
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:32,000
then that's a gives you an indication of

1424
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:36,020
that that particular region of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1425
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,250
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is out there now this is</font>

1426
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:42,860
something that was used twice where

1427
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:44,990
network who have sinkhole configure was

1428
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,820
getting their backbone waste attack

1429
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:48,729
lowers what you're attacking was the

1430
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:54,620
point-to-point<font color="#E5E5E5"> place on the back room</font>

1431
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:56,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and so at the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was interest in</font>

1432
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:59,029
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical of matters that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

1433
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:02,990
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple Hal info on</font>

1434
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:05,510
lot of acs right so this was a few years

1435
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:08,600
ago where the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> currents were not</font>

1436
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:10,910
allowed good performance pcs so they

1437
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,350
were stuck in a catch-22 they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

1438
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:14,240
attacked on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back foot lengthen into</font>

1439
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:16,790
a CLS but didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough horsepower</font>

1440
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,890
to do that these seals so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1441
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:21,529
doing here you have these routing

1442
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:23,390
protocol down here right that would

1443
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:26,180
break so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was knocking down</font>

1444
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:28,940
the links with it right and the ACL is I

1445
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:31,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't get it in there right so they</font>

1446
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:35,330
had a sinkhole configured and so what we

1447
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:38,300
did is basically configured about

1448
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:42,290
advertisements here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

1449
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:45,380
advertise the routes here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and what</font>

1450
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:48,890
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do is if it's a locally</font>

1451
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:52,850
generated<font color="#CCCCCC"> ground here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll go over</font>

1452
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:55,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the link here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right if I'm going transit</font>

1453
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:57,680
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but if I'm coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside the</font>

1454
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:59,480

1455
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:03,020
destination of to duck tues might attack

1456
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,670
I would hit into the router my rib will

1457
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,470
prefer this rap down here and go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1458
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:08,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sinkholes versus actually going up</font>

1459
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:12,020
to those link over here so essentially i

1460
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:14,360
use the sink hole as a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hooked or</font>

1461
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:17,390
mechanism because the only thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1462
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:18,890
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worked over here where</font>

1463
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:21,170
these two addresses was a rapper about

1464
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:22,970
didn't this<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic over here coming in</font>

1465
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:24,950
I don't need that to go in only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font>

1466
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:32,529
need going to cross over here is as a

1467
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:32,529
shoulder last slide oops was the

1468
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:36,400
protocol traffic

1469
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:50,480
was this guy's it was paying both POF I

1470
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:54,190
sias grp these are ones that were

1471
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:56,270
necessary right here all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um</font>

1472
01:00:54,190 --> 01:01:00,350
transit traffic didn't need to actually

1473
01:00:56,270 --> 01:01:02,210
see those addresses right now they

1474
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,440
couldn't do one number dollars so it's

1475
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,730
one of those things in the middle in the

1476
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,080
middle of an attack you don't want to do

1477
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:07,840
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let me take my</font>

1478
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,640
point-to-point link and take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 100</font>

1479
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:12,080
that would solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem right well</font>

1480
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,279
these are some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that kind</font>

1481
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:17,630
of think through like horrified because

1482
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,640
somebody somebody max out your network

1483
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:20,930
this was a reaction to use at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1484
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">snake-hole as a reaction school but</font>

1485
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,649
something maps up your network and sees

1486
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:28,940
all these addresses in there they can

1487
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:30,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack it right so core high as edge</font>

1488
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:33,070
protection this is part of backbone

1489
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:35,480
protection is is thing to you know

1490
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:37,340
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer seagulls some people</font>

1491
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,930
say oh yeah let's lot of customers to

1492
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,790
see those addresses that even trace us

1493
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:41,930
that some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what what</font>

1494
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:47,050
information that that will give

1495
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:47,049
something to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spacecraft's for so</font>

1496
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:55,300
and that's our sinkholes any questions

1497
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:55,300
on signals

1498
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:04,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">i c-called atl we don't have a single</font>

1499
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:06,640
computer we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> business importantly</font>

1500
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:10,730
because we got values to once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy</font>

1501
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:14,569
audience and so we're going to take our

1502
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:17,180
honeymoon will plug into a usable right

1503
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:18,650
her beautiful so that's another thing

1504
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:20,118
nice thing about sinkholes is there's

1505
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:23,150
you know what does it cost to get a

1506
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:26,030
honey I closer you download you get

1507
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:29,030
extra certain right so again this is

1508
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:30,619
another example where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you're</font>

1509
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:33,260
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there buying a whole bunch</font>

1510
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:35,240
of a palpable equipment to act we do

1511
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,830
really significant changes to network

1512
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,859
that make your network more secure and

1513
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:42,020
see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with bad guys and</font>

1514
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:45,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bad guy operations right it's it's</font>

1515
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:49,880
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source spare equipment</font>

1516
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:51,560
configurations<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

1517
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,869
some of these configurations are you

1518
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:55,690
here are the silly<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration set you</font>

1519
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:58,130
know our things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pretty</font>

1520
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:59,570
reasonable for doing a rollout plan and

1521
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:00,920
get across your network not going to be

1522
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:02,810
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things where your bosses to</font>

1523
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,950
stay all that's insane now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1524
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,330
going to authorize you can figure that

1525
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">across our network these are pretty</font>

1526
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:15,590
rational sort of things that configure

1527
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:22,609
get across Tony network<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

1528
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:26,230
let's talk about remediation there is an

1529
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:28,460
inner draft out there called

1530
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:32,140
recommendations for remediation of box

1531
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:44,650
and iced tea networks it's an emboss all

1532
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:47,690
right he wanted co-authors so um

1533
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:50,300
basically what we had learned over the

1534
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:53,900
last since around 2005 there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1535
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">old big providers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who are around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1536
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,520
and some of the guys will talk to you

1537
01:03:55,340 --> 01:04:00,500
about it who have been doing meee in

1538
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,359
other words the mediation is where you

1539
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:04,640
know this the sky over here it gets

1540
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:07,078
infected you know either residential

1541
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:11,009

1543
01:04:11,009 --> 01:04:15,749
I let<font color="#E5E5E5"> him know somehow I helped him</font>

1544
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:18,718
advocating factory right and for years

Health Organization to say he's infected

1548
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:29,339
right he's actually quarantine him right

1549
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:31,950
and we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up certain tools with it</font>

1550
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:34,078
today over the last year we've been

1555
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,219
time right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's not the</font>

1556
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:46,289
one of those things where some guys

1557
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:48,329
install a malware on his system just to

1558
01:04:46,289 --> 01:04:50,489
play around with him and so on now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1559
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:53,039
to like steal his identity this feel his

1563
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:01,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the drug game moving into your</font>

1564
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,380
house back of our people so we treat him

1565
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:05,519
as not as a somebody's infected we're

1566
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:08,339
treating him as somebody who's been

1567
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,169
victimized and be<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated as somebody</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">who can victimize and we have a</font>

1569
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:14,849
responsibility to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something right so</font>

1570
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:16,529
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now in different</font>

1571
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:18,959
countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States is one of them</font>

1572
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:20,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the FCC is we're figuring out what</font>

1573
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:24,499
should we do it back home providers

1574
01:05:20,779 --> 01:05:28,019
that's cost-effective to help out our

1575
01:05:24,499 --> 01:05:30,749
customers working<font color="#E5E5E5"> a victimized right and</font>

1576
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:33,508
that's what we ve<font color="#CCCCCC"> asians all about this</font>

1577
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:35,609
is a collection of recommendations going

1578
01:05:33,509 --> 01:05:36,839
through and high EF on there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1579
01:05:35,609 --> 01:05:39,690
a presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of walks</font>

1580
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:41,130
through all that so first principle of

1581
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:42,839
this is your customers aren't the

1582
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:46,349
problem the customers are being

1583
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:48,930
victimized<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do this</font>

1584
01:05:46,349 --> 01:05:50,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and you think through this the</font>

1585
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:52,109
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

01:05:52,109 --> 01:05:56,190
this contacts is very loud<font color="#CCCCCC"> in us if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the custom report is going out</font>

1594
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:13,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the way we notify because we</font>

treat our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being victimized</font>

1596
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:19,560
and we're helping<font color="#CCCCCC"> a map and a customer</font>

1597
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:22,200
appreciate us comin right so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> general</font>

1598
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:24,270
consensus for people who start doing

1599
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:28,040
this is that the customers are

1600
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:30,480
positively responded to this right so um

1601
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:33,119
they're helping out with this the

1602
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,800
semantic data here's another data set

1603
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,090
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic study</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i highly</font>

1604
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,119
encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go look at this</font>

1605
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:41,070
report of the survey that did but their

1606
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:43,109
estimates are shown over a million

1607
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:49,050
around the world a million new victims a

1608
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:51,299
day ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to victims of it being</font>

1609
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:53,099
victims of people with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> dad where</font>

1610
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,560
attitude there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our activity</font>

1611
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:58,710
going out there right you know every

1612
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:01,049
minute 820 victims every minute you know

1613
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:02,700
14 victims every second right so the way

1614
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:05,640
to calculate down every day there are

1615
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:10,169
twice as many cyber crime victims as new

1616
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:11,940
baby born<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so there's a lot of</font>

1617
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:13,200
cybercrime going out there people being

1618
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,940
victimized so do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font>

1619
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,069
so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do with</font>

1620
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">remediation is they're trying here is</font>

1621
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:21,210
usually guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing now where a guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eek</font>

1622
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,650
really does create some our you<font color="#CCCCCC"> activate</font>

1623
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:24,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">said you did some replication get</font>

1624
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:26,790
something out there affected then<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

1625
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:29,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">victimized you somebody then then we</font>

1626
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:30,509
discover it and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroyed a guy to</font>

1627
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,190
the victimized this page<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the victim</font>

1628
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:34,050
is then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I discover it and then we work</font>

1629
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:36,570
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a raticate what we're trying to do</font>

1630
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:39,270
with remediation techniques is strut cut

1631
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:41,580
this whole thing where if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking</font>

1632
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:43,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">for we can discover it before the guys</font>

1633
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">who victimized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and notify them so before</font>

1634
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:47,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">the credit card stolen before the</font>

1635
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,368
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets used about malicious</font>

1636
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,770
activities go out there and start nom de

1637
01:07:50,369 --> 01:07:54,510
this is the hope and there are certain

1638
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:56,339
providers out there centrally length is

1639
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:58,740
one of them Centrelink is talked here at

1640
01:07:56,339 --> 01:08:01,380
the number and all thrown a security

1641
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:02,939
flaw and I don't know who sent you link

1642
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,859
here is here this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so they will tell</font>

1643
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:06,750
you your<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing it a quest</font>

1644
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:07,859
this question essentially they hear that

1645
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it for years will</font>

1646
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:11,880
actually walk you through their

1647
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:14,279
techniques how they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it and</font>

1648
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:17,009
and basically do the shortcut people

1649
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:18,960
they pull in all the forensics data see

1650
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,470
it and put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wall garden systems</font>

1651
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,410
and

1652
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:23,790
to be quite effectively to basically you

1653
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:26,220
know clean up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network they have</font>

1654
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:30,510
really pretty good clean athletes across

1655
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:33,420
the network right so another principle

1656
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:35,580
with it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can clean</font>

1657
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:37,640
us up so in other words people say all

1658
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:41,490
the service flutters should do all this

1659
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:44,070
you can't service providers all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in</font>

1660
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:46,920
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're back on providers we have a</font>

1661
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:50,309
role to play but we can't do it

1662
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:53,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">ourselves right in other words we have a</font>

1663
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:55,980
role to play but we can't solve the

1664
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:57,599
problem so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the service hours</font>

1665
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:59,609
to do all this and solve the problem

1666
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,980
service fires can't solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

1667
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:04,859
soon as promoters just one component of

1668
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:08,040
remediation ecosystem just one piece of

1669
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:11,130
the puzzle right a<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary piece a</font>

1670
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:13,050
piece set you know guidelines are going

1671
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:15,870
to say hey all you guys should do your

1672
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:17,760
role but operating systems got to do

1673
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:19,439
their bold and de- them do their role

1674
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,360
the customers going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do their role</font>

1675
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">energies the application guys got to do</font>

1676
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,210
their role everybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

1677
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:26,700
they've got a part to play and the

1678
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:29,130
search parties just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a piece of the</font>

1679
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:31,800
puzzle not a you know can't solve the

1686
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:48,960
with this is there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you can</font>

1687
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">guarantee you can eliminate your system</font>

in boot sector infection it's a good

1695
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:10,200
sector infection that there is no

1696
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:12,060
cleanup pool we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to clean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1697
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:15,050
full board so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a recommendation</font>

1698
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:18,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your systems not be an exchange run</font>

1702
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:30,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">should use the backup set before you</font>

01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:32,889
have impacted but I'm infected alright

1704
