actually an updated version from ripe in

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:48,300
November last year in was in Prague I

believe no it wasn't probably was in

it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be about Hillary on so</font>

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,280
that's me you have all the contact

the unit seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually no words about</font>

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,100
you need seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> few words about eyeball</font>

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,500
traffic engineering and then the problem

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we face here is the more specifics</font>

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,750
in it 7 i'm going to skip this as you're

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,839
not supposed to watch marketing slides

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:39,509
it's about peering we love peering don't

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:43,290
we we try usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> to appear away as much</font>

40
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,870
traffic as close as possible usually and

41
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:42,620
sometimes they fight against expensive

42
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,620
saturated links so these these measures

43
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,869
they take for for load balancing traffic

44
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,330
is sometimes a bit difficult and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

45
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,580
come compare these two networks content

they are contradicting so what do the

shorter money on the need of capacity is

52
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:22,950
growing and some links get saturated and

53
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:26,578
some are less saturated what they could

54
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:30,030
do is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> described in my slides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

55
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:33,510
gave on several locations I<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

56
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:37,820
several locations so you have to link

there you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look on that later</font>

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short summary on this lights</font>

59
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:48,150
prepending this is what networks usually

60
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:51,930
do they also do selective announcements

61
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:55,220
to to various suppliers on with the

62
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,600
drawback of course of less redundancy

63
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,609
they also could do community-based

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,040
traffic engineering they instruct their

65
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:05,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">transits</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are to prepend or not to</font>

66
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,429
announce to certain networks prefixes

67
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,130
this is tentatively the best way and

68
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,480
there is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very small link on this</font>

69
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:19,108
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can click of a collection of</font>

71
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,349
vendors

72
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:32,570
what they also do is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> announce more</font>

73
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:36,590
specifics and here starts the problem we

74
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:40,909
face a number of more specifics are

75
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:44,810
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if or acceptable if they</font>

76
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,270
use smartly and decently but what we

77
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:51,530
also face is massive the aggregation and

78
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:54,349
as a matter of fact here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font>

79
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,780
forty percent rubbish in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the global BGP</font>

80
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:01,400

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:03,619
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty percent these days so this is</font>

84
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:16,130
most of you likely know the side report

85
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,070
it shows how much smaller the global BGP

86
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:22,730
table could be if everybody would

87

110
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:54,920
selfish and don't aggregate neatly well

111
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,289
what what we could what we could put in

112
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,380
these slides now is a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than traffic engineering are the</font>

117
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,150
aggregation reasons we see is for

118
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,680
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all export communities</font>

119
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,780
simply not set people forget that or

120
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,800
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget to configure neighbor</font>

whatever are sent community they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no</font>

122
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:38,420
clue this happens yes what I also think

123
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,880
happens is that some people which sell

124
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,510
consulting actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> promote the</font>

125
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,510
aggregation

126
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:57,150
so what I suggest is please evangelize

127
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,340
aggregation aggregate yourselves

128
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,280
aggregate your customers talk to them

129
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:07,349
please aggregate if you can because

130
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:11,250
there is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason to the aggregate the</font>

131
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:16,169
/ 19 for examples into 32 /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 force</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

132
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:20,250
this is what we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right it damages</font>

133
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:24,180
the content networks why it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality</font>

134
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:27,900
and it won't vanish so we have to figure

135
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:32,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way how we can avoid it the</font>

136
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,228
aggregation we we will makes makes us

137
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning more specifics from transit</font>

138
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:41,459
because people tend to advertise various

139
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:43,919
and smaller prefix of more specifics to

140
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:48,000
to various networks to net various

141
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:51,060
transit suppliers and they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:58,940
often covered by less specific prefixes

143
00:08:51,060 --> 00:09:02,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">from pairings so the traffic engineering</font>

144
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:05,850
effort for<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfort of content networks</font>

145
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:11,420
is pretty much useless because whatever

146
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:14,760
we configure in in BGP regarding our

147
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,339
regardless of local prayer formats it

148
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,839

<font color="#CCCCCC">about several tens of thousand prefixes</font>

we could filter away so we cannot handle

this manually and once the prefix filter

holes difficult

181
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,389
what we also don't know is how the

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,268
routers behave when when we apply a

all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a black hole so</font>

196
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:22,060
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did some further research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we scripted</font>

00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:18,699
process them anymore in in script and so

212
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:22,620
we had to first figure out how we can be

213
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:28,420
processed the filtered filtered prefixes

214
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:31,240
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go with CLI shell with the</font>

219
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:45,170
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> dump then this to the piranhas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

220
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:47,270
demon and it's not the foreseen way of

221
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,010
feeding a piranha because piranha is

222
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:56,890
actually just a rail collector with a

223
00:13:49,010 --> 00:14:00,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">normal bgp session but it's the need of</font>

224
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:03,529
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transit supplier for a</font>

225
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,910
separate feed which actually would be

our our collector so we did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

228
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:20,689
figured that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually could save</font>

229
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:27,529
quite some traffic and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a graph</font>

230
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:31,610
from our ass flow data to one of the

231
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:34,820
major dear ones and we had when we apply

232
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:37,010
this filter list it dumped for about one

233
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">of me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I even more than one at one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> geek</font>

234
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:49,880
traffic to just one of the so-called

235
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:52,070
tier 1 carriers so we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

236
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,579
promising we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refine the</font>

237
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:59,149
script<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the prefix list became huge</font>

238
00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:03,890
so it was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than a</font>

239
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:09,890
couple of thousand lines and we applied

240
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:11,240
it to the router and it worked but after

241
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,640
doing this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't save the</font>

242
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,250
configuration anymore on the router

243
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:21,829
because obviously the memory is too

244
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:24,589
small and congregants took<font color="#CCCCCC"> ours not just</font>

245
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:27,649
minutes it took hours so the

246
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:31,730
consequences this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a viable way to</font>

247
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:35,300
go we cannot just apply prefix filters

248
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:37,750
and hope that everything would be would

249
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">be fine</font>

250
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:45,419
and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we decided not to publish</font>

251
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:50,309
the descript we we made it's actually

252
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:55,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">very alpha and we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

253
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:58,199
another solution so how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

254
00:15:55,309 --> 00:16:03,269
without overloading memory router

255
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:04,978
configuration CPU cycles and probably

256
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:07,889
the smartest way would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a new feature</font>

257
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:10,169
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not existing but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

258
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:12,689
have a feature which says basically

259
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:16,649
neighbor will ever suppress more

260
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:19,679
specific on just one neighbor and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

261
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:23,009
a global basis it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would allow us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill</font>

262
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:26,069
more specific from one feed and to keep

263
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:32,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">them from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another feed which would be</font>

264
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:35,699
pretty neat and so not sure whether this

265
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:39,289
is ever going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen but if the</font>

266
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:42,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">community supports is on a large scale</font>

267
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:48,149
probably the vendor would listen to us

268
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:51,659
how would the feature behave actually it

269
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:55,079
should be it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be enabled or</font>

270
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:59,519
disabled by her neighbor and of course

271
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:03,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">not enabled by default um it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should just</font>

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:13,010
quite an effort to to get this program

292
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:16,129
done another option would probably be a

293

<font color="#E5E5E5">large-scale prefix filtering along the</font>

a large scale on that the description is

299
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:41,480
in this link how you could filter along

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR boundaries the beach p table</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu cycles the disadvantage it</font>

on this concludes<font color="#E5E5E5"> my presentation of we</font>

311
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,160
have a number of a couple of minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

312
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,890
take questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy to discuss</font>

313
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:34,140
this also offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> or after the</font>

314
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:36,630
presentation in the brakes I really

315
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,910
wonder what<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you do would you</font>

316
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:45,350
support a new feature which would

317
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,350
suppress more specifics

318
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:54,430
yes please Randy potia raj um thanks for

319
00:19:51,130 --> 00:20:03,670
this president Freddie it's a constant

320
00:19:54,430 --> 00:20:06,970
help the a set of three step knobs like

321
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:12,100
this have been filed with cisco and

322
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:13,660
juniper for over five years um there are

323
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,120
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go</font>

324
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:22,780
down in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the details for instance in your</font>

325
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:25,870
next slide you will see where you say

326
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,930
dumps by less specific learn but from

327
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:31,179
the same or another neighbor if you

328
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:35,230
dumped it and then the neighbor

329
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:38,680
withdraws the next specific you lost it

330
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,810
yep so there are details that have to be

331
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,690
worked out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these have been filed</font>

332
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:48,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the vendors for well over five</font>

333
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,990
years hidden problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in the cost</font>

334
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,450
you're talking about when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you try to do</font>

335
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,310
with route filters effectively those

336
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,680
same costs are going to be paid in a

337
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,470
different way you're not going to have

338
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem loading the configuration</font>

339
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:06,100
but you are putting a compute load right

340
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:09,400
but but it's in the try so you know it's

341
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,770
down there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not so bad</font>

342
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,020
but it's still a load and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

343
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,730
complex yeah but probably these

344
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,830
engineers they are smarter than we are

345
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:22,630
we operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> us or to handle this issue</font>

346
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,149
but thanks yeah it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

347
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,160
we we have this filed already with the

348
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,530
vendors for five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we just bring</font>

349
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:34,300
the topic up again and it's like in

350
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:37,780
politics you have to talk a bit again

351
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:42,879
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again until you reach your goal yeah</font>

352
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:44,410
please jeff has juniper networks randy

353
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,260
has some very good points<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that once</font>

354
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,120
the prefix has gone away there's no

355
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,010
useful way to get it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we had</font>

356
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,969
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time or RF that</font>

357
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:56,700
says give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> back the more specifics</font>

358
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,950
that becomes very expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> the run</font>

359
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,460
effectively refreshing your box the

360
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:07,890
death if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font>

361
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't blame that one on me there's</font>

362
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,430
also I don't know if slides actually

363
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,340
covered because it came in the room

364
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:17,490
slightly late but one of the problems

365
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">with doing this type of suppression is</font>

366
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,720
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

367
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,129
that the AAS paths are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

368
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,990
much identical when you're doing this

369
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,430
oppression it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font>

370
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

371
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,110
years as address<font color="#CCCCCC"> space is being</font>

372
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,960
exhausted people are going to be taking

373
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,520
their you know / 16 for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tuned</font>

374
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,300
announced that for their reach ability

375
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,850
and then basically subletting access to

376
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,770
individual /<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-fours that doesn't</font>

377
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean that there's any guarantee of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

378
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:50,910
being global connectivity from that / 16

379
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:52,229
network to sublet space ya know so doing

380
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,750
that additional check up making sure

381
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paths are congruent with each</font>

382
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,680
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if we decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

383
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Refresh problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was solved would also</font>

384
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,910
have to be taken care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of yeah good point</font>

385
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,910
thank you and pretty darn close

386
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:23,899
did you woke up I<font color="#CCCCCC"> denied please okay</font>

387
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:29,119
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else so can you show a hand would</font>

388
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:34,399
you use such a feature if it would be

389
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:45,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">available please at least a few thank</font>

390
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:46,908
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you Thanks reading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next</font>

391
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:49,299
up we have David Applegate from AT&T
