5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,289
looking at and trying to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:28,230
you're doing with ipv6 it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,060
better percentage than usual usually in

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,830
the states like it about the third of

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,050
the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> of most to is rolling out</font>

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,050
or who's already rolled out these stuff

00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,550
you

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:38,179
a little closer you guys hear me fine

13
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,310
good so I'm Paul ebersman I work with

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Infoblox and my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full-time job is</font>

15
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,160
actually dealing with ipv6 teaching

16
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,600
speaking working with our engineering

17
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,550
department so I'm assuming that all of

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,289
you at this point are quite comfortable

19
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,590
with and it done quite a bit with ipv4

20
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,160
networks and the thrust of this is

21
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:04,130
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through what are the</font>

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,119
operational differences in v6 what kind

23
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,619
of things do you need to think about

24
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,889
what do you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in your network</font>

25
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:12,080
designs and plans to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with those</font>

26
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,820
differences so that you're using the

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,560
better parts of v6 and avoiding some of

28
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problems and hopefully avoiding some</font>

31
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,470
that we have is<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course what are you</font>

32
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,970
going to see when you start doing v6

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,910
obviously you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see insane</font>

all zeros or in all<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones address and so</font>

146
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,539
you picks it up you can be very

147
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,699
selective in what you actually listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

148
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:10,659
there's also no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> ARP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and reverse</font>

149
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:14,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">art what we have now is various types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

hey I've got this address is anybody

152
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,508
else using it and neighbor discovery so

153
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,900
you can find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else is on your</font>

156
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,440
is done as multicasts so only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,909
relevant parties who need to listen will

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,050
have to process that in their network

159
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:43,330
card there are three basic types of

160
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,979
addresses everything breaks down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ipv6</font>

161
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:53,050
to you have a type and a scope unicast

162
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:56,590
is one sender one receiver symmetric

163
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,870
communication multicast one sender can

164
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,560
send to multiple recipients who have all

165
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,719

<font color="#CCCCCC">anycast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is usually described as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font>

167
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:09,620
it really isn't any cast is exactly

168
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,690
same as it isn't before it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

169
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,410
routing trick where essentially you

170
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:19,130
inject the same host address the

171
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,259
equivalent of a / 32 a / 128 everywhere

172
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,659
and then routers pick whichever one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

173
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:29,720
topologically closest as the actual host

174
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:33,860
that gets the packet scopes say where

175
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,479
that address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is relevant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type say what</font>

177
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:43,399
one-to-one one-to-many scope says where

178
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,490
do i send it linked local is essentially

179
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,180
your local or broadcast domain global

180
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,730
unicast which is public address space

181
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,939
unique local which is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> or less</font>

182
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,010
analogous to RFC 1918 and we have

183
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,709
various transitional styles of addresses

184
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:03,709
that are used as we move from a

primarily v4 network to a primarily b6

186

has been deprecated there certain

there are certain reserved well-known

virtual wire it is a single VLAN it is

your even though there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no broadcast</font>

194
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,089
thinking of it as the broadcast domain

195
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,910
in the v4 sense is a perfectly logical a

196
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:34,959
dealing with it everybody in that domain

197
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:38,510
hears and sees all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those packets</font>

198
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:43,630
there is a special address reserved for

it epi 80 so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look and you do a</font>

205

communication locally including to your

206
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,459
local router when you send packets out

207
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,079
your default gateway you will have a

208
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,180
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> and destination address with your</font>

211
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,560
address of your router it's very similar

212
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,339
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing but linked local to</font>

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,840
if you are doing the HP

215
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,920
and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get anything and you come</font>

up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a null network you get in a pipa</font>

217

network the other thing that you will

218
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:34,150
find unusual is that your link local

219
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,310
address is usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fe 80 and then an</font>

220
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,800
address derived from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mac address</font>

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,420
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into that shortly but it</font>

222
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,420
means that effectively you are a multi

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,270
interface host you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same address</font>

224
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,959
on all of those interfaces there is a

225
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,699
zone or scope that is added to that link

226
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,380
local address so that you can specify

227
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,590
that particular one so you'll see

228
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:00,400
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Fe 80 colon colon a bunch</font>

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,980
unicast is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I expect most people to</font>

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,870
be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> for most things this is one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these six there's enough actually unique</font>

global unicast I believe in using it

242

everywhere and i'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

several times through here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not a big</font>

and instances and reasons why you may

247
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:53,560
have it mandated but if you can avoid it

248
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:56,050
you should unique local is that RFC 1918

249
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,229
equivalent and it has all of the same

features and problems that 1918 has it

251

253
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,630

254
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,219
is so large people will<font color="#CCCCCC"> say oh will</font>

255
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,100
statistically speaking the odds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

merger and acquisition is small to which

259
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,470
my response is human beings are lazy

260
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">every one of the world is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,140
one on the end of it and use it just

263
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:35,000
like everyone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world uses 192 168</font>

266
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,730
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if you're using</font>

resiliency of multiple routes and we can

specify it from the routers not from the

304
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:19,990
hosts so the networking group gets to

305
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:24,550
control how the clients use our network

306
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:27,890
it also has what i refer to as questions

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,329
that that particular prefix and address

312
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,980
is usable just like a dhcp lease so even

then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some reason I go back</font>

340
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:54,519
you do have something that goes over two

days yes the connection will drop but in

342
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,779
most cases they'll never notice so i can

343
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:02,890
have addresses coming and going all the

344
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:05,320
time on v6 and my clients will handle it

gracefully and the users on those host

346

machines will never know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their</font>

of the other things that is different

out that interface which one do I use

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,570
for my source address how do it no well

354
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:30,390
there is an RFC that has a whole series

355
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:32,800
of rules for saying this is how I know

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should read it in detail but what it</font>

357
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,519
tries to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do effectively is if I'm</font>

sending to another hoax unlink local I

359
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,290
will use my link local if I am sending

360
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,260
to something else within my own prefix

361
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,930
and I'm presumably within my company I

362
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,810
will use that address if I have

363
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:52,689
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a privacy address which</font>

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:05,839
rules for what source of

SI should use so subnetting one of the

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,579
really important things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

372
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,619
really and before is we have got an

00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:18,380
address space in dribs and drabs and

374
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:21,169
little chunks as we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

375

delegate so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance logically most</font>

382
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,990
of us can probably do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with dns we</font>

383
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,659
can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do subdomains and delegate</font>

386

business we can do it by hub we can do

it by<font color="#E5E5E5"> department by city whatever but we</font>

usually didn't have enough dress face to

389
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,090
match that well at this point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

390
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,050
enough address space that you can

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,699
actually have a plan not how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cope</font>

my network self-documenting to make my

know finally again we have some control

416
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,800
over our own destiny and think about how

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing your aggregations by sight</font>

one of the things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

430
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:50,100
to make your life saying is make sure

431
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of your prefixes are on nibble</font>

432
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,590
boundaries are divided by 4 because

433
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,480
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not dividing within one letter</font>

434
00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:00,209
technically works great but it's a lot

435
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,890
harder to view it it's the we are

436
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,860
actually going back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> convenience</font>

437
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:07,320
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> class full 8-bit addressing and v4</font>

438
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:10,979
without cider but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have enough space</font>

439
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,120
to actually do it and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

440
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,700
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say well four bits</font>

441
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,520
gets to be 16 bits so in this example I

442
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,200
do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> by my geography this might</font>

443
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">be something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a data center provider</font>

444
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,980
or a hosting provider might do so i'm

445
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,600
only in 12 cities so i can i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can fit</font>

446
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,250
into my 16 that gives me<font color="#CCCCCC"> four more</font>

447
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:35,520
cities to grow later on and so in my 32

448
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,550
which is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> two portet for chunks</font>

449
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,220
between colin's that's fixed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go</font>

450
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:44,100
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> my third one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first character</font>

451
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:48,630
that's a thirty-six that defines which

452
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:52,770
city i'm in i can then go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

453
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:55,440
second nibble in there and have hubs so

454
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,180
i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have multiple hubs or</font>

455
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,060
colocation facilities within one

456
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:06,180
geographic area<font color="#CCCCCC"> i discover that i need</font>

457
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,800
at least a hundred possible floors for

458
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,840
some of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> hubs because i have huge data</font>

459
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,690
centers so in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> i give two</font>

460
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,149
nipples or eight bits and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am now able</font>

461
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:18,710
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with at least 256 floors for</font>

462
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:21,420
every one of my hubs and then again i

463
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,370
have a large switching fabric even

464
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,900
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have big switches so i've</font>

465
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,790
decided i'm going to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight bits or</font>

466
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:31,050
256 switches on every

467
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:34,230
floor and then again every switch might

468
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:36,000
have up to 256<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans and so in this case</font>

469
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,730
I can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through every one of those</font>

470
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">nipples all those bites and I can</font>

471
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:45,510
subdivide so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance at the VLAN</font>

472
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,270
level i can say company<font color="#E5E5E5"> x is that the</font>

473
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,730
this veal and in this hub that's the

474
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,590
apple and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can even if i have the</font>

475
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,080
spaceport potentially match the exact

476
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,270
same VLAN number in a different hub i

477
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,629
can write<font color="#E5E5E5"> little strips that will carve</font>

478
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,860
through and select and go oh here's

479
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,920
here's the same security zone<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

480
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,929
match these so again you you have a

481
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,180
chance to actually self document and

482
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:12,770
make your apples easier to machine

483
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:15,420
generate database generate and maintain

484
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:19,320
there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

485
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,420
consider when you are doing prefixes in

486
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,169
much the same way that no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one will route</font>

487
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,240
a longer than / 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> in on the ipv4 world</font>

488
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:31,230
and many isps won't throughout anything

489
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,910
longer than 22 currently everybody's

490
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,460
saying if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're longer than 48 if</font>

491
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,260
you're 50 or 52<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will not announce that</font>

492
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,480
particular prefix I will only<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced</font>

493
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:44,250
at 48 so if you have six sites that are

494
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,460
geographically distinct with different

495
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:50,940
connectivity you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the next</font>

496
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:55,170
size up row / 44 so you can give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> / 48</font>

497
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,960
to every one of your disparate sites the

498
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,840
recommendation is to give 64's to all

499
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,300
subnets this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that posts are</font>

500
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,250
on don't go longer than 64 for anything

501
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has a host on it because slack or</font>

502
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,900
stateless<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto-configuration assumes and</font>

503
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,140
requires that the rightmost 64 bits is

504
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,590
the host portion of the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

505
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,480
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> undoubtedly find cheap switches and</font>

506
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,830
cheap routers and cheap middleware boxes

507
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,100
that have already<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hard-coded is 64 don't know of any</font>

509
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,810
offhand but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will buy a beer to</font>

510
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,360
somebody if they can prove to me that

511
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:33,899
there is no code out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there that is</font>

512

already written that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken the</font>

513

only other two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to see other than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 60 fours are see 6164</font>

515
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,009
recommends that

516
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:46,109
for security reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use / 127 s for</font>

517
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:47,840
your point-to-point links because there

518
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:50,820
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> only two nodes there is no neighbor</font>

discovery or neighbor<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache that can be</font>

520
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:57,029
corrupted it takes away a security issue

521
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:00,119
and it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much if you're already</font>

522
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:02,129
doing / 31 s four point two points and

523
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:05,039
all of your router and switching links

524
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:08,039
and / 32 s for your loop backs and

525
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,590
you're using your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp you internally</font>

carry all of the loop<font color="#E5E5E5"> backs in</font>

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,999
externally peering 127 s4 point2 points

528
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,439
and 128 for loop backs and you're going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a happy camper it's going to work</font>

530
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the same what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I usually recommend</font>

531
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,710
is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a / 64 out of your</font>

532
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:29,238
address space for point2 points and a /

533
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:32,129
64 for your loop backs / routing domain

534
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:35,249
so if you have a segmented network for

535
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:37,769
you to places you can't obviously put

536
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:39,059
point-to-point links here and here how

537
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:41,369
did the same 64 because you've

538
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,470
fragmented your network so give us 64

539
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:46,168
for loop back so 64 for point2 points

540
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:51,239
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of every unique routing domain you</font>

541
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:53,039
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing good news bad news the</font>

542
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:56,039
good news is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know how it</font>

543
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,600
works since be4 and you understand why

00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would want provider independent</font>

545
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,269

551
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,919
that simply means is yet you already

00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:19,019
know why you want it before same thing

553

and the justifications are as<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy or</font>

554
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:24,179
easier with v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest change right</font>

disparate sites with no internal

558

claim multi home and get provider

independent space for all of those but

560
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:38,730
the rirs are very stingy about that if

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,310
configuring the way they work is there

571
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,740
are what are called RA or router

572
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,240
advertisement messages so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

router and all of your switch ports on

your network now suddenly send out

575
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:25,900
messages to tell your clients what they

576
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:27,550
need to do to configure now the

577
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,370
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> part here is that in most</font>

578
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:32,050
cases now you either statically

579
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,679
configure your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of your</font>

580
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:37,990
hosts or you set them to auto configure

581
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,270
and then you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP so if you are</font>

582
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:43,030
doing your network configuration for

your policy security policy checks you

584
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:47,950
validate that by downloading all your

DHCP configurations looking through<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

586
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:53,380
and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems to do what you</font>

every router in every switch port

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,380
everywhere on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network to make sure</font>

590
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,170
that they are correctly configured to

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:06,040
send out rabbit advertisements with what

592
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:09,370
you want so that's a pretty big change

593
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,350
in how you do things and depending on

594
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,899
how you are set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up different departments</font>

595
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,659
may now suddenly need to play together

596
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,480
because your router of folks and your

597
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,920
DHCP server folks if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

same both have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things potentially</font>

599
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:28,480
to get things working with Ras<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface</font>

600
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:30,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">ID generation i talked about you take FP</font>

601
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,220
80 and you slam this address on it and

602
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,060
that's how you get your link local what

603
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:39,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">usually done by default is an EU</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i-64</font>

604
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:42,370
which basically takes your mac address

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,570
which is 48<font color="#CCCCCC"> fits runs it through an</font>

608
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:52,030
number and you just slam<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the end</font>

609
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:55,810
now by default Windows 7<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Vista will</font>

610
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:58,270
generate a random number instead you can

611
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:02,230
change a registry value to make them

612
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:04,690
generating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UI 64 or not servers and</font>

613
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,100
linux and unix variants all pretty much

614
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">use eui-64</font>

615
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:14,429
so what you do is you take your mac

616
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,620
address and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 bits and you</font>

617
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,390
cut it in half there's a cute little

618
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:23,669
thing down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the seventh bid is</font>

619
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:25,950
inverted to say that this was a global

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">MAC address IE is a public registered</font>

622
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,979
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that default case and</font>

623
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:35,220
leave it alone and have the inverted bit

624
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:38,190
be4 the exception but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF they like</font>

625
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,170
fun so you invert the seven fit you cut

626
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,240
it in half and then you stick<font color="#E5E5E5"> FFP into</font>

627
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,560
the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so for you the first</font>

628
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,850
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is as soon as you look</font>

629
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:51,000
at a v6 address if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that there</font>

630
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:53,370
are six hex digits and then FF and then

631
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">a PE and then six more hex digits you</font>

632
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,820
can pretty much assume that that's a mac

633
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,560
address and then it's an eui-64

634
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,659
generated you immediately know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

635
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,100
you know to flip that bit and you can

636
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,590
then reverse engineer what the mac

637
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:09,959
address of the machine is from dead

638
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:12,389
eui-64 so / stateless auto config let's

639
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:16,800
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through what happens when you are</font>

642
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,220

643
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:27,419

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:30,750
eui-64 it'll then take that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I 64</font>

645
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:33,450
slammed onto FB 80 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will say okay</font>

00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's my link local address temporary</font>

647
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,410
I'm not sure if it's usable yet but

648
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,820
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm hoping that I can use</font>

649
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,280
then whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do is call deuces an</font>

00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,680
this is available<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will criminally</font>

656
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,840
configure it if this is the you know the

657
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,430
classics is you bought a bunch of

658
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,620
network cards on sale from somebody in

659

<font color="#CCCCCC">Taiwan and you discover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after you light</font>

660

it up that you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 cards all of which</font>

661
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,070
have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> mac address so what will</font>

662
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen in that case would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be six is that</font>

665
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,650
answer and it will win and it will use

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> address the second guy that comes</font>

668
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,340
he is going to say is anybody using it

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,490
the first guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> going so go yeah i'm</font>

670
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:31,500
using it going to run a random number

671
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:34,200
add that to its eui-64 and then try dat

672
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:37,320
again and statistically speaking because

673
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,910
it's randomly generated the odds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

with 12 machines all using that same mac

676

address it's statistically very unlikely

677
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a duplicate the first</font>

time certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> not by the second time so</font>

679
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:55,379
23 seconds and you're done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

680
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:57,149
a unique address at the link local the

00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,650
next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is from your link</font>

682
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,470
local addresses and now you have a

683
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:04,140
legitimate ipv6 address so no broadcast

684
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:06,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you have a real address you send</font>

other hosts no other servers have to

someone needs one here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my router</font>

the instructions they need to configure

694
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:31,800
and potentially tell them to dhcpv6

695
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:34,850
that's the other you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't dhcp anymore</font>

696
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:40,320

697
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:44,189
that you will dhcpv6 so the things that

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">you will get in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RA you will get the</font>

00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:54,030
to use on that particular interface and

701
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:57,330
for that particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and if the</font>

it tells you you were allowed to auto

704
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,840

of those prefixes just like you did<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,690
you will do duplicate address detection

709
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,850
and assuming nobody answers you will

710
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">then add that to the list of dresses you</font>

00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,980
you will try that with all three

713
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,770
prefixes until you have addresses in all

714
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,990
three prefixes so you could simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

715
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,540
linked local plus three other prefixes

716
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,250
all in the interface other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

717
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,409
it includes is the routers link local

718
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,530
address because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use the routers</font>

719
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:37,890
link-local as your next top for your

720
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,899
gateway and it will tell you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

721
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,870
you should keep that route before you

722
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,420
query and see if you should change it

723
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,459
and relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority so if you get</font>

724
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,440
multiple RA responses back all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

726
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,610
at the relative priorities sort them and

727
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,310
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you as the client will decide</font>

728
00:32:53,610 --> 00:33:00,030
which to use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> o flag which says get your other</font>

732
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:12,420

733
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:14,910
decide to use slack an auto config for

734
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,910
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> address and only use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP for</font>

737
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:27,570
RA doesn't give you that information now

00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,640
recently the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RA could send up dns</font>

744
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,980
servers the other thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

745
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:48,630
odd it's perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hand a prefix</font>

746
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,300
let the client auto configure their own

00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:54,590

749
00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:00,209
works fine operationally it's a little

750
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,939
funky and probably annoying to

751
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,410
troubleshoot but technically it works

752
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,110
last thing you'll get is the MTU how big

753
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:10,168
is the pipe of your upstream so again we

754
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,790
talked about fragmentation what you get

755
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">is you get a packet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too big message from</font>

756
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:16,230
any intervening box anywhere along your

757
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,940
path that can't throw the packet up its

758
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,280
upstream because it's too big so

759
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,350
obviously you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

760
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,909
maximum packet is at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your first hop so</font>

761
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,589
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to waste time doing that</font>

762
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:29,520
when you first start sending packet

763
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:33,179
flows things that are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in the</font>

764
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,940
messages though you can't get ntp you

765
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,980
can't get all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

766
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,300
only recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you get recursive</font>

767
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,639

00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp because you can't DHCP without</font>

an RA to tell you to dhcp

770
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:53,879
and you can't just ra because you don't

771
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:56,879
get things like a dns server reliably<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

772
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,799
other configuration so effectively we

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:07,200
are stuck right now with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will run</font>

774
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:09,060
both everywhere so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will all have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

775
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,359
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are camps that are</font>

778
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:23,160
but there's a great deal of obstruction

779
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,290
to that move in the IETF the biggest

780
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,210
thing that's missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP is you can't</font>

781
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:31,440
get a default route so you have to use

782
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:33,180
the RA<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that also so even if I say a</font>

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,740
fight or autonomous address<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag off</font>

784
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,930
don't auto configure any of your

785
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:41,368
addresses and dhcp for everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

786
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:43,109
still have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have RA telling me both</font>

787
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:45,470
those things and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still have to have an</font>

788
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:49,348
RA to tell me what when default route is

789
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:50,910
so you are stuck with configuring all of

790
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:52,500
your edges every router and every switch

791
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,029
port everywhere in your network to

792
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,650
either turn on or turn off Ras

793
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,660
explicitly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have them correctly</font>

794
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,700
configured and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

795
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,640
have dhcp servers available or dhcp

796
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,470
relays to get you to a server in all

797
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,690
cases now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good things</font>

798
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:13,470
with dhcpv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bootp whoo-hoo-hoo p was</font>

799
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:16,349
a festering pile and dhcp v4 is

800
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:18,629
basically bootp with saddle bags<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

801
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:20,099
baling wire and a slew of vendor options

802
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,800
because people were too lazy to try and

803
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:26,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it legitimately through the IETF and</font>

804
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,770
not surprisingly the protocol is a mess

805
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,690
this is one of those times where the

806
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,869
IETF actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> re-engineering it from</font>

807
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:37,650
scratch was a feature currently you have

808
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:41,190
to run v4 and v6 DHCP servers at the

<font color="#E5E5E5">same time there are no dual stack dual</font>

811
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,140
made that easier there are new ports so

812
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,299
what you will find on a dual stack the

813
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,848

815
00:36:53,849 --> 00:37:01,829
supports they have somewhat cleaned up

816
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,598
vendor options this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hyah teacher</font>

817

who used to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know you</font>

you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a shiny turd we</font>

00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:13,680
still have vendor options we still have

00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,649
turds but we have shine them up and we

822
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,109
have made them at uppal type length and

823

standardized pretty consistent box in

you get to design and data structures in

835
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:54,119
but there was no authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how</font>

836
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:56,160
it worked so anybody could say<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

837
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,509
everybody in your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok time to get</font>

838
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,549
a new lease and if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow</font>

839
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:01,319
managed to trash the dhcp server and get

840
00:37:59,549 --> 00:38:03,359
yourself up shortly you became the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rogue</font>

841
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:07,640
DHCP server on the network and life was

842
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:11,038
that they have a password authentication

843
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,660
method for v6 that actually means that

844
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,489
the guy that you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> your leash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

845
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,469
originally is now the guy you're still

846
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:18,690
getting your lease from and it actually

847
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:20,729
works so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually leave</font>

848
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,430
reconfigure on which means you don't

849
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:26,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to wait for leases to expire you</font>

850
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:29,009
can actually essentially push network

851
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:30,869
changes so remembering is now vastly

852
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:32,160
less painful because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can use</font>

853
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,859

854
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,390
and all of the clients will happen to

855
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:38,519
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new addresses and they will</font>

856
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,229
quiesce so they will happily use the new

857
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,598
prefix but they'll keep using the old

858
00:38:40,229 --> 00:38:44,459
ones on persistent connections so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

859
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,920
could actually completely renumber and

my end users might never know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

you could do it during the day this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

the sequence for a DHCP transaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

now solicit<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertised request and reply</font>

870
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,320
and they used to listen advertise

871
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,790
because they are consistent with the

872
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,560
neighbor solicitation and neighbor

873
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:24,279
advertisement and router solicitation

874
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,360
and router advertisement what is nice is

875
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,010
they have broken some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

your logs have a better idea what's

878
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:35,680
going on currently in v4 if you look in

879
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:38,950

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,810
so pools are small so we exhaust our

only so much memory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kernels all that</font>

950
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:51,070
stuff reasonably speaking if you have

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,570
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 posts in a single subnet</font>

952
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,580
you're probably going to start having

953
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">some traffic problems and if you have</font>

over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4000 why would be surprised if you</font>

956
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:05,220

00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,900
18 quintillion it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

infinitesimally small fraction of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,490
space so<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely pay attention if you</font>

960
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,190
suddenly notice that even one percent of

961
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:16,419
your space in your pool is being used

962
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,650
something is sucking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up addresses and</font>

963
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:24,970
not giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them back and something is</font>

964
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:27,130
broken so failover well failover was

965
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:29,950
really there to solve two problems in

966
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:33,490
before one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that if you change</font>

967
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:35,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the v4 clients address midstream the</font>

968
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:38,740
client would notice and the user would

969
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:40,810
notice and we did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have pools that</font>

970
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,140
were big enough so we kept burning out

971
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:43,569
of

972
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:47,078
space so what failover allowed you to do

973
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:49,440
was have redundancy of two and only two

974
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:52,480
servers because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do them in pairs</font>

975
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,849
it allows you to share those so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

976
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,380
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if one server's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down the clients</font>

977
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:57,519
can still get<font color="#E5E5E5"> their same address back so</font>

978
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,859
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change their address</font>

979
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,959
you have that redundancy and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

980
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:09,130
twice as many servers serving that same

981
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:11,920
pool that's no longer a problem in b6

982
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:14,470
we've already found out that you can

983
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,450
change addresses willy-nilly and the

984
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:19,078
clients tax field very gracefully with

985
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:21,129
it in a very user transparent way so

986
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:25,150
changing address is no longer a problem

987
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:27,940
and obviously 18 quintillion addresses

988
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,920
should be enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> for most of us since</font>

989
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is four billion Internet's worth of</font>

990
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,670
address space and failover is

991
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:38,589
spectacularly fragile if you've used it

992
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,359
it has interesting failure in recovery

993
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:42,130
modes it requires a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of care and</font>

994
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:44,558
feeding and it requires some fairly

1005
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:16,420
both set to do reconfigure that's where

1006
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:20,769
the server sends out a message and the

1007
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:23,799
clients this is like notifying DNS it

1008
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:25,390
simply takes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> refresh timer and sets</font>

it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you immediately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do an</font>

file reconfigure simply says instead of

1012
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:36,549
waiting half of least time before you do

1013
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:40,230
or a new request as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you get a</font>

00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,500
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it causes in the clients but</font>

1016
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:45,849
the client has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured to do it</font>

1017
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,569
and the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be configured and</font>

1018
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:52,799
know which clients will do reconfigure

1019
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:52,799
it does have security

1020
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,849
but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact that there is</font>

quiescence now and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact</font>

1022
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:03,010
that you can do this reconfigure it is

1023
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:06,040
quite conceivable that you can do

1024
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:10,480
rememberings live and your users won't

of problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it but the reality is</font>

1046
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,799
is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vast majority of all</font>

00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:09,700
anybody that has a home broadband

1050
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:14,710
corporation the odds are excellent that

1051
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:16,390
whoever is running their dhcp is

1052
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:18,160
identifying them and logging them and

1053
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:20,890
tracking them by their mac address so

1054
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,950
yes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is flawed but obviously it is a</font>

1055
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:27,339
workable<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution for most of us now DUI</font>

1056
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:29,740
d which is dhcp unique identifier is the

1057
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:36,150
IETF attempt to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1058
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:36,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">better than a mac address it is better</font>

1059
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:43,690
but yeah in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways however</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as with</font>

1060
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:47,680
all things in computers they<font color="#E5E5E5"> also suck</font>

1061

they just suck in different ways one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1062
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,490
the biggest problems is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a DUI</font>

1063
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:56,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">e that in theory right now be RFC has no</font>

1064

1065
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,250
you attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse engineer the mac</font>

1066
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:03,250
address you are specifically prohibited

1067
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,680
in rfcs from doing that right now so if

1068
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,060
you track v4 addresses by<font color="#E5E5E5"> MAC address</font>

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,819
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font>

1073
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:23,049
bit of fun the way you get a DUI d is

1074
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:25,930
there's an algorithm you run and the

1075
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,580
first time that you try and dhcp has a

1076
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:31,210
client where the first time that you

1077
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:33,160
invoke yourself as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP server you</font>

1078
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">will look in persistent storage in disk</font>

1079
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:39,129
and see if there's a DUI d already there

1080
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,530
if not you will use the algorithm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,500
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even if you change network</font>

one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

1094
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:18,640
one of the gotchas that they didn't

1095
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:21,100
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I take a machine that's</font>

1096
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,049
working and I decide that I'm going to

1097
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,790
clone this one engineering workstation

1098
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:28,330
and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten more from my engineering</font>

1099
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:31,180
department I don't think to wipe the

1100
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:33,310
leases file so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will all come up</font>

1101
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,080
they will look in the leases file and

1102
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:38,440
they will say oh I have a leases file

1103
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:40,630
and I have a DUI d and they will all try

1104
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:45,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an address and be told that duid</font>

1105
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:48,340
already has an address go away so you

1106
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:50,170
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you want to</font>

1107
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,240
preserve that make sure you back it up

1108
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:54,190
in the registry or in the disk file and

1109
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,379
if you don't want that to appear make

1110
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:57,910
sure that you wipe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out otherwise</font>

1111
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,790
you'll have interesting transitions

1112
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,379
later on so there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

1113
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:05,470
really are right one of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1114
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:08,380
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one single unique identifier</font>

1115
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:12,850
per machine regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

1116
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:15,880
network interfaces it has but you can

1117
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:18,250
actually differentiate with an identity

1118
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">association and IA for every network</font>

1119
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:24,610
interface and that pair that duple

1120
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:26,259
a DUI d plus I a uniquely identifies

1121
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:29,350
every single interface so you could

1122
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,180
actually have all of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP and the</font>

1123
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:34,990
server will know that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1124
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:36,609
entities or identities because they all

1125
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:40,600
have a unique key that pair makes a

1126
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:42,550
unique key and there are three types

1127
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,900
temporary addresses privacy addresses I

1128
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:46,540
haven't gone through i'll just do it

1129
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,660
very quickly because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that he</font>

to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i get an address there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1135
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,790
get in the logs and then i go to a

1136
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:04,359
coffee house and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i go to three</font>

1137
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:06,130
customers and somehow someone like the

1138
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,810
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> is able to get log files from</font>

1139
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,760
all over the places they will know it's

1140
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:12,640
me do this my mac address in all places

1141
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,680
and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so</font>

1142
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,900
we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do instead is create an</font>

1143
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,480
address that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is randomly generated and</font>

1144
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,640
changed usually every eight hours some

1145
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:24,670
as long as 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours but no longer than</font>

1146
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,730
24 hours that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use for unknown</font>

1147
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:29,230
connections out to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and so</font>

1148
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,690
they can only correlate one day of what

1149
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,369
I'm doing not weeks or months of where

1150
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:36,010
I've been going so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a privacy</font>

1151
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:38,010
addresses or temporary addresses non

1152
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:42,190
temporary which is mildly

1153
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:43,720
counterintuitive but because the

1154
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:46,180
addresses that i get from a dhcp server

1155
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,279
are sort of temporary in that I of Elise

1156
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:50,049
I only get them for my lease time I

1157
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,390
don't get them permanently either but

1158
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:55,840
they're not a temporary or privacy

1159
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:57,520
address so they are non temporary prefix

1160
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:00,160
delegation is the third and that's where

1161
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,410
instead of giving you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an address i can</font>

1162
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,480
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole range of addresses that</font>

1163
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:08,649
you can further carve out the model most

1164
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,510
commonly done is home router i have a

1165
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:12,520
subnet that has my home theater i have a

1166
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:14,109
subnet that as my home office I have

1167
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,640
submit that my kids are on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

1168
00:52:14,109 --> 00:52:17,529
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to segregate so that world of</font>

1169
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,830

1170
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:23,859

1171
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:26,020
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay giving me a / 64 is a</font>

1172
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:28,779
terribly helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> ksenia / 64 for every</font>

1173
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:31,600
one of those what you can do is you can

1174
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:34,799
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a prefix delegation and your home cpe</font>

1175
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:38,380
gets say a / 60

1176
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:41,440
which gets me up to 16 / 64<font color="#E5E5E5"> s that I can</font>

1177
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:44,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">then assign myself to subordinate</font>

1178
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,589
routers in and around my house so you

1179
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually do a hierarchical routing</font>

1180
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:51,308
infrastructure dynamically with prefix

1181
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:57,430
delegation not much support and routers

1182
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:59,950
yet but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has a lot</font>

1183
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:01,990
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentials they are still debating</font>

1184
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:04,960
how to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious other</font>

1185
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:07,450
missing piece is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1186
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,770
the upstream routing correctly does all

1187
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,450
the right things and how do you know

1188
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:14,200
subordinate devices do their default

1189
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:16,089
routes up correctly and there's an ietf

1190
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,410
group called home net that is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

the other changes you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pet</font>

1199
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:43,629
networking is security people with

00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:46,390
checklists of conventional wisdom which

1201
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:48,460
have stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is plain wrong has never</font>

1203
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:55,119

1204

only and TCP is only for zone transfers

1205
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,160
wrong never been right but I still go

1206
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,470
some places where they go here's our

1207
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:06,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">checklist and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have bought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP 53</font>

1208
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:08,169
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> insecure one of the other</font>

1209
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:10,509
places<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I just see it all the time</font>

1210
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,420
with before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to block</font>

1211
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:16,030
certain parts of ICMP v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> and allow ping</font>

1212
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:17,440
to work so we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> disable v4 ICMP</font>

1213
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:21,040
everywhere and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have no security</font>

1214
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:24,099
problems sure you have no bugging

1215
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:28,890
capability either but hey apparently you

1216
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:30,790
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that well icmpv6</font>

1217
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,160
here are some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1218
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:35,470
can't do if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have icmpv6</font>

1219
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,020
enabled you can't do duplicitous

1220
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,009
detection so those 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> taiwanese cards</font>

1221
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,000
are all going to sit there using the

1222
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,440
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and you're gonna have lots</font>

1223
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,950
of duplicate IP errors all over the

1224
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,970
place cool of course you also aren't

1225
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,529
going to have any default routes because

1226
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,828
there aren't any<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ras because you can't</font>

1227
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:52,099
ask for any messages

1228
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:54,349
you receive them that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICMP so you</font>

1229
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:57,410
can't do any slack so all you've got is

1230
00:54:54,349 --> 00:55:00,410
your link local address that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

1231
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:03,109
know is valid you can't get pack it too

1232
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:04,640
big so what happens the complete

1233
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:07,390
sequence is if I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a packet that is</font>

1234
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:10,700
too big for me I throw the packet away

1235
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:12,140
completely and the only thing I do other

1236
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,509
than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sent a packet too big and</font>

1237
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:16,759
here's how big my upstream is back to

1238
00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the original sender if they are blocking</font>

1239
00:55:16,759 --> 00:55:21,499
that they don't get that message they

1240
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,328
don't know it didn't go through so they

1241
00:55:21,499 --> 00:55:25,249
keep sending packets too big and I keep

1242
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:27,799
throwing away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eventually it times</font>

1243
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:31,729
out at layers four through seven and

1244
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:33,680
breaks you can't test any form of

1245
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:37,029
connectivity you don't get any form of

1246
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:39,910
networking errors so if you want

1247
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:43,130
basically in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pipple like experience of</font>

1248
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:46,129
a local<font color="#CCCCCC"> network with no useful servers</font>

1249
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,839
no dns no default gateway and probable

1250
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:50,089
duplicate addresses running around loose

1251
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:52,219
and nothing else that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do and you</font>

1252
00:55:50,089 --> 00:55:56,299
consider that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> usable network more</font>

00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:58,940
power<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you if however you actually</font>

1254
00:55:56,299 --> 00:56:01,309
want a functional internet you need to

00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:06,109
start filtering intelligently the nice

the ITF surprises me they're usually

they're great on protocols but not so

1266
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:42,170
great an operational stuff they wrote

00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:00,289
that are sufficiently dangerous or weird

1276
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:02,060
that are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in the lab most</font>

1277
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:03,620
people won't recommendations are

1278
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,880
great and the nice thing is that when

1279
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these security wants with their</font>

1280

1281
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:11,000

1282
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:13,880
is waving an RFC that they are directly

1283
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:21,140
violating in front of them so here it is

1284

here's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ammo and security pretty</font>

1552
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:26,358
just looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like data packets trailer</font>

1553
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:29,450
just looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like data packets doesn't</font>

1554
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:31,660
have a particular well-known set of ipv6

1555

doesn't use a well-known port doesn't

1557
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:39,290
use a well-known<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP protocol number and</font>

1558
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,850
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three knobs that you</font>

1559
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:43,670
pretty much have for all aquil based

1560
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:47,509
rules if you can't filter by address

1561
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:51,620
port or protocol number you are reduced

1562
01:09:47,509 --> 01:09:54,770
to signature-based detection and if you

1563
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:56,269
can't detect a tunnel even though in

1564
01:09:54,770 --> 01:10:00,860
theory you can disable<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade on the</font>

01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,350
admin privileges on their box which many

1568
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:11,120
engineers and sophisticated users demand

1569
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:12,680
and I set up a bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page I'm betting</font>

1570
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,450
it's not terribly hard to come up with a

to run a test with your device and i

will stick box behind this device and i

will set up a trade a tunnel server out

them do the right thing and the other

through your sis log files do they have

fixed data sizes in which you stick IP

addresses that are 32 bits long because

1611
01:11:54,270 --> 01:12:01,079
they'll probably be unhappy with 128

1612
01:11:56,369 --> 01:12:03,690
bits if you are using a commercial

network monitoring system or similar

1620
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:26,070
of your stuff is there you want a new

test you know it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you just</font>

1622

looked as my pool exhausted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problem well now it's it have I used one</font>

1624

percent of my 18 quintillion addresses

1625
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:37,530
if I have I want an alarm in my knock

1626
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:40,170
because one percent of that is millions

1627
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:44,190
or billions or chef some really large

1628
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:49,680
number of addresses used make sure that

1629
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:54,480
you can actually see what's going on so

1630
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:57,120
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> broad strokes I'd like to</font>

1631
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:07,650
take questions pretty much anything that

1632
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:13,190
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay rogue are raised and rogue</font>

1633
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:18,629
DHCP they are functionally equivalent

1634
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:21,480
there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes in order to be a</font>

01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:22,949
rogue or a or a rogue DHCP one of the

1636
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,870
barriers to entry that wasn't there is

1637
01:13:22,949 --> 01:13:27,449
at least yet you also have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on to</font>

1638
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:31,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link local of every domain to be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">able to corrupt it in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1640
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:33,870
relays would happen they filter it as

01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:35,549

1643
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:39,810
stream you were at risk so it's

1644
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:44,040
fractionally better in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that regard but</font>

1645
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:47,400
the risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mitigation are similar</font>

1646
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:51,170
in that yes if you succeed in being able

01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a rogue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RA or a rogue DHCP server</font>

1648
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:57,750
you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play man in the middle</font>

1649
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:59,130
because one of the things you do is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1650
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,390
were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a bad person and I were</font>

1651
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:02,160
doing a rogar a the first thing I would

1652
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:04,350
do is I would set the lifetime of my

1653
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,420
route to infinite<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would set my</font>

1654
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:08,250
priority to the most desirable and I

1655
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:11,280
would set the router default gateway to

1656
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:12,719
me and I would try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a dates if you</font>

1657
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,730
reconfigure just to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happened</font>

1658
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:19,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to rush the process along so</font>

1659
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:21,209
yeah and then basically you're stuck at

1660
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:29,030
man in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle is ultimately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1661
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:29,030
issue other questions

1662
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:44,920
I'm performance differences from the

1663
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors no they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not much at the large</font>

1664
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:49,380
iron level they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to the point</font>

1665
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,310
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know initially the</font>

1666
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,989
deficiencies in routing a packet header

1667
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:55,060
processing weren't as great in v6

1668
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:57,969
because it was still CPU switched it was

1669
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:59,770
in software pretty much all of the big

1670
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:01,180
router and switch vendors have gotten to

1671
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:05,890
the stage where<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's now actually down</font>

1672
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:07,030
in the ASIC and there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1673
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:09,400
performance sets that have shown that

1674
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:12,489
you can in a pure v6 network truly

1675
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:16,809
shovel off more packets they are not

1676
01:15:12,489 --> 01:15:18,610
pushing it yet sadly the other thing to

1677
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:20,290
consider also<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that that's really nice</font>

1678
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:22,989
but you essentially still have to deal

1679
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:27,010
with v4 so right now they're burning a

1680
01:15:22,989 --> 01:15:28,089
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM on the cards and space in the</font>

1681
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:30,100
cards dealing with the fact that they

1682
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:31,480
have to do dual stack when you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1683
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,160
to the point where you can do some kind

1684
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of transition at the edges and more of</font>

your core internal his v6 only I think

1686
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:39,070
is when we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start to see some</font>

1687
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:40,360

that actually functions as a quality of

service as opposed to a feeble wish that

1692

you hope kind of works

1695

dealing with ipv6 for years now and it's

1698
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:28,110
stable and it works the same way as long

1708
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:57,060
because the internet never throws away a

1709
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:58,440
really bad idea ever but bias is was

1710
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:03,480
originally written with an abstraction

1711
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:06,330
layer you know function ly speaking ospf

1712
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:08,759
and is is our link state flooding

1713
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:11,250
algorithms and they are functionally

1714
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:14,100
very similar there's an abstraction

1715
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:15,780
layer and is is there's area<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 in ospf</font>

1716
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:17,760
but functionally they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking so</font>

1717
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:20,550
and before normally when somebody asked

<font color="#CCCCCC">me my response is culturally through you</font>

01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:25,530
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPF already use ospf if you're</font>

1721
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:29,280
in general where you can see backbone

1722
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:31,679
and providers are going to be more

1723
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,179
likely use is is folks that are any

casting you're doing post<font color="#E5E5E5"> pastes are</font>

1725
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:40,800
more likely to be in ospf that's the

1726
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:43,050
general case that's before in v6 things

1727
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,980
have shifted because of the fact that is

1728
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:48,989
is was written specifically to be

1729
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:51,480
protocol agnostic because it was

1730
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:55,440
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle IP and seal and s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

1731
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:58,049
SI cela n'est both it already had an

1732
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:00,900
abstraction layer so is is works quite

1733
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:04,140
clean and you can run a v4 and v6

1734
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:07,940
routing process in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same is is</font>

instant in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same rib</font>

1736
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:14,600
ospf was written with overly intimate

1737
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,340
knowledge of IP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do mean exactly</font>

1738
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:20,300
what you're thinking when I say overly

1739
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:23,510
intimate knowledge of ipv4 so when they

1740
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:24,980
tried to do ipv6 they essentially had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1741
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:27,080
do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looked like it from</font>

1742
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:32,200
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside but was completely different</font>

1743
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">internally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the result is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that ospfv3</font>

1744
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:38,090
usually cannot run in the same process

1745
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:40,940
so if you're doing v4 and v6 you will

1746
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:42,560
have two sets of ribs you will have two

1747
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:44,690
processes running on your router

1748
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,190
simultaneously and you will take up

1749
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:50,750
double the<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would with</font>

1750
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:52,820
just running v4 or v6 there is an RFC

01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:55,730
which I can't recall<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of</font>

1752
01:18:52,820 --> 01:19:00,590

they're throwing around a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32 so</font>

1762
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:26,540
else relatively small so running two

1763
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:28,519
processes probably is it hugely

1764
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:30,110
expensive and if you're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

ospf and again culturally you're

01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:35,000
comfortable with that then go with that

that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other new thing is if you were</font>

01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:45,710
trying to pick and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you're doing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">more solid in a single process right now</font>

another oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so user authentication</font>

1776
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:22,550
such as PPP for dsl provider what it

1777
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:24,888
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> boils down to is is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as what</font>

1778

now happens is your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp server is</font>

1779
01:20:24,889 --> 01:20:31,730
usually hacked to do chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> pap for PPP</font>

1780
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:34,670
or some other unholy database lookup

1781
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:36,080
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually MAC address and then</font>

1782
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:38,000
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those things that will</font>

1783
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a decision as to how it can tout an</font>

1785
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:45,620
provisioning in before then what you'll

1786
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:48,290
probably wind up doing is you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do slack you don't want clients to</font>

1788
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:50,810
pick their own addresses because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1789
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:53,989
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> fatter your pool them you don't</font>

1791
01:20:53,989 --> 01:20:58,968
to a particular user so what you'll do

1792
01:20:55,909 --> 01:21:01,190
instead is you will advertise a prefix

1793
01:20:58,969 --> 01:21:02,900
but set the a flag or autonomous address

1794
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,940
flight to off saying don't auto

1795
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,739
configure anything on yourself so you'll

1796
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:09,799
only auto configure link local address

1797
01:21:06,739 --> 01:21:12,799
and get it fall gateway because you

1798
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:14,960
can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in dhcp but then set the</font>

1799
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:18,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">0 and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> M flags to on and have all of</font>

1800
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:20,929
the other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up to the DHCP server</font>

1801
01:21:18,409 --> 01:21:22,849
and then again you can have to dhcp

1802
01:21:20,929 --> 01:21:24,590
server to do the authentication the

1803
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:26,719
missing piece right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is that</font>

1804
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:29,600
currently the way most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those work is</font>

1805
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's an HW add or field that can be</font>

1806
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,870
sent by the relay or by the client which

1807
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,760
is your hardware address of your mac

1808
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:37,219
address so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only do you get it in a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hands you the mac address which the</font>

no HW adder fields port into HP v6 there

1815
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:59,929
is an ietf draft that is likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font>

1816
01:21:56,350 --> 01:22:03,290
hopefully in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paris next month that would</font>

1817
01:21:59,929 --> 01:22:05,510
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server to then get that once you</font>

1818
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:07,820
update the client which of course in

1819
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:11,060
most cable or DSL providers there

1820
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:13,369
painting what CPUs are acceptable and

1821
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:15,710
they also control their own server so

1822
01:22:13,369 --> 01:22:17,900
that's effectively what you do you would

1823
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:20,599
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware address again and then</font>

1824
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:24,348
you would use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as your key you do</font>

1825
01:22:20,599 --> 01:22:26,449
your look up by whatever means and then

01:22:24,349 --> 01:22:29,389
if you're truly doing the layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or</font>

garden envy for all of these six stuff

01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,530
will go through fine and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> suspect that</font>

1849
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:19,579
again is going to be what most of the

providers are going to do for walled

the ITF will have had to have thought of

01:23:27,829 --> 01:23:36,940
how to get around so other questions

1856
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:09,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah so carrier-grade NAT NAT 64</font>

1857

1885
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,860
they don't they can't and the providers

either because streaming video to a

1914
01:26:26,329 --> 01:26:33,799
period of time I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that anyone</font>

1915
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:35,570
thinks it will be the solution and

1916
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,829
anybody who has a clue<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't think</font>

1917
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:41,540
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an acceptable solution</font>

1918
01:26:36,829 --> 01:26:44,570
for very long now that said for things

and you know most people say oh yeah

1925
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:57,259
check all your switches and all your

1926
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:58,280

1927
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:00,590
networking thing so check all your

1928
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:04,040
networking gear and some people are

1929

savvy enough to go check all<font color="#E5E5E5"> your os's I</font>

1930

usually say anything that fits packets

on some form of network and runs on some

1932

foreign power needs to be validated

1933
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:19,820
which means things like badge card
