1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,979
our second speaker this afternoon is

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be Lee Howard he's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the director</font>

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">of network technology at time warner</font>

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,929
cable he'll be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some</font>

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:16,590
interesting work<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're looking at</font>

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:18,590
costs of ipv4 and ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual-stack good</font>

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">afternoon it's always fun to talk in</font>

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,859
middle the afternoon because everybody's

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,600
had lunch it's bright and sunny outside

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,810
so we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance to gather some</font>

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,939
rays and now we're inside and it's a

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">little dim so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and stay</font>

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,719
lively I may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to be quite as</font>

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,850
lively as the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I was here well</font>

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,370
i'm back<font color="#CCCCCC"> at nanigen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dallas i talked</font>

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,410
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the total cost of</font>

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,968
ownership of carrier-grade NAT and my

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">conclusion was it's kind of expensive</font>

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,920
and I then compared the cost of

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,620
carrier-grade NAT to the cost of buying

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,480
addresses ipv4 addresses on a transfer

22
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,010
market and I kind of came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some</font>

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,538
comparisons and some ramifications there

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,219
and had a lot of fun with the thought

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,960
experiment and one of the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

26
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,370
that every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it one of</font>

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,609
the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back was</font>

28
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,128
well okay with the alternative you keep

29
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,200
saying everybody needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ad ipv6</font>

30
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything's going to run ipv6 anyway</font>

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,990
but what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it cost to do ipv6 and I</font>

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,220
kept saying well yeah it's too hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

33
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">it there are too many different things</font>

34
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,509
if there's there's there are too many

35
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,430
variables it's it's too far different

36
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,680
from company to company to figure it out

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,630
and finally I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right it's time</font>

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and say is there at</font>

39
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,429
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> a framework by which we can sort</font>

40
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,530
of evaluate what what the possible costs

41
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,780
are and are there any kinds of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

42
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,220
we can cluster similar things together

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,079
and so that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to come and</font>

44
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,579
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to try and provide a</font>

45
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,220
framework to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help people think about</font>

46
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,889
what costs are for a given whether it's

47
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,130
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization network segment or</font>

48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as a whole so the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

49
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,539
the structure that I've created is to

50
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,530
say there's the deployment costs what it

51
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,509
costs to enable ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual-stack to begin</font>

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,640
with and then there's the ongoing

53
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,740
operational costs what it costs to

54
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,259
maintain a network that is running<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual</font>

55
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,240
stack and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about dual</font>

56
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,429
stacks as opposed to single stack

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,440
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've already talked about what</font>

58
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,080
if you're doing a carrier-grade NAT

59
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,410
solution or a buying addresses solution

60
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,350
so

61
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,609
sort of the other side of that path<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

62
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,290
the way it looks to me is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

63
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,200
reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of break things down</font>

64
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,810
into these various segments so data

65
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,820
centers hosting providers content

66
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,350
providers tend to have similar sets of

67
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,810
things to look at when it comes to what

68
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,370
their costs are going to be ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 have</font>

69
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,020
similar things enterprise networks tend

70
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,250
to have certain set of things and

71
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously there are similarities between</font>

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,980
them and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about those when i</font>

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,510
get there but that's that's the

74
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,660
fundamental part that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to</font>

75
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,780
was deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and operational</font>

76
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,310
costs it's very important for me to say

77
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to acknowledge people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help me with</font>

78
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,180
this so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I went about trying to</font>

79
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what the framework would look</font>

80
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,830
like as I said gee there are in fact

81
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,230
documents describing how one should or

82
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,720
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack ones network whether</font>

83
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,810
one is a data center operator or an ISP

84
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,340
or an enterprise network so i went to

85
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the authors of those documents and said</font>

86
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">i see the framework that you that you've</font>

87
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,510
described as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see the tasks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've</font>

88
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,369
listed as needing to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done what what</font>

89
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,049
does it take to wait do I have the costs

90
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,150
right because those documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

91
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,730
necessarily describe the cost so these

92
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,320
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely gave me comments back</font>

93
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,769
and I've incorporated their comments as

94
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,720
best as I can into into what I'm doing

95
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,160
anything obviously anything that's true

96
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and good it comes from them anything</font>

97
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,109
that's bad blame goes to me so thanks

98
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,400
blame thanks to them blame to me in

99
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,830
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to point out Richard</font>

100
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">jimmerson and the deploy 360 team I did</font>

101
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,550
get some comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you on George who</font>

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,500
is around<font color="#E5E5E5"> here someplace and from Dan</font>

103
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,030
York I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I got all their</font>

104
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,980
comments into the slide so I'll try and

105
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">catch those as I go on beyond feel free</font>

106
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,619
to jump up and tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I missed so</font>

107
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,780
deployment costs like starting with data

108
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,480
center and this is again sort of lumping

109
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,090
together similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> ish things from where I</font>

110
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,079
stand on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet the data center</font>

111
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:08,100
posting content providers and I and my

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,100
student starting point here is draft

113
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,079
Lopez v6 ops DC ipv6 which I've got

114
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,480
listed on the slide and sets an internet

115
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,419
draft that's being discussed at the v6

116
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,700
ops working group at IETF and the idea

117
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:23,280
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say if you're if you're a you know</font>

118
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,510
an operator data center operator what

119
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,690
are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to think</font>

120
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,360
about as you're migrating to<font color="#E5E5E5"> as your</font>

121
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,860
ipv6 is migrating<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual-stack so here's</font>

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,600
the here's here's what it comes down to

123
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,750
you've got to do firewalls and routers

124
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,730
and switches and security appliances and

125
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,940
load balancers all of the hardware that

126
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:44,030
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in a data center it turns out</font>

127
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,640
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me like routers load</font>

128
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,460
balancers switches most of these things

129
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually support ipv6 now and generally</font>

130
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:56,780
pretty good pretty well they most

131
00:04:51,830 --> 00:05:01,340
important in general existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware</font>

132
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:03,650
can support v6 in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware some of them</font>

133
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,489
need software upgrades new iOS versions

134
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,750
or OS versions new bug fixes few

135
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,550
features depending on exactly what

136
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,290
you've implemented sure but general you

137
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to buy new hardware you just</font>

138
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,920
need to beat on your vendor to give you

139
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,990
the features that you need the the

140
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,020
exception here is security appliances

141
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,610
there's still a lot of firewalls maybe

142
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,409
yes or no depending how old your

143
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,550
firewalls are if you're running a data

144
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,650
center and you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really old</font>

so there's what's your data center doing

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,280
can't tell you whether those development

184
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,690

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,700
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be significant so that's</font>

189
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,020
sort of mixed news good news bad news

190
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,390
right there's some money<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

191
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,510
required but not not that much let's

192
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:06,180
let's take a look at the at the next set

193
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:10,320
isps similar kinds of things now there's

194
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,840
a an RFC out for strategies for dual

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,430
stacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP wireline incremental ipv6</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm one of the co-authors on that one</font>

197
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,500
and it's and it turns out so there are a

198
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,870
couple of different chunks of things

199
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,090
that need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done but it turns out if</font>

200
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,000
your backbone isn't already ipv6 capable

201
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,250
you are running a really old or really

202
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,170
small backbone like you might want to

203
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,950
consider using a vendor other than

204
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,900
belkin for ipv4 your backbone your

205
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,280
access network though depending on what

206
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,140
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> access network you're running</font>

207
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,359
may need some upgrades and again it

208
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,430
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how old it is but and whether</font>

209
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,630
that's a whether it's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> UD slam beer</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have you may have to do some edge</font>

215
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,130
upgrades there but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again</font>

where you are the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center will go</font>

220

provisioning and operational support

224
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,860
systems those are again same same kind

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">of development dollars although the</font>

226
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,110
trick here for an ISP is those are that

227
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,030
maybe depends on whether you wrote the

228
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,060
system's in-house or bought off the

229
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:36,089
shelf stuff so it turned it looks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

230
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,199
though as if you either need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

231
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,669
software in which case you're going to

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend a little bit more or you need to</font>

at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least do the systems integration to</font>

236
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,030
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a little bit of work</font>

either way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course work work of</font>

238
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:53,250
dollars same with monitoring it's a

239
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,880
little bit more there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

240
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,380
more going on

241
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,939
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for isps because they have all of</font>

242
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,070
those different levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things to</font>

243
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,450
monitor and don't forget your customer

244
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,520
ticketing system and your outage

245
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,780
ticketing system because you probably

246
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,579
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to reference the address</font>

247
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,920
or where the trouble is<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming from in</font>

248
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,510
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those and then the big one is</font>

249
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,479
cpe so the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the big one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

250
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:19,319
that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the one that's a per</font>

251
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,790
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost everything else is you</font>

252
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,950
have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and once you've done it</font>

253
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,319
it affects<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of your customers cpe is</font>

254
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:30,150
per customer now that could be whether

255
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's modems or 0 NT s or acoustic</font>

256
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,910
couplers or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know fiber technologies</font>

257
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,800
whatever it is that we or could be home

258
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,020
routers whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets</font>

259
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,609
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your ISP puts in the home</font>

260
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,120
that's what we're talking about it needs

261
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,520
to support ipv6 the good news is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

262
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,160
many do the bad news<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that not all do</font>

263
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,579
and there's a wide diversity of support

264
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,589
among CP provided by ISPs it's

265
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,650
incredibly wide and we're seeing lots of

266
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:01,410
great support from from some ISPs and

267
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,329
some CP manufacturers and a little bit

268
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,430
less strong in other cases so that's a

269
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,280
big one now I guess I meant to point out

270
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,560
those capital expenditures on cpe and

271
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,199
your access network capital expenditures

272
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,800
in general are well they're cheaper if

273
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you spread</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them out over time because</font>

274
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,130
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do an upgrade anyway</font>

275
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually right that's just we accept</font>

276
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as being part of the normal life of</font>

277
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,800
other network so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

278
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,220
upgrade so if you just roll ipv6 support

279
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,750
into that upgrade your fine the trouble

280
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,390
is that you may not have already started

281
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,860
that upgrade cycle so if you started

282
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,990
four years ago you're probably in pretty

283
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,700
good shape right now if you haven't

284
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">started four years ago then step one is</font>

285
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,750
get a tardy<font color="#E5E5E5"> asst because you've got work</font>

286
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,350
to do and like I bt6 it's bigger on the

287
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,370
inside if you can't start four years ago

288
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,750
then you're probably going to spend

289
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of money to</font>

290
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,750
replace equipment it's just can be in a

291
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,230
compressed time frame this is true for

292
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:59,250
the capital expenses for any of these

293
00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:01,140
segments of the industry the enterprise

<font color="#E5E5E5">network this is one I actually kind of</font>

295
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,120
like in in this particular conversation

296
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,680
because there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I've</font>

297
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,720
written in big green letters

298
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,670
money there's there's no there's not a

299
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,410
lot of capital involved to upgrade the

300
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,939
enterprise network so I've got another

301
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,469
another draft I'm a co-author in this

302
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,050
draft to and how an enterprise network

303
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,310
and include ipv6 support and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a</font>

304
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,540
couple of different strategies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

305
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,329
don't want to debate because they're

306
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,699
good arguments for working outside in or

307
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,320
inside out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are considerations</font>

308
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,050
with either approach that's that's not

309
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the point the point is that</font>

310
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">either way either way you start you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to deal with the same</font>

312
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,740
considerations so on the external<font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

313
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:44,640
your access provider needs to support

314
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:47,850
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that most major ISPs in the</font>

315
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,390
US and probably North America support

316
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:54,690
ipv6 on their dedicated commercial

317
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,100
access networks I can't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that about</font>

318
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,810
residential access networks that might

be sold to a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> or small home or</font>

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">potentially debatable but I think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to worry about your LAN access now here</font>

328
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,930
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about the wide area network</font>

329
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,360
between your individual sites assuming

330
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:28,380
it's not through the internet so if

331
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,860
you're using one of the large one of the

332
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,939
large ISPs private backbones to move

333
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,040
traffic between your enterprise

334
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,490
locations that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need support</font>

349
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,500
we talk about what's the first thing an

do is make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> their firewall doesn't</font>

talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them monitoring back to your</font>

sure your vendors are supporting it

366

we're at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point now where it's it's</font>

369
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,839
alternatives and you can tell them

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,380
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about routers and switches they</font>

support v6 mostly we've noticed that

404
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:10,260
they get a v6 address on the land but

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,400
support ipv6 or they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running on</font>

431
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,200
just using the library that comes with

432
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,819
the operating system and they do you're

433
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,050
going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some testing but</font>

434
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,400
you're probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you're not</font>

435
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to die I wouldn't expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you up to</font>

436
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend more money to get there all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

437
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,110
that sort of cost to get to running dual

438
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,610
stack so there's some money in some of

439
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,490
those cases in the case of the

440
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,930
enterprise network it's mostly labor and

441
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,220
I'm sorry because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that's the hard</font>

442
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,290
thing for enterprise network operators

443
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's labor there's a lot of work to do</font>

444
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you folks you have a lot of work to</font>

445
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,230
do already but at least is no capital

446
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:43,360
you don't have to go defend a major

447
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:45,100
expense operational costs now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

448
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
starts to get interesting so what

449
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,750
happens once you're running a dual stack

450
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,520
network and you have a router code

451
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,100
version upgrade or even you're

452
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,890
evaluating a new router for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

453
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,690
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test that</font>

454
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,699
probably at least twice maybe three

455
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,070
times and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the iterations and</font>

456
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,240
that they're here so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

457
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,130
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing you've always done</font>

458
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">right because you've always done it you</font>

459
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,770
have to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least that much</font>

460
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,660
testing and whether that's just a unit

461
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">test for the new features</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a full</font>

462
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,709
regression test I don't know it's your

463
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,520
network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested how you want to but</font>

464
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,070
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least going to do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

465
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,530
test then you have to do the additional

466
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,419
tests for the v6 specific stuff making

467
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,250
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it actually spells v6</font>

468
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,250
correctly and does neighbor discovery

469
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:30,460
and all the important things now do you

470
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,500
do an IP VIP v4 iteration and a dual

471
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,580
stack iteration and an ipv6 only

472
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:39,250
iteration or do you just do v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dual</font>

473
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,370
stack kind of up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you your your rules</font>

474
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,540
your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you decide but there's</font>

475
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be additional work any way you</font>

476
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it every time you evaluate a new</font>

477
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,860
vendor or new code there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

478
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,779
additional work because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

479
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to test a couple of extra things</font>

480
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:55,210
how much work well ok once you've got

481
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:56,979
the hardest part in evaluating new

482
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,960
router<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plugging the thing</font>

483
00:17:56,979 --> 00:18:01,359
in is getting the darn thing racked it

484
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,559
in you in your in your lab and getting

485
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,239
plugged<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the right places and</font>

486
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,039
getting it configured and making sure

487
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:07,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the connections</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are working and then</font>

488
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,859
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually start running your</font>

489
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:12,009
tests and once you have your test plan

490
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:13,658
going adding on an additional set of

491
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:16,210
test plans doesn't actually take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

492
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:18,219
much more work it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

493
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,419
that much<font color="#CCCCCC"> bigger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that big a deal so</font>

494
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:21,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I get you may have to do two</font>

495
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:23,349
or three rounds but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably only</font>

496
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,499
if it takes you a day or two to set

497
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:28,869
everything up and half a day to test

498
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:30,729
maybe it's only another power a couple

499
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:32,799
to add on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 or the dual stack round</font>

500
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:34,589
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably only ten percent that's</font>

501
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,940
not that big that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that big a deal</font>

502
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:38,440
your QA group if you have a separate

503
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,440
network engineering at QA may have to be

504
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,999
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's the operating</font>

505
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,229
in trouble so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some extra</font>

506
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">money there there's there's a little</font>

507
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:48,519
extra time is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cost a little bit</font>

508
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,489
more now operating troubleshooting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

509
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,619
so we've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems at the ISP</font>

510
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:56,200
tend to fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> into layer 1 layer 2 layer</font>

511
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:58,830
3 generally not too much higher in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

512
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,479
stack if it's a layer 1 layer 2 problem

513
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,820
generally once you're paying six works

514
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:07,330
your ping works right yes you probably

515
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,649
do want to be thorough and also ping you

516
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,849
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm starting with ping 6 of</font>

517
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,559
course because naturally<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the one</font>

518
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:14,678
you'll troubleshoot first right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

519
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:16,029
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> build those good habits but once</font>

520
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:18,700
you're adding an extra paying that's

521
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:21,849
what 30 seconds big deal that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

522
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's you know trivial a layer 3</font>

523
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:25,178
problem may or may not be separate

524
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,668
depends what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is if you're</font>

525
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:29,799
bgp if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got different paths if</font>

526
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,019
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to troubleshoot why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

527
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,210
ipv6 path is taking is much longer than

528
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:35,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">you v4 path that's a totally different</font>

529
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,940
you've got two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things sets of</font>

530
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:38,320
things to look at it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take you</font>

531
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,570
twice as long to troubleshoot that as

532
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,869
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were single stack if you've got</font>

533
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,908
a you're bgp session is down<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

534
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:49,029
once your sessions back up you probably

535
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:51,549
back up on both both families so again

536
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:53,769
do a ping<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 add in a ping maybe a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trace</font>

537
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:55,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">route and you probably are good so</font>

538
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:58,960
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of extra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost there</font>

539
00:19:55,029 --> 00:20:01,859
but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not huge data center</font>

540
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,100
again very much like adding a router or

541
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,770
other

542
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">equipe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the isp network is those</font>

543
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,440
apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be tested twice or maybe</font>

544
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:13,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">three times here's the hard part</font>

545
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,309
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your app and I got widely</font>

546
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,919
different answers from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the experts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

547
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:20,350
this field depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app either</font>

548
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,080
you're just using the standard libraries

549
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,959
you just updated your libraries and from

550
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,549
now on everything is is a breeze and you

551
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,970
just just being more throw in your

552
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:32,530
testing or you have separate code trains

553
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,049
and you're essentially building your app

554
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,850
twice depends on how low level your

555
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:37,990
application is if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> building it</font>

556
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:41,230
twice there's going to be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

557
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,210
work not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole thing but it could be</font>

558
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,549
as much as thirty percent additional

559
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,390
work to run dual stack compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

560
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,740
single stack again once you've got the

561
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,480
plan in place once you've got your test

562
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,679
automated you've got your load generator

563
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,539
whatever it is once the tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

564
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,630
underway the additional testing is

565
00:20:55,539 --> 00:21:00,730
probably incremental testing you know

566
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,990
your QA folks again same thing and again

567
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,000
there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

568

569
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,140
it's still probably moderately

570
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,240
incremental and I come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with pretty</font>

571

troubleshooting it's a data center

573
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,239

574
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,580
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of set of problems but</font>

575
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,320
generally once the physical problems

576
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,658
fixed once you've got connectivity layer

00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,678
probably ten percent additional work

both but once the plant exists repeating

605
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,049
capex on new security devices and I

606
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,149
don't know whether its capex or labor

607
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,100
for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring systems it depends</font>

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">on what you have and it may be as much</font>

609
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,908
as five or ten percent annually

610
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,449
potentially up to thirty percent

611
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:40,690
annually to operate dual stack now

612
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:42,490
that's I got to be clear here I'm not

613
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,940
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying it's thirty percent of</font>

your op x over your current effects that

615
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,850
that would be a little bit much because

616
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,710
there's an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of there's not a</font>

619
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,270
and those systems but for those things

620
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,629
we taught that I mentioned earlier the

621
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,679
costs are significant I mean not not

622
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,159
insurmountable but there's additional

623
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs there similarly for isps access</font>

624
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,720
router cpe those are the big things

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,190
access routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe ok cpe depends on</font>

626
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,830
what you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your time horizon is for</font>

627
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,419
the transition and then more<font color="#E5E5E5"> labor</font>

628
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,760
either integration or development for

629
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:20,020
your provisioning OSI systems and

630
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,320
similarly more money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to operate the</font>

631
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,049
network for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise network hey</font>

632
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,370
capex is cheap that's good but it's

633
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,539
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take you some extra hours maybe</font>

634
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:32,229
it's time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring in some consultants</font>

635
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:34,360
or just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know have some folks but put</font>

636
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,610
folks on it and plan for it for a slow

637
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,439
migration and the operating the

638
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:42,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">operations differential is fairly small</font>

639
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,990
now here's what I really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

640
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,350
to here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that I wanted to</font>

641
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:51,490
make which is these are additional costs

642
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:53,559
of dual stack over single stack now

643
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:58,450
right now pretty much everybody's single

644
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,710
stack on ipv4 probably a lot of networks

645
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,320
are going to be running dual stack for

646
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,179
some time but you get those that you get

647
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,010
this money<font color="#CCCCCC"> back you get to save this</font>

648
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:09,940
money when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go single stack type</font>

649
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:12,158
56 so how do you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point where</font>

650
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,110
you can single stack and realize some

651
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,730
savings again in the future and not have

652
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,740
to operate both these protocols at the

653
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,120
same time so that's what I really they

654
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,440
have really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

655
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,699
about how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

656
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,600
because there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some</font>

657
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,950
additional pain it's going to be a

658
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us for</font>

659
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,450
for some amount of time until we can

660
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually get to that point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

661
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,340
what I want to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you very much</font>

662
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,340
I'd love to entertain

00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brandon Ross network utility for us so</font>

664
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,600
is a two parts your presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

665
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,669
wanted to comment on a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and</font>

666
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,370
I'm speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly from we do a lot of</font>

667
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:53,650
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with small service providers so</font>

668
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:56,139
kind of your mom and pops that run

669
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,760
either a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis system or maybe</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Jeep on or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever else but there's</font>

671
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,550
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of these guys independent</font>

672
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:06,879
operators so so the access to your

673
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:11,230
problem for these guys is a major major

674
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost problem right yeah I agree with you</font>

675
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,550
that their backbones are generally

676
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">upgradable they're not usually running</font>

677
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">really ancient you know Netgear routers</font>

678
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,950
and their backbones most of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

679
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:25,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wisps might be but most of these</font>

680
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,580
established you know telco<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-op kind of</font>

681
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,260
guys they're mostly running relatively

682
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,350
recent gear the backbones but the but

683
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:36,730
the edge networks are a very big cost

684
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:38,230
problem for them so so to tie that<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

685
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,720
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should think about</font>

686
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,550
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree with is is what that looks</font>

687
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,530
like as you move to single stack but I

688
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,810
think there's a for some of these guys

689
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:50,320
an extended period of time when it's not

690
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:52,000
just dual stack but dual stack with the

691
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,740
transition technology to deal with the

692
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,070
fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their edge networks are not</font>

693
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,530
dual stack capable natively and probably

694
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,450
won't be still for quite some time

695
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,730
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> their upgrade cycles are going</font>

696
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:07,540
to be some of them fairly long because

697
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:09,670
of the very small margins in that part

698
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,320
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market so yeah I think that is a</font>

699
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,670
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that especially in</font>

700
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,980
rural areas where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

701
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:18,430
density of population buying a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

704
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,280
big deal for an ISP with a thousand or

705
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,860
ten thousand or twenty thousand users

706
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,899
that's a big deal six rd has been proven

707
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work by you know very large ISPs in</font>

708
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,120
the US so that's a viable potential

the cost right of the six rd technology

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,970
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone that size is probably</font>

714
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:49,220
also significant yes so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

715
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,289
an interesting comment at least to think

716
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,850
about that that it in some of these

717
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:54,919
styles and it works it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more</font>

718
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">expensive because they can't quite</font>

719
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,389
upgrade their edge but it would be

720
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think through what the</font>

723
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:08,238

724
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,369
like for large is p but yeah I mean

725
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:15,590
creeper<font color="#E5E5E5"> but interesting further thought</font>

726
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:17,480
yep yes chris griffiths comcast wondered

727
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:21,738
in the analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you did did you put</font>

728
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,019
any time into training in particular for

729
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:25,820
effects costs associated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

730
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,559
that's exactly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments that I said</font>

731
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">John George had made a comment and I</font>

734
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,559
training is potentially possibly might

735
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,119
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big deal it depends on how many</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who need to train and how dumb</font>

737
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:46,399
they are so it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on how you</font>

738
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,139
want to do your training so I think

739
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">there probably for most of us the folks</font>

740
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:51,649
in our network architecture engineering

741
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,600
groups they don't get training they read

742
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:55,100
manuals they read the documentation they

743
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,109
talk to the sales engineers maybe they

744
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,289
read an RFC and they break things they

745
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:02,269
fix it compared to a network operations

00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:09,019
picker those guys don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole lot</font>

749
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:10,639
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they need a lot more support</font>

751
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:14,238
far along in their careers so yeah they

752
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:16,129
do need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more support how much do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you get how do you do that I don't know</font>

757
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:30,049
are also lots of publicly available free

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually make that available and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

764
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,340
just make the junior engineers go

765
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,509
hunting for it if you have thoughts

766
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,629
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to model that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd love to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

them

768
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:57,179
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so uh my question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

769
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,030
have you given any thought to how these

770
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,400
costs change over time over year two

771
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:06,450
years five years you see them increasing

772
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:09,000
linearly decreasing<font color="#CCCCCC"> exponentially is the</font>

773
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,680
ones that I talked about saying gee

774
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,110
security appliances have only just

775
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,780
started adding features you might need

776
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,189
new appliances there that probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

777
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,540
costs go away in a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

778
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they're built into whatever</font>

779
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:25,430
you're buying next year the year after

780
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:27,540
the same is true with with cpe because

781
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,120
there's probably some amount of churn

782
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,560
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those costs are and those</font>

783
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,500
devices are getting replaced through

784
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,030
some natural cycle anyway so those costs

785
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,440
are generally reduced and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more time</font>

786
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,590
that goes by the more stuff we can

787
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,990
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> already has v6 built into it the</font>

788
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,720
point about small<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs then their access</font>

789
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,280
networks it there may be a longer cycle

790
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,460
there but yes absolutely the capital

791
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,830
costs are decreased over time the the

792
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,960
operational and development software

793
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,340
developing costs probably don't reduce

794
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,070
overtime because that work is going to

795
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done one way or another</font>

796
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:06,510
anyway at some point to attempt one more

797
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:09,240
David Barack AT&T what what what life

798
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:12,120
cycle time were you assuming for for the

799
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,360
non<font color="#E5E5E5"> belkin back backbone gear that</font>

800
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,060
because the the life cycle tends to be

801
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:22,949
pretty long and feature parity and v6

802
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:26,129
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 is less than ideal in in the in</font>

803
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:28,680
even even in core year so it depends

804
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:33,030
entirely on which features you're using

805
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:35,490
in your backbone for many of the largest

806
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,530
backbones and I can't speak for yours

807
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:41,460
but I can speak for<font color="#CCCCCC"> several that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

808
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:43,170
seen and heard from their right they

809
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,280
have been running ipv6 on their backbone

810
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:49,800
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years so now you may have some</font>

811
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">very clever advanced features running in</font>

812
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,210
your backbone and that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using</font>

813
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific features that drop out of the</font>

814
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,270
hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> path and you're doing you have</font>

815
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,649
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do software forwarding if you do v6</font>

816
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:03,389
bummer but so I don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid</font>

817
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:05,490
answer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's my rule of thumb has</font>

818
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,140
been if anything's less than

819
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,170
four or five years old it probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

820
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,640
speak v6 backbone stuff is even older

821
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,070
because those guys figured it out

822
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,179
earlier that today that answer your

823
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,439
question at all or<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aveda</font>

824
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,020
completely so you're assuming about

825
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:25,520
about a four-year cycle for most things

826
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:25,520
yes yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>
