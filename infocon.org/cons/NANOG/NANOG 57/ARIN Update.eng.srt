00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:12,990
okay thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 slides 20 25 minutes</font>

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,470
with questions it'll be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,180
these are statistics I don't can't do

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">much to make them exciting there's a</font>

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,410
little bit of interesting stuff when you

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,029
start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about transfers so i'm</font>

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,948
john curran president and CEO of iron

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,948
and this is the air an update

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like the next slide there we go</font>

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,589
hmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we still have ipv4 space people</font>

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,180
like that's a surprise to some people

12
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:47,339
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually asked me that aren't we</font>

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,170
out no we are not yet out but yes we're

14
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,869
getting there very quickly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to</font>

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,229
the iron web page and check it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

16
00:00:51,869 --> 00:01:00,210
on the front page presently it's a

17
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:02,129
two-point 60 / 8<font color="#CCCCCC"> equivalence so we are</font>

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,359
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the inventory I'll show</font>

19
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,580
you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requests that are leading</font>

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,350
us to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the inventory this is</font>

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">updated every morning I'm sorry every</font>

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,710
evening so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moves</font>

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,610
and then go to Erin and see how much

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:18,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">space is left okay ipv4 address space</font>

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,750
for quests now these are requests in

26
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:23,670
2012 for ipv4 both allocations and

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,350
assignments allocations for isps and

28
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,940
assignments ranges are these are

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,788
requests this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't represent the</font>

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,000
amount just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ticket coming in and you</font>

31
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:35,340
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it's pretty steady over the year</font>

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,810
it hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed significantly one way</font>

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">or another we're still getting requests</font>

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,610
and we're still processing them actual

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,200
space issue now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

36
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,840
interesting obviously when we issue

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,149
space as an allocation to an ISP they

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
get a lot more space than what ends up

39
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,840
if we issue space to an end users are

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,700
under an assignment request that's why

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,250
these bars are predominantly dark blue

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,140
not light blue and you can see that

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're still issuing space we still</font>

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,759
occasionally get very large requests

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,259
these bars<font color="#E5E5E5"> are calibrated it says</font>

46
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,098
requests on the side but it's really

47
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,410
number of / 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> equivalents and the</font>

48
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:15,209
numbers are actually below so for

49
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:19,709
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> in May of this 2012 you can see</font>

50
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,900
we issued 27,000 equivalent of 27,000 /

51
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,970
20<font color="#E5E5E5"> Falls of space so we are going</font>

52
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">through space some ISPs are coming back</font>

53
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,010
with very large requests we will run out

54
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,010
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to predict when because</font>

55
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,170
one large bar is more significant than

56
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other six months on either side of</font>

57
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,530
it so very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to predict as mr.</font>

58
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,969
Houston has elaborated on in the past

59
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:46,409
ipv6 same thing just<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower numbers as</font>

60
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,790
was pointed out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the prior</font>

61
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,189
presentation we have a lot

62
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,290
people in the region using v4 we have an

63
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:55,590
ever-increasing number but still a

64
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,870
relatively small ratio so we receive

65
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,359
requests from ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end-users for v4</font>

66
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,939
they're fairly steady we did see a

67
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,700
little bit of push leading up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> June</font>

68
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:08,700
of last year people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

69
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,488
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the world ipv6 events the</font>

70
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,888
world ipv6 launch day and we've actually

71
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,540
seen even<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that after it dropped</font>

72
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:19,409
back down we've seen a steady stream of

73
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,239
increases in ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users but it's</font>

74
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,000
a very you can see it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

75
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">line of increase we don't expect to see</font>

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
any surge we expect as people get around

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,739
to doing v6 for them to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

their<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests in terms of the this was</font>

79
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,590
maybe clear this was allocation requests

80
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,169
and allocations made so the requests to

81
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,700
us or in dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue and what we issued or</font>

82
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,859
requests that we approved were in light

blue this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the same thing</font>

84
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">for assignments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users and you can</font>

see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as i said the steady trend</font>

86
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,019
we've seen a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of increase in</font>

87
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,000
end user requests for v6 after<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of this year and we are</font>

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,599
issuing more very slowly increasing

90
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,209
there was a big surge prior to world

91
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,339
ipv6 day it dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> off but now it's</font>

92
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,750
increasing again but increasing is

93
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:19,530
linear at best<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not even geometric</font>

94
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay ipv4 address transfer market so</font>

95
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,380
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting we have ipv4 space</font>

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,280
available ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and end users can request</font>

97
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin under NR p.m. and receive space we</font>

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,210
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a transfer policy which allows</font>

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,760
a party to transfer space to a party

100
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">that needs it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there'd</font>

101
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a lot of transfers because you still</font>

102
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that you have to pay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone for</font>

103
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,030
that that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> often significantly</font>

104
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,400
more for just requesting space from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin</font>

105
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,739
having said that we still see transfer

106
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,780
is going on even before we've run out in

107
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,479
the region seeing transfers for two

108
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,429
reasons first one bankruptcy related one

109
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,770
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> any goes bankrupt it wants to value</font>

110
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,419
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has put a price tag</font>

111
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,320
on every bit of it move it out the door

112
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">and does all</font>

113
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,570
off so we see transfers as people get

114
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,030
that valuation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lodge underutilized</font>

115
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:14,610
blocks some folks have woken up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

116
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:16,919
wow I have 65,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> address addresses from</font>

117
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,430
my community college of 600 people I

118
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,200
might have some unused space or I have

millions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> address i have 16 million</font>

121
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,920
ever using more than 200,000 some of the

organizations that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large</font>

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,940
particularly classful assignments are

124
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,320
now showing up and saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've arranged</font>

125
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,660
to break it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and transfer to other</font>

126
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,060
parties so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are seeing transfers</font>

127
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,030
they're all reported on the Iron website

128
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">on to show on the screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here more</font>

recent development is inter<font color="#CCCCCC"> AR AR</font>

130
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,550
transfers I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that and also</font>

they're available at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that URL every day</font>

134
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,040
these you can go look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the whois</font>

135
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:02,130
record and see who they ended up with if

136
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,770
you put in a request to receive an

137
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,330
address block from another party we

138
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,830
actually contact the other party no

other one we make sure the request is

141
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,849
valid we say yes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time but</font>

142
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,440
we say no sometimes and people get upset

143
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,550
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say no so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell you</font>

144
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,610
in advance why we say no why do we turn

145
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,140
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> your request if you try to transfer</font>

address space to a party<font color="#CCCCCC"> that isn't</font>

147
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,490
actually going to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they don't have</font>

148
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,230
a need then on NGOs or operator that can

149
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,250
explain under the current policies how

150
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,170
they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the address space</font>

151
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,580
then we deny them I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> upset you</font>

152
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,380
know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> come to us very upset they</font>

153
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,539
say John I'm very upset I I don't

154
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,760
understand why I don't understand what

155
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,440
Aaron's role is here Aaron's role is to

156
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,120
enforce the policies that you folks set

157
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,700
and those policy say it goes to parties

158
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,260
would need so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can move around rough</font>

159
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,120
space particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you folks who are</font>

00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,720
you'll find it doesn't work well request

163
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,300
the transfer blocks by other than the

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,980
actual registrant yes we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

not mine oh that's cute that won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

167
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,330
and and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> this comes into a</font>

168
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,590
number of discussions of what is

169
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:18,359
registered to you and what isn't

170
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:22,210
people do splits mergers acquisitions

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,970
and don't document all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the details</font>

leaving us some number of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> later to</font>

stare at the asset purchase agreement

176
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,740
great time with this gives us something

177

to do but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

178
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,740
to make sure that the party that's

179
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,600
actually transferring the block is the

180
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,010
one that's the correct registrar if you

try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer a block and you're not</font>

you make sure it's in your name request

191
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,050
the transfer block sizes smaller than

policy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> AP nick is a policy which</font>

212
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,650
actually is corresponding to that when

our eyes have corresponding<font color="#E5E5E5"> into re</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thing only to another region we've had</font>

216

six blocks all transfer to AP Nick those

217
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,900
are the dates of the transfers in the

218
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,250
block we've actually had parties inquire

219
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,680
about transferring the other direction

220
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,420
which I find interesting I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font>

221
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,729
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of address space in AP Nick</font>

222
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,229
but occasionally occasionally there's

223
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,820
blocks there that aren't being used and

224
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's parties here who might want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's can go either direction</font>

226
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:23,200
but we've seen six go in that direction

227
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,810
transfer facilitators there are people

228
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,280
who are good at finding people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who need</font>

229
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,018
address blocks and are willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay</font>

230
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,610
from

231
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,230
there are people good at finding address

232
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,029
blocks that are underutilized who are

233
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,970
willing to liberate them for money this

234
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:37,439
is not Aaron's job they total extent to

235
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,449
which we're willing to get involved here

236
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:41,849
is to keep a list of them so we know

237
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:44,819
where they are we could tag them with

238
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">RFID</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zor biochips but they didn't stand</font>

239
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:47,998
for that we have a list of them though

240
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:50,099
so we know where they are they all agree

241
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:51,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comply with errands policies you can</font>

00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:49,329
here and talk about up somebody I wanted

287
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask you about a rumor I heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm her</font>

288
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:56,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody asked us suggested that the NSF</font>

289
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,410
said that you can you don't have to pay

290
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:00,970
any attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Aaron and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said that</font>

291
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,889
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sound right to me but I know who</font>

292
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that's actually a great</font>

293
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:08,769
thing to race so prior to Aaron's

294
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,449
formation there was a cooperative

295
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,149
agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> called the internet for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

296
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:15,099
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you old like me you remember that it</font>

297
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,230
included the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> management and</font>

298
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain name addresses actually</font>

299
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,379
originally included information services

300
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,029
and it was done by a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

301
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:24,509
eventually ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up being done</font>

302
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:28,179
predominantly by network solutions and

303
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:30,369
in 1997 there was a decision that that

304
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:32,889
would move out of the internet contract

305
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:35,079
and would be done by a community-based

306
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">association just as it's done and ripen</font>

307
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:40,508
a v-neck so we formed Aaron the NSF said

308
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,609
you now should continue with this

309
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:45,220
function go forth an issue IP addresses

310
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:48,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've been information since</font>

311
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:53,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">December 97 so someone wrote the NSF and</font>

312
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:54,639
asked I don't know whether my rights can

313
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,959
be affected by Aaron I was issued

314
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,790
addresses under your cooperative

315
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,979
agreement and how does Aaron apply and

316
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,529
the NSF general counsel wrote back and

317
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,059
said we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really see how anyone can</font>

318
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:08,319
affect your right to issue addresses so

319
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:10,299
you know can't consult your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> attorney</font>

320
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:12,009
but we don't see how this could affect

321
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:14,769
you your rights could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be affected after</font>

322
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:18,819
the fact that was issued<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cup get some</font>

323
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:21,459
press so on and so forth subsequent to

324
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:23,110
that I wrote a letter to NSF it's

325
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:25,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually on the Aaron website under the</font>

326
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,160
legacy agreement if you go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FAQ at</font>

327
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,319
the bottom you'll see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the links to</font>

328
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,649
all this and we pointed out that the

329
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:35,889
statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work for the internet</font>

330
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:39,549
contract specifically referenced in RFC

331
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:41,109
1174 which said everything done under

332
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:45,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet contract shall be subject</font>

333
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:47,079
to this RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and subsequent rfcs that</font>

334
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:49,929
might be published from time to time by

335
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:52,419
the IETF well so if it turns out that

336
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that statement of work said that and was</font>

337
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:58,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of overlooked by some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

338
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:01,750
the subsequent<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfcs like RFC 2050 are</font>

339
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:03,850
applicable and in fact RFC 2050 was

340
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,130
adopted before Aaron was even around and

341
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,870
in fact when it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopted it said it</font>

342
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,270
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a statement of how the intern Nick</font>

343
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,670
issued address space not how Aaron ish

344
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,660
address space and it actually changed

345
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,000
the rights of everyone who had been

346
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">issued address space prior so this is</font>

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">all explained it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also another little</font>

348
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,000
detail I guess which was important which

349
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,310
was that it's not the NSF's job at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

350
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">point to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Department</font>

353
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:36,069
are the lead agencies and this was all

354
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:37,660
pointed out to the NSF and the NSF came

355
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,450
back with a letter which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also online</font>

356
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:43,240
that said yeah not our job we're sorry

<font color="#E5E5E5">commerce and the Department of Commerce</font>

359
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:52,210
actually issued in December a statement

360
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:54,250
on internet numbering principles which

361
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,080
says they believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

362
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,950
transparent bottom-up multi-stakeholder

processes they support the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR system</font>

364
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,940
and they support Aaron and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policies</font>

365
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,340
and procedures that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out of Aaron</font>

366

00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:21,220
been amended by NSF and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA pretty</font>

370
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:25,240
much had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to step in and they sent out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

371
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:28,420
very clear clarification it's at this

372
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,130
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we've said before if your IP</font>

there in the air and database the

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,850
policies that you guys set apply to all

376
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:42,699
those addresses long answer thank you

377

379
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,479
that it's great that you're talking

380

<font color="#CCCCCC">about all this ipv6 adopt a shin and one</font>

381
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,820
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's interesting to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is as I'm</font>

382
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,689
planning rolling it out to many sites in

383
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:04,270
ipv4 the minimum allocation is like a /

384
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:05,920
24<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ipv6 / 48 and yet I'm hearing as</font>

385
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,120
I'm planning out building<font color="#CCCCCC"> out my cities</font>

386
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,650
I need to

387

blocks of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain size so that I can</font>

388
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,449
traffic engineer what is the minimum

389
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,579
size as a consensus from all of the

390
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,320
operators that you're aware of that they

391
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,720
will accept advertisements from because

392
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,920
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been hearing that certain providers</font>

393
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:27,130
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Verizon will only accept</font>

394
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,599
advertisements / 32 or larger I was

395
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering if you were aware of anything</font>

396
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,260
along those lines or if there's a

397
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,970
consensus and then if anybody disagrees

398
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,970
with what you say feel free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

399
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">and comment truck so I can tell you all</font>

400
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,700
about what address space you can get

401
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,650
from Mariners and NGOs or an ISP and and

402
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,270
users are pretty simple is be a little

403
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,010
more complicated we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about number</font>

404
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,290
of serving sites and the size of each

405
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,660
serving site and actually a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

406
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,069
desk right outside that door has some

407
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,430
very good people who will help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

408
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:00,190
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron doesn't actually set</font>

409
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,920
policy on road filters that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

410
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:07,300
each operators practice and that's a

411
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,569
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing not our job so I have there's</font>

412
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,470
no consensus that I'm aware of on

413
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,780
announcements or announcement filtering

414
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,660
I do know that because end users were

415
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,849
receiving / 48 many many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> except</font>

416
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,079
flash 48 for end users because you could

417
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,389
get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user coming to you who</font>

418
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,178
already has a prefix but for isps

419
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,690
there's no convention to my knowledge

420
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:30,460
that's a open the best practices in that

421
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,260
area or an open question and something

422
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this room could discuss at some</font>

423
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,330
point but not something set by iron

424
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,650
great I was sort of leading into that if

425
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody wants to say that they have</font>

426
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:45,250
anything that they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a filter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

427
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:47,110
a must be bigger than / 48 I love to

428
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:52,500

misunderstanding so no it's hard real so

441
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,169
let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're talking about here</font>

442
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,270
there is a relying party<font color="#E5E5E5"> relying party</font>

445
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,429
our trust anchor link which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

446
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,789
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to sort of decode</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or our</font>

447

actually click to acknowledge this

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,590
relying party agreement and it says

450
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,639
you're going to decode the information

451
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,230
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use it you're going to</font>

452
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,260

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,100
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to share the data with</font>

out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there somewhere ok we amended the</font>

464
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,299
agreement the moment it was brought to

465
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,049
our attention that this would produce

466
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,908
this might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way of doing</font>

467
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:26,010
reporting and statistics in summary

468
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:27,210
however it's still applicable with

469
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,220
respect to redistributing the

470
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,159
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason for that is</font>

471
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,200
because a lot of parties need to make

472
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure they understand the liability</font>

473
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,230
they're accepting if they process rpki

474
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,970
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they build a filter list</font>

475
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,100
in real time and share it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with someone</font>

476
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,110
else the party at the other end needs to

477
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,990
understand the constraints on the whole

478
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,490
system and so we actually we do not

479
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,350
allow redistribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd like them to</font>

480
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,700
go get the trust anchor and acknowledge

481
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,510
the agreement and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would solve the</font>

482
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,909
problem so the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that came up</font>

483
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:03,929
just recently was a presentation and the

484
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:05,820
security track the other day<font color="#E5E5E5"> where about</font>

00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:10,440
some extensions<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea to do some</font>

486
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:12,360
extensions in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl to put some state</font>

487
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,970

488
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,340
the route object in the sky so and I've

489
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:21,059
actually heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work so the thing</font>

490
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:23,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think about is at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

491
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:27,629
a party that does that regeneration of

492
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,970
information is in a sort of high

493
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,390
liability situation if they generate

494
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,279
things incorrectly they as consequences

495
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,929
if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

496
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,460
that there are their agreement with

497
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:39,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron gets in the way and they want to</font>

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">set up a commercial service to do this I</font>

499
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:44,178
am happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the discussion and as</font>

500
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:46,879
long as they understand the implications

501
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of indemnifying us accepting the</font>

502
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:51,468
liability of redistributing then we can

503
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,969
figure out a way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make that work but I</font>

504
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:54,710
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually talk to someone who's</font>

505
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:57,739
legally responsible for the company and

506
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">not someone doing a click acknowledgment</font>

507
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,559
on our website so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think you</font>

508
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,629
actually have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service that's in the</font>

509
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,119
way come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in contact me the one or two</font>

510
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,918
people who have have after they talk to

00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,830
their legal teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone screaming into</font>

512
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,599
the night so but if you've got one come

513
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,559
talk to me I'm happy to change it we

514
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure the company</font>

515
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,529
knowledge is what they're doing so if it

516
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:19,909
so if it were an irr operator that they

517

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're happy to</font>

about field two filters on prefix length

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do not believe this as you said</font>

529
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:50,419
there's that there is a consensus on

530
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,099
appropriate length it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

531
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:53,629
outstanding question for best current

operating practice and if only there

533
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,089
were hey wait there is a forum where

534
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,869
those sorts of things might be discussed

535
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:02,599
bring it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay last question</font>

academic institutions and other folks

541
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,129
where the folks running it may not be

542
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:21,919
tied high enough up in the organization

543
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,478
to actually accept liability and that

544
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,330
org may not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care on its own</font>

545
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:29,479
enough to accept the liability these

546
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:32,449
seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's key in the way of cool</font>

547
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:35,960
operational reality the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF framework</font>

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:39,080
for rpki 4p kicks certificates I said

549
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:42,080
states that the party where<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

550
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,089
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the CP and CPS are not</font>

551
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,649
inherently binding agreements and that

552
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:47,409
they should review the responsibilities

553
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:48,639
and implications and

554
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,170
it's intentionally not a legal agreement

555
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,940
that would be something that they would

556
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,400
accept as a relying party agreement

557
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,640
we're complying with the framework that

558
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,410
was set up by the IETF ok so if

559
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,330
someone's actually making use of this

560
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,370
data and isn't aware of the risks for

561
