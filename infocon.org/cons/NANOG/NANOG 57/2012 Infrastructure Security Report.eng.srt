00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:07,440
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2012 infrastructure security</font>

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,849
report presented by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arbor we've seen</font>

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,700
this report before it's usually really

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:13,440
good I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce Gary sock</font>

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,599
rider from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arbor who's a solutions</font>

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,599
architect thanks

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:33,240

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,450
this is a 96-page document if you're

00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the survey and helped us pull this</font>

18
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,670
information together this is our eighth

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,360
annual and we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward to continuing</font>

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,699
the tradition so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump right</font>

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">in with some key findings from the</font>

22
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,350
survey as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overview I</font>

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,009
can't get through 96 page document here

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,320
today I'd be up here all all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> long so</font>

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,370
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I wanted to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,130
we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through these in a little bit</font>

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,409
more detail so first of all advanced

28
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,240
persistent threats apts sure you guys

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,820
are familiar with this concept been

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,229
around for a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time something</font>

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,039
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we saw this year in the</font>

32
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,860
survey was a keen interest from service

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,790
providers in apts traditionally we see

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,770
this more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an enterprise threat</font>

35
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,670
hearing service providers concern about

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">apts is something new and definitely</font>

37
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,899
interesting I think this revolves around

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,670
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple things certainly it's also its</font>

39
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,619
threats within their own network but

40
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,350
also customer concerns and demands next

41
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:57,630
detox<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks sizes we track this year</font>

42
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">over year we have multiple sources for</font>

43
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,750
tracking this but this is specifically

44
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,880
what we hear from our survey respondents

45
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:09,060
the sizes of plateaued really we've seen

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,930
a largest tax starting in twenty ten was

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,660
about 100 gigabits<font color="#E5E5E5"> per second since then</font>

48
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,960
we've seen a drop off in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the respondents</font>

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,490
telling us a last two years running<font color="#CCCCCC"> 60</font>

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,160
gigabit per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a maximum attack</font>

51
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,900
size but we got some additional data

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,730
i'll go through talk about that as well

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,890
and then of course we're seeing a trend

54
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:33,239
toward more complex and multi-vector

55
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,559
attacks no surprise there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,970
better we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> at defending this stuff</font>

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,379
the better they get it coming up with

58
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:43,709
new ways to attack right data centers

59
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:45,750
again some pretty alarming numbers here

60
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,420
ninety-four percent of data centers are

61
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,819
seeing regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS attacks that's a</font>

62
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,929
really high number got some a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

63
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,940
of insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> into why that's happening</font>

64
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,150
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that in detail as well</font>

65
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then ideology again this year is a</font>

66
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,080
primary driver for ddos<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure if</font>

67
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,390
you've been watching in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news you've</font>

68
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,409
seen a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of this stuff in the press</font>

69
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:10,069
right you know always<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing anonymous</font>

70
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:14,159
the financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks the motivation</font>

71
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:17,940
reported to be the video<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the YouTube</font>

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:21,209
offensive to Muslims so ideology a major

73
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,680
driver again this year a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> more key</font>

74
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,430
findings I want to go through we'll get

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the details mobile providers</font>

76
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,739
continue to have challenges and

77
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,599
defending their network securing the

78
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:37,620
network's majority still don't have good

79
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,540
visibility into the core there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,060
of economics driving this we'll talk

81
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,579
about that in detail as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well DNS</font>

82
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,400
infrastructure remains vulnerable this

83
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,860
one I'll just give a caveat we're pretty

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,750
tough on DNS and the reason is it's such

85
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,170
a critical piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure right</font>

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,790
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not only a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ver neural vulnerable</font>

87
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,409
as an infrastructure but it can also be

88
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,540
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an attack vector itself so it's</font>

89
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,578
it's something that if you when you look

90
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,959
at the numbers you'll see that DNS is

91
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,849
probably more secure than most the other

92
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,590
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we look at but we're still</font>

93
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:14,760
hard on it because we know it's so

94
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,430
critical ipv6 as I'm sure you're all

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">aware deployments are really</font>

96
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,010
accelerating eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

97
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,820
respondents tell us they've already

98
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:26,760
deployed or will by the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

99
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,909
no surprise considering that majority

100
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,159
vast majority of respondents<font color="#CCCCCC"> or service</font>

101
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,040
providers carrier's network operators

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,660
and then lastly a few bullet points

103
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,650
around operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and law</font>

104
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:43,139
enforcement as usual we're hearing that

105
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of incidents go unreported and</font>

106
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,660
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> good reasons for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we'll</font>

107
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about that as well</font>

108
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so let's talk about apts first</font>

109
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,919
as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said this is this is something</font>

110
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,810
that's that's been around for a while

111
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I sorry for the eye chart I don't</font>

112
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,710
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can read all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers</font>

113
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,479
here but they said you can you can pull

114
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,930
down the survey yourself and get all the

115
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,900
details what we see a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we</font>

116
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,080
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> botted compromised host we see a lot</font>

117
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the experience of apts in the</font>

118
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,430
networks themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's we've</font>

119
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,310
asked people what they've seen in their

120
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,040
networks over the last 12 months we're

121
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,950
seeing that on the carrier networks as

122
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,430
well as their their corporate networks

123
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:30,469
we also are hearing a greater concern so

124
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,419
even though we're seeing these threats

125
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,550
we're hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more concern</font>

126
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what these threats</font>

127
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,100
are going to be in the future so like I

128
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,990
said before in the enterprise that's not

129
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,400
so surprising it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little surprising</font>

130
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,940
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to hear such a high level of</font>

131
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,940
concern over apts in carrier networks

132
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D das threat again is top of mind</font>

133
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,280
share you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top five threats</font>

134
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,280
seen the last 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> months all related</font>

135
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,929
around denial service we asked people

136
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,619
about looking forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the next 12</font>

137
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,960
months again top four concerns so you

138
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,780
know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a clear trend we saw very</font>

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,669
similar results last year but it tells

140
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,210
us that the threat persists it hasn't

141
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:20,240
gone away one really interesting piece

142
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,130
of data we pulled out here is Miss

143
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,620
configuration so when we asked people

144
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,020
about threats and concerns are things

145
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,190
they've seen it caused problems in the

146
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,560
last year the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss configuration is very</font>

147
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,760
high on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so a lot of</font>

148
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,050
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are seeing problems due to miss</font>

149
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,680
configuration when we asked them about

150
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,700
what they're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future</font>

151
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,220
misconfigurations comes in pretty low

152
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,659
right well it's interesting if it's

153
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,310
something you're seeing a lot of it why

154
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,830
are you less concerned about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

155
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,440
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while and what</font>

156
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,200
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is pretty simple right I'm a lot</font>

157
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">more worried about somebody you know</font>

158
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,640
stealing something from me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I am a</font>

159
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,840
worried about myself losing it right my

own<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes I mean I just</font>

161
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,179
live with right so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

162
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">human nature we we know that this exists</font>

163

164
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,690

165
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:16,910
threats from the outside we're much more

166
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:19,250
defensive about all right large<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS</font>

167
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:23,389
attacks i mentioned before we'd seen a

168
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:25,250
plateau and in 2010 about 100 gigabits

169
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,990
per second last<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years the highest</font>

170
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,199
recorded attack was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 gigabits per</font>

171
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,360
second we took this and remember this is

172
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're hearing this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what people</font>

173
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">are telling us so we took that and we</font>

174
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,790
compared it with our own data are our

175
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,679
Atlas database and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that</font>

176
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,810
we have available will receive real

177
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,610
threats in the wild and what we've seen

178
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,950
for three years running is a consistent

179
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,310
plateau right about 100 gigabits per

180
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,560
second for the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks what that</font>

181
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,840
tells<font color="#CCCCCC"> me is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've they've hit the</font>

182
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,820
ceiling as far as they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

183
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,150
generate larger attacks if they if they

184
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,979
did they would but it takes a lot of

185
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,260
effort and resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate 100</font>

186
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:04,909
gigabit per second attack and so there's

187
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,389
really no reason for attackers to push

188
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,190
beyond 100 gigabit per second until they

189
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:13,130
feel the need<font color="#CCCCCC"> right to be successful in</font>

190
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:16,880
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeptah seeeeee another cause for</font>

191
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,979
this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the the trend</font>

192
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,169
toward the more application layer

193
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:24,139
stealth attacks that are you know going

194
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:27,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be not as volumetric right much much</font>

195
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:31,700
smaller and a flying under the radar so

196
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:33,620
talk a little bit about that that's the

197
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,229
Atlas data that I mentioned so you can

198
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,260
see the peaks there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little over 100</font>

199
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">gig another peak there about 80 gigabits</font>

200
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,360
per second and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

201
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,850
average attack size is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

202
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,680
straight trajectory pretty much well

203
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,589
over a gigabit per second now I'd say

204
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:56,270
averaging closer to gig and a half per

205
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:58,610
second so clear trends really really

206
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">obvious stuff this corroborates what we</font>

207
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:05,000
see already in the report<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we see in</font>

208
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:07,610
our own research so application layer

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,310
and multi-vector attacks number one

210
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,260
attack vector HTTP no surprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

211
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,270
right as more and more applications and

212
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,420
services are moving

213
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,340
to web then of course that's where the

214
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,099
attacks are going to come right so we

215
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,260
see HTTP and DNS or number one and

216
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,650
number two targets the application layer

217
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:30,150
and then we're seeing a rise now and

218
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,709
encrypted attacks or SSL<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS attacks</font>

219
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,380
that is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually</font>

220
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,540
growing pretty fast so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still a</font>

221
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,710
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> percentage of the overall attack</font>

222
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:44,110
traffic you know we see something like

223
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:47,860
thirty seven percent of respondents told

224
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,680
us they saw encrypted tracks attacks

225
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,410
when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our at our own database</font>

226
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,020
in our and where we track<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time</font>

227
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,390
threats in the wild it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

228
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,530
point four or five percent of attack

229
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:04,260
traffic is in port 443 so what that

230
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:08,110
tells me is people are seeing it right

231
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:11,650
but it does it's it's it's a small part

232
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:14,380
of a much larger blended threat so be

233
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,000
interested to you know hear from some of

234
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that haven't taken the survey what</font>

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,020
you're seeing but that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

236
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">trend is going to continue were going to</font>

237
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,630
see more encrypted attacks in the future

238
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,550
as far as the multi-vector the blended

239
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,220
attacks everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure has heard</font>

240
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,349
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacks on US financial</font>

241
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,540
institutions it's a great example of

242
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about that in a little</font>

243
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,170
bit more detail so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably heard a</font>

244
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,840
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this I won't spend a lot of</font>

245
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,310
time on it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know talk a</font>

246
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,460
little bit about what they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font>

247
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:48,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">we saw so these attacks were using</font>

248
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,040
compromised servers if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read about</font>

249
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already a little bit different than</font>

250
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,760
what you expect with traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS</font>

251
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,350
attack kind of i call it back to the

252
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">future right i keep maybe gonna put a</font>

253
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,230
delorean on this slide but the

254
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,400
originally DDoS attacks were using

255
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,320
servers because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing</font>

256
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,970
that had enough bandwidth to generate

257
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,130
these volumetric attacks right so

258
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,230
nobody's using compromised you know home

259
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:15,970
pcs it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't generate the large</font>

260
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:18,970
attacks that trend died off years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

261
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,280
and people went to much more widely

262
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,560
distributed botnets maybe you know tens

263
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,030
of thousands of of compromised hosts

264
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,829
being used to generate volumetric

265
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,209
attacks

266
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:31,630
these attacks kind of went back old

267
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,490
school and use compromised servers so

268
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,700
they could generate large attacks with

269
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:39,760
very small numbers of hosts so these

270
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:44,790
were you know common web servers running

271
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:47,439
PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress Joomla you know unpatched</font>

272
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,199
you know not well maintained servers

273
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,430
that were you know compromised

274
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,400
applications were compromised and then

275
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,949
they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to control these without</font>

276
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">establishing a traditional command and</font>

277
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,200
control network so that made for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

278
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,860
nimble ability to rapidly change attack

279
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,420
vectors the the tax themselves were

280
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,970
really nothing earth-shattering nothing

281
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:13,589
unexpected getting post

282

284
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:24,069

285
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP syn floods ping floods right so</font>

286
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,720
again nothing earth-shattering about

287
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,630
what they used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that</font>

288

they attack but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> combination of using</font>

and nimble ability to change attack

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,230
vector so we'd see attacks begin

293
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,150
countermeasures deployed right attack

294
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,089
traffic is dropped and then almost

295
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,100
immediately after a countermeasure is

296
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,810
effectively deployed attack vectors

297
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,050
would change so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meant that they</font>

298
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,160
were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused they were using</font>

299
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,650
monitoring tools they were they knew

300
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,540
what was happening I knew when the

301
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,150
countermeasures were effective when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

302
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,390
attacks were defended<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very rapidly</font>

303
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:13,180
changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> gears to you know hit another</font>

304
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:16,839
vector another port another application

305
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:21,099
and you know maintain the attack keep

306
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:23,529
the site's down very high bandwidth and

307
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,270
packet rates from single sources again

308
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:26,680
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

309
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,319
compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers sitting in data</font>

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,739
centers high bandwidth high-powered

311
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,510
machines right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it just showed a lot</font>

312
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,709
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence in the way they put all</font>

313
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,089
this stuff together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how they were</font>

314
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,498
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

315
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,999
maintain it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course as you</font>

316
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:43,069
know these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone on for</font>

317
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:45,170
months there now you know taking a break

318
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:48,589
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to last</font>

319
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:51,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">personal link will see there's you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

320
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:55,189
the purported motivation is videos that

321
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:56,809
are still out there but anyway I we

322
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:58,339
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really we're not really in the</font>

323
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:03,529
game<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attribution right we'll leave</font>

324
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:06,739
that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to law enforcement all right so</font>

325
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:10,609
look at the overall attack targets we

326
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:13,459
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that customers are the vast majority</font>

327
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:15,679
of the target so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> again a sort of</font>

328
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,209
a shift right what we had seen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

329
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,358
past was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of infrastructure</font>

330
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:24,439
targeted in the carriers and network

331
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:26,720
operators the that infrastructure really

332
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:29,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">today has largely been protected right</font>

333
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,089
so teams have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a great job of</font>

334
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,859
protecting it making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not</font>

335
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,589
vulnerable that their networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font>

336
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:38,929
to stay up<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then what happens is you</font>

337
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:42,040
know okay it's it's a transit network

338
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:45,529
right so the tax come in the

339
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,998
infrastructure is secure so they're

340
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:48,439
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to target something that's not and</font>

341
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:51,769
that's something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not is the</font>

342
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:53,959
customer so no surprise that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

343
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:56,540
vast majority of respondents tell us

344
00:14:53,959 --> 00:15:00,258
that customers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most common</font>

345
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,849
target when we asked about what types of

346
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:03,549
customers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being targeted this was</font>

347
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of interesting right so you'd think</font>

348
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:07,189
been reading the news and you hear about

349
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:09,379
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks being attacked and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

350
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,959
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know financials and you</font>

351
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:13,610
hereby government being attacked

352
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,069
Anonymous has taken on the government in

353
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,350
multiple areas this year in the past

354
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:20,509
year it turns out that those are

355
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,509
actually much lower like fifth and sixth

356
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:24,980
place so the primary targets are still

357
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:30,199
where the money is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right its e-commerce</font>

358
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:32,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">its business so it's I think there's a</font>

359
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,219
little bit of a disconnect and what you

360
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,018
see in the media versus what's happening

361
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,809
in reality and I think there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

362
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:41,629
reasons for that when it's you know

363
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:43,429
something that's highly public you know

364
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,019
financial services are highly regulated

365
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:46,970
they have to report this stuff they

366
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:49,740
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide it everybody notices</font>

367
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:53,050
when their bank website goes down right

368
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,480
but when it's an attack on you know a

369
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,740
business for financial gain they don't

370
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">really wanted to slow that information</font>

371
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,380
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

372
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,540
have to so it doesn't tend to make as

373
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:07,840
much of a splash in the news so we don't

374
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:10,810
hear about it data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center we're seeing a</font>

375
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,420
huge increase in attacks in the data

376
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,089
center again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> surprising to</font>

377
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">me if you you know you if you talk to</font>

378
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,610
anybody you know with a seat beginning

379
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,330
of their title or now I shouldn't pick

380
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,040
on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our executives but actually if you</font>

381
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,830
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you just talked about anybody</font>

382
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's wants to talk about technology</font>

383
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,520
these days you can't have a conversation

384
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,080
without the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud popping out a</font>

385
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,970
hundred thousand times right so

386
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,050
everything's cloud cloud cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

387
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that really mean that means putting</font>

388
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,530
stuff in data centers right well when we

389
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,310
move things to the data center and this

390
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:47,079
whole cloud strategy there's some pretty

391
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,780
clear economic drivers around that that

392
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,790
say it's about shared infrastructure

393
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,920
it's about time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> market it's about</font>

394
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,050
reducing costs you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't hear a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

395
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">people say it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about improving security</font>

396
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,329
right so security<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud tends to</font>

397
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,969
be you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last thing we think</font>

398
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,610
about and it's and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not I'm not</font>

399
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,020
picking on data center operators you

400
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,280
know it's it's the enterprises that are

401
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,250
hosting their applications in the cloud

402
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,109
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not planning for security but rather</font>

403
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,390
just trying to focus on getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

404
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:19,958
down right so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a huge</font>

405
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,940
increase in DDoS attacks impacting the

406
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,230
data center no no surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> there when</font>

407
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:28,240
you look at the dynamics of it so

408
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,250
mitigation there we see some

409
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,440
improvements still some areas for

410
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,120
concern and increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the use of DDoS</font>

411
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,930
mitigation systems in the data center is

412
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,959
a good thing decrease in black holing of

413
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,520
traffic that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so it seems</font>

414
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">like there's some focus on maintaining</font>

415
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,780
serviceability we know that there's an

416
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,510
impact and there's a there's a cost to

417
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,100
this the one thing that surprises we saw

418
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,720
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big increase in the use of firewalls</font>

419
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,050
in the data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ddos mitigation</font>

420
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,590
which you know even next-generation

421
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,210
firewalls have

422
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,559
you know some vulnerabilities

423
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,960
vulnerabilities when it comes to DDoS

424
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,149
attacks right state exhaustion tax can

425
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:12,090
can pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> elys easily overwhelm these</font>

426
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:14,600
devices we asked about motivations I

427
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,230
talked a little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this before</font>

428
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,139
people tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

429
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:23,070
motivations are ideological right it's

430
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,740
personal beliefs driving this stuff we

431
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,408
do see you know motivate a tax motivated

432
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,809
by extortion right I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

433
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,510
advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> persistent threats people are</font>

434
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:37,049
using DDoS as a smokescreen for you know

435
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:40,200
data exfiltration for financial gain for

436
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,330

439
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,220
thing we know is the more motivations to

440
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,720
do this the higher the risk is going to

and you know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not the focus</font>

466
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,890
or they just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the resources or</font>

467
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:04,380
the demand really from their customer

468
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:06,059
base to be as focused on security so

469
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,390
what we find is they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have great</font>

470
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:10,980
visibility into their traffic when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

471
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,720
ask them<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're seeing threats and</font>

472
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,580
attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

473
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,289
no I don't see I don't see any threats

474
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,000
and attacks and then we asked them what

475
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,908
they see and how they see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and the</font>

476
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,850
answer is oh well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't I don't see</font>

477
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:26,299
much of anything so it's a lack of

478
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:28,620
visibility in the in the networks and so

479
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,270
that's a problem right if you can't see

480
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:35,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attacks you can't do anything about</font>

481
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:37,668
them we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked people about you know how</font>

482
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:40,530
they're doing it what they're using

483
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:43,049
often it's they're just using sis logs

484
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,570
from vendor equipment it not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

485
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:48,629
necessarily security equipment when they

486
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,970
do employ security it's it's most

487
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,039
commonly firewalls again that's a that's

488
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:56,220
a challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> right from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS</font>

489
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,408
perspective you can see here you know

490
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">well over half don't even know if they</font>

491
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:05,190
have compromised subscribers or end

492
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:08,100
devices on their on their networks so

493
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:11,490
again it's it's a definitely an area for

494
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:15,090
concern dns<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned this right up</font>

495

front we're hard on it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

496
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:22,500
operators are doing a pretty good job on

497
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:24,330
the whole you know it's funny whoa we

498
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,730
call out here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to pick on our</font>

499
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:30,570
own slides here but you know nineteen

500
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:32,220
percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS operators have no</font>

501
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,260
dedicated security team responsible

502
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,260
solely for DNS I mean think about that

503
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,440
we're expecting a dedicated security

504
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,270
team for one application right the fact

505
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,730
that eighty-one percent do have

506
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:48,240
dedicated security teams just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for DNS</font>

507
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,820
that's awesome that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

508
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,590
we pick on it i mean it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

509
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,260
because it's so critical right we know

510
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,030
it that is that there are still some

511
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,620
vulnerabilities they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> three quarters</font>

512
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,250
have good visibility at layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and</font>

513
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,750
four that's fantastic news but only

514
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,320
about a quarter have visibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> leisa</font>

515
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">layer 7 which could lead to missing some</font>

516
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:15,178
potential attack vectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right ipv6</font>

517
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:19,440
rollout<font color="#CCCCCC"> i touched on this earlier you</font>

518
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:22,039
guys know this well I'm sure one things

519
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,290
that we worry about with ipv6 though is

520
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,030
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

521
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,980
and about you know this exponential

522
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,590
increase in the number of IP addresses

523
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,840
right so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the favorite tools in</font>

524
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,540
the toolbox for you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopping be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">toast axis is blacklisting known bad</font>

526
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,920
actors right known bad addresses command

527
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,550
and control botnets stuff like that

528
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:46,580
right well when you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got just insane</font>

529
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,230
number of IP addresses you can't black

530
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,360
list everything right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it's just</font>

531
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,950
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> too many to even think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about using</font>

532
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,080
black<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists right there's just too many</font>

533
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoints out there and then of course</font>

534
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we ask people how they're deploying</font>

535
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,390
ipv6 the most common answer is dual

536
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:04,160
stack right and this opens up potential

537
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:07,310
vulnerabilities as well so there's a lot

538
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,070
of security to be worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ipv6</font>

539
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:12,409
networks we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know there are</font>

540
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">some security mechanisms inherent in</font>

541
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:18,230
ipv6 but we also know that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

542
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:21,110
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical vendor deployments the</font>

543
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,450
security in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their ipv6 tax is not at</font>

544
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,550
parity with ipv4 right and that's true

545
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,590
pretty much across the board so as these

546
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:32,149
networks roll out there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

547
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:37,389
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the future the growth</font>

548
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:40,850
is obviously continuing you know we saw

549
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,320
you know half of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> respondents say</font>

550
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:46,820
they expect that that growth to continue

551
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,290
about twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent the next year you</font>

552
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">know some of them tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us they see more</font>

553
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,800
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred percent growth not</font>

554
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,290
surprising when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at regions</font>

555
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,030
other regions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asiapac</font>

556
00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:01,659
where they're already out of ipv4 space

557
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:04,160
and rapidly growing number of endpoints

558
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:09,850
threats and concerns really pretty

559
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,850
similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what we see in the ipv4 space</font>

560
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,780
certainly you know that there's a

561
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:18,470
concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said around the feature</font>

562
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:21,010
parity and equipment visibility has

563
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,620
actually dropped and that's a concern

564
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:27,200
you know don't exactly know all the

565
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,510
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that certainly miss</font>

566
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,670
configuration is an issue here as well

567
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this more or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less mirrors what we see</font>

568
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:38,410
in ipv4 operational security I'll touch

569
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,409
on real quick

570
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,490
about a quarter said they have no

571
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:46,100
dedicated security resources and this is

572
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually an increase over last year this</font>

573
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,029
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most surprising things</font>

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I saw is that organizations</font>

577
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:02,210

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> economy right we look kind of he's</font>

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,720
several years now<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and resources</font>

581
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,090
are just tight right and good qualified

582
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,940
security people are hard to find and and

583
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,570
to keep and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an area</font>

584
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:24,350
that's dropped off a bit unfortunately

585
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:26,960
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked people about why they cite op X</font>

586
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:29,029
and capex reasons right so it's just

587
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,799
lack of resources I think the economy is

588
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:32,629
tightened everything up and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

589
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,580
having a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard time maintaining the</font>

590
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:40,100
investment in security talk about attack

591
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,240
and defense readiness about half of the

592
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:47,959
respondents told us they never practice

593
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,370
incident handling that's not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I but</font>

594
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,470
it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than last year</font>

595
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,279
believe it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so it's an improvement</font>

596
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:57,470
but it's still only about only<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

597
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,909
half what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

598
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,740
you you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at again I'll</font>

599
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:03,679
reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to these financial</font>

600
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:05,509
attacks if you figure that half the

601
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defending these hadn't been</font>

602
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:11,809
running drills going through practicing

603
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,669
preparedness with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> teams well I can</font>

604
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,769
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that after you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3-4 months</font>

605
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:18,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">of continuous attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there well</font>

606
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:21,259
practice now very well practice now so

607
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really want to be practicing</font>

608
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,740
on the job in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sense you're going to</font>

609
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,350
be much better able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defend and if you</font>

610
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,539
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> again at the trend in that back in</font>

611
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,908
September when the attack started sites

612
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:34,879
were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and staying down by</font>

613
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:37,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">December January sites were staying up</font>

614
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:42,918
under attack right teams were practicing

615
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:44,809
it got really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at it talk about law</font>

616
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,480
enforcement real quick more than half<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

617
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:49,129
respondents<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not refer security</font>

618
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,890
incidents to law enforcement there's a

619
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:52,120
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reasons around this when we</font>

620
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,430
them they<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know tell us different</font>

621
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,139
things they don't think the law

622
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,600
enforcement will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything or you know</font>

623
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,770
it's against company policy or maybe

624
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,179
it's just lack of time and resources

625
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,340
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to me a couple things</font>

626
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,200
here is they believe you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

627
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,730
strong response saying that they believe

628
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,500
that the government has a positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> role</font>

629
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,330
to play but then when we asked them if

630
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,510
government is doing enough or if they're

631
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:19,120
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good job the majority say no so</font>

632
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,520
it's kind of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting response</font>

633
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,120
there we think they should they can but

634
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,780
they don't and then lastly when we talk

635
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,010
about why people don't refer incidents

636
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,860
talked to a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people about this</font>

637
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,450
and its really pretty straightforward

638
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,870
after the first time you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font>

639
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,840
realize what an incredible resource

640
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:42,610
drain it is it you know engaging law

641
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,159
enforcement or government and an

642
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,469
incident really puts a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> burden on an</font>

643
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,870
organization and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are shy about</font>

644
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,940
doing it once they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done it because if</font>

645
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the resources if you're</font>

646
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,670
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as we heard them you know the</font>

647
00:27:54,010 --> 00:28:00,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">last metrics people are security teams</font>

648
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:02,830
are shrinking right then they're really

649
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,149
reticent to turn it over and get law

650
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:09,100
enforcement involved increase that

651
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:10,260
burden<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right some bad at a time I</font>

652
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,199
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you some quick</font>

653
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:18,670
demographics here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really got a pretty</font>

654
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:22,090
good swath for this survey we get people

655
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:24,370
from around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> globe about two-thirds</font>

656
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our respondents or hands on people</font>

657
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:30,159
you know network operators security

658
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,830
engineers analyst architects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

659
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:38,740
close to thirty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> are management</font>

660
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:42,909
executives we asked you know what types

661
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,340
of organizations these responses are

662
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:48,300
coming from you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see it comes across</font>

663
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,800
the board but<font color="#CCCCCC"> 75% is service providers</font>

664
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:55,240
and then the rest would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be government</font>

665
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:57,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">education enterprise etc survey is a</font>

666
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,520
one-year survey but it starts it runs

667
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,260
from sep tember to october so it's not

668
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,790
calendar year so if any any of the

669
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,480
statistics<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't making sense to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

670
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're thinking</font>

671
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,110
that I saw this in 2012 well you might

672
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">have seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it after October when we</font>

673
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:15,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">closed out the survey 130 unique</font>

674
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,040
respondent organizations so we weed out

675
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,750
duplicates we weed out people that

676
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,700
started and then didn't finish the

677
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,590
survey but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to anyone</font>

678
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,690
here that did take our survey and

679
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:29,790
encourage anyone that hasn't to please

680
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:32,679
participate in the future and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then last</font>

681
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:35,309
we asked what sorts of services their

682
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:39,040
respondents are running and you can see

683
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:40,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good news is organizations are</font>

684
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,340
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of the networks and</font>

685
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,979
offering lots of services on top of them

686
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,799
most respondents are running multiple

687
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,460
services everything from from dns to

688
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:55,840
hosting in fact hosting was the top spot

689
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:58,240
hosting and Kolo services so you know so

690
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> services being offered of</font>

691
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,840
course the more services you're offering

692
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,429
the more applications and the more

693
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,199
vulnerabilities more infrastructure

694
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:11,790
right so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it I'm right</font>

695
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,990
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think thank you so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much and</font>

696
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:19,168
get some more coffee it's early<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

697
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font>
