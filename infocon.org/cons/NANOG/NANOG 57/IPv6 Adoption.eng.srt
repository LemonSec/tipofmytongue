talk about ipv6 adoption

6
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:57,159
surprised to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see so many of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

11
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:06,350
going to interject some things that

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">perhaps you won't see on some of these</font>

26
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:46,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">last night so the real motivation behind</font>

27
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:50,780
the work that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were looking at here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

28
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,849
to try to understand at a very very high

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,149
level a course level would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

30
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:57,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on with ipv6 adoption so what are</font>

31
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things that sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of struck us as we</font>

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,060
sort of looked at this problem was that

33
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,310
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were lots and lots of data out</font>

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,560
there and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of metrics about</font>

35
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">how close or how far we were along the</font>

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,370
path to ipv6 adoption and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes</font>

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,040
with multiple orders of magnitude

38
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,680
difference between the numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,510
being reported so the real approach here

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,730
was to go back and step back in the

41
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,109
process of adoption look for some coarse

42
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,209
grain metrics the things that we thought

43
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,730
were most important in terms of

44
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,230
reflecting where we are as a community

45
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,670
moving towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new protocol and do</font>

46
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,640
some measurement do some comparisons

47
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,018
across the different protocols so what

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,129
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a variety of</font>

49
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">different data sets that we had an</font>

50
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,599
opportunity to use basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data</font>

51
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:44,480
is recent through the beginning of q4

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,640
and 2012 so towards the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last year</font>

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,010
we are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets</font>

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,029
that precede that time period but we're

55
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,399
again in trying to do some longitudinal

56
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,069
studies and again up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> about October</font>

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,170
of last year some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

58
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,739

of its ipv6 client adoption data arbor

65

68

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,350
an entire day and we did some of our own

<font color="#E5E5E5">our analysis here today so the first</font>

77
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:54,140
metric that we looked at was this ipv4

78
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,940
and ipv6 prefix allocation so the

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,029
numbers here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the number of prefixes</font>

80
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:02,960
that we see allocated per month in both

81
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,760
v4 and v6 when we back as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

82
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,820
data was publicly available for us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

83
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,010
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at and we see time</font>

along the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a linear scale</font>

86
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,730

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,140
log and linear scale from time to time

to paint on the size of the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

89
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're trying to take a look at some of</font>

90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,900
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see throughout</font>

91
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,130
all the metrics that we have and it's

92
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,109
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious I think to everybody in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at least at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the current</font>

96
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,010
be towards the top here although one

97
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,260
thing that you'll notice is that the

98
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,240
slope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the v6 lines are always going</font>

99
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,710
to be much deeper than the slope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

100
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,720
v4 lines will talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about</font>

101
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,039
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means long term for adoption</font>

102
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,810
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the first metric that we're</font>

103
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at here again the total of</font>

104
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,370
prefixes allocated per month you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

105
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,490
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of interesting activity</font>

106
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,770
around the 2011 this is you know all

107
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that activity around ianus exhaustion</font>

108
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,000
event and then the subsequent you no

109
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:06,440
rars kicking off last allocation

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,520
policies the next metric we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

111
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,490
took a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a look at</font>

112
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,680
was this ipv4 and ipv6 a prefix

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">advertised</font>

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,009
this is actually going now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and looking</font>

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,199
at the route<font color="#CCCCCC"> used data and asking of</font>

116
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,639
those allocated prefixes what are those

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,090
prefixes are actually being allocated

118
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,470
out in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing table here you see a</font>

119
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,479
huge difference again now we switch to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

actual prefixes that are being announced

122
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:36,469
some small blips again around 2011 or in

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,930
part because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the flurry of</font>

124
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,910
allocation activity around then in part

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,710
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflecting one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2i PP o--</font>

launch events that were that were run

127
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:52,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">will delve down a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deeper in</font>

128
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,930
some of those in<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a minute another</font>

129
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,889
metric that we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and took a look at</font>

130
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:03,349
was the fraction of traffic that was a

131
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,570
native<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus tunnel door encapsulated</font>

132
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:09,169
so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have two different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lines</font>

133
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,909
looking at this metric we have the data

134
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about from google again</font>

that's the the darker line on the bottom

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,800
had flow enabled to report this v6

153
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,799

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,799
to have graph this would have been to

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,199
look at the increase in native versus

cases so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google we see the numbers</font>

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,210
approaching near zero<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arbor we see still</font>

here another

164
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:30,469
metric then we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

165
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">this idea of the naming infrastructure</font>

166
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:35,869
so what we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

167
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:39,049
longitudinal analysis of the zone files

168
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:42,769
and we're simply performing a you know

169
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:45,948
counting the quad a and a records for

170
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:49,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">for common net over time and so we see</font>

171
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:52,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">this sort of upward trend perhaps a</font>

172
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:57,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more steeply in the net</font>

174
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:05,748
records in both of those zones so then

175
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,099
what we did is we took that trace

176
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:09,169
because of course it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

177
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:11,149
to know that that they know there's a

took<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one day trace which is several</font>

196
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,649
resolve something there's actually a

00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,989
resolver in the traditional sense of

198
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:01,610
resolver so we looked at the subset of

199
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things which were active resolvers</font>

200
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,600
and we asked the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what</font>

201
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,680
fraction of the resolvers that were out

202
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,319
there and either<font color="#CCCCCC"> when these populations</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually queering verisign for cuate</font>

206
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,000

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,490
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in at least some of that</font>

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,309
naming information and we see numbers

209
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,470
where at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost ninety percent of</font>

210
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:26,269
that more active resolvers the ones that

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,720
we actually trust to be real resolvers

212
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:34,129
resolving on behalf of clients making

213
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,870
those kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of queries this is one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">those ones it to be little bit difficult</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to see from</font>

216
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:44,930
from the back what we did was looked at

217
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:46,459
a the in that packet trace we looked for

218
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,888
what names were actually being queried

219
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:53,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then we compare those to what</font>

220
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:55,250
was being queried in ipv4 and gave some

221
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:57,139
reference in terms of you know where

222
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:01,160
they fell<font color="#CCCCCC"> on something like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alexia</font>

00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:02,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">tap n so one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font>

224
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,910
is interesting to note is this third

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rank order in the top you</font>

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,300

there by like number 10 you're looking

235
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,920

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,779
different set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are being</font>

240
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,410
if you can't see as many of the items

prevalence in that same trace we just

252
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,490
drilled down briefly and looked at what

253
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:23,959
the record query distribution was here

not an order of magnitude difference now

305
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:53,720
we go turn back to the ipv6 and ipv4

thought was

<font color="#E5E5E5">Christine to go ahead and look at from</font>

some of those measurements was to sort

<font color="#E5E5E5">of look at that data longitudinally and</font>

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,970
because of course the networks are

417
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,710
growing there's demands for addresses

418
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,420
there's demands for a new prefixes as

419

things grow you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether or</font>

426
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,260
these are fractions that again is the

427
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,270
idea that the ipv4 lines are on top of

428
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,710
the v6 lines in spite of the fact that

429
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">one's growing faster than the other</font>

430
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">before still dominates this sort of</font>

431
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:15,110
makes sense metric number one on the top

432
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:20,600
is the the allocation data metric to is

433
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:23,959
the routing data metric seven here is

434
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:30,340
the DNS data<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten is the is the traffic</font>

435
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:32,300
data I think for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the glue records I</font>

436
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,070
forgot to update that<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide before I</font>

437
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,780
looked at it so a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

438
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,210
that are interesting here all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

439
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a positive upward trend so if you</font>

440
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,380
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the growth in in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> networks</font>

441
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,570
by doing the comparison between<font color="#E5E5E5"> four and</font>

442
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,400
five everything is positively upward

443
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,480
trending so across every single one of

444
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,640
these metrics whether it's the

445
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,310
allocations or the routing or the DNS

446
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,140
infrastructure or the client readiness

447
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">six is out growth and six is outpacing</font>

448
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,710
growth in for another really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

449
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,290
interesting thing about this particular

450
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,880
graph is that kind of makes sense to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

451
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,490
right so notice that you know although

452
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,890
the metrics can<font color="#E5E5E5"> vary by several orders</font>

453
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,840
of magnitude depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

454
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:13,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the elephant the philosopher is looking</font>

455
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,439
at right they all sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fall in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

456
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,060
order that makes at least make some sort

457
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,060
of natural sense to me it<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense</font>

458
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adoption the allocation is</font>

459
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,600
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> precede the routing is going to</font>

460
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,190
proceed you know getting your naming a

461
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,139
line is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to precede the actual</font>

462
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,910
traffic itself so that seems to make

463
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,790
some sense it seems to give some idea

464
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,930
for why we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of see these disparate</font>

465
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,909
numbers being floated around it really

466
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:38,770
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what part of this broad</font>

467
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,770
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> your part of</font>

468
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,440
not a huge fan of projections because I

469
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they hardly ever come true but we</font>

470
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,260
did do some curve fitting for both the

471
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:53,120
most the top of that set of lines which

472
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,520
is the allocation and the bottom set of

473
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,439
deadlines which are I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're the</font>

474
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,670
glue records in DNS so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of least</font>

475
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,490
prepared versus the most prepared in

476
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,230
those slides the left hand side you see

477
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">some double marking your triple</font>

478
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,040
marketing that's the historic trend data

479
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,840
up at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and then you see two</font>

480
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,850
lines coming off of each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

481
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,310
sets of lines one is an exponential fit

482
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:21,080
and one is a more polynomial fit of the

483
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,870
curves that we saw identified on the

484
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">left-hand side bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line here is you</font>

485
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,590
know again try to choosing those

486
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,330
bounding ranges that in the next three

487
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:32,480
or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years if these predictions hold</font>

488
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:37,100
and we'll see you know upwards of twenty

489
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,800
percent of the of the allocations being

490
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:45,429
v6 and we'll see upwards of one or two

491
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:50,810
percent of the DNS traffic bb6 as well

492
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:52,580
oops so that's sort of the question that

493
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sort of analysis that we wanted to</font>

494
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,060
do again our<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal here wasn't</font>

495
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,160
necessarily to drill down deeply in any

496
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of those metrics I didn't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

497
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,760
through talking about what region was

498
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,500
growing faster than other regions other

499
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,210
folks had done that what I really wanted

500
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,310
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> was make a comparison across the</font>

501
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,660
metrics and try to see why it was the

502
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,490
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know depending on who</font>

503
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're asking we're almost there or</font>

504
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:16,730
we're really really really far away so

505
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the great some time for questions yeah</font>

506
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely are there questions looks</font>

507
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,950
like John has a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> does Mike work</font>

508
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,690
now just Mike work yes oh my god i guess

509
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:30,500
i should say welcome back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to nanog after</font>

510
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:33,220
someone extended hiatus um so you're a

511
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:36,890
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes from you open the podium the</font>

512
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:39,040
the questions that you answered<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what</font>

513
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,030
and how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> were useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess I had a</font>

514
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,920
question or a comment if you don't have

515
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:46,370
the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the who it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

516
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,020
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what</font>

517
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,699
the changes are from who we're getting

518
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,889
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> occasions</font>

519
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,750
if they were being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used so looking at</font>

520
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:56,209
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> allocations and then if</font>

521
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,039
they're being announced and then perhaps

522
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,840
being inserted into zone files or

523
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,919
actually getting queries from that space

524
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,459
to you say anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about trends and or</font>

525
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,320
can you identify ISPs that are

526
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,200
experiencing some of the growth and ipv6

527
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,059
is or anything to see there yeah so we

528
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,500
didn't certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> go down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP</font>

529
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,899
level they like<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreed that's a very</font>

530
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,370
interesting question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again I won't</font>

531
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:20,840
go through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the metrics because I</font>

532
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's that question is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

533
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">be different depending on which of the</font>

534
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:28,309
metrics you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do recall</font>

535
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:31,909
the data from the allocation in terms of

536
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:34,580
absolute numbers a ripe and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap Nick are</font>

537
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:37,519
1 in 2 in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the allocations</font>

538
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,110
followed by Aaron followed by and I

539
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,010
can't remember tweet lack Nick and hath

540
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:46,449
neck in terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ratio however of v6</font>

541
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:49,250
to be for that list is inverted so it's

542
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:52,159
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> snit hit laughs Nick we have a</font>

543
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:55,610
much larger percentage of their

544
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,130
allocated prefixes in v6 than air and

545
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's is way towards the bottom of that</font>

546
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,679
list in terms of the actual fracturing

547
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,570
so that's one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember from</font>

548
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:03,919
allocation certainly would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

549
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,590
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drill down with them and</font>

550
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:10,130
the other metrics as well and just

551
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,689
reminder to two things as you ask

552
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,600
questions to state your name and

553
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,549
affiliation and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak directly into</font>

554
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,559
the microphone so everyone can hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

555
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:20,860
that was John<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christoph of team comer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> e</font>

556
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,240
by the way who asked the first question

557
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">Warren kamari Google and I'm actually</font>

558
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,740
told enough to speak into the mic for

559
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,279
once can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide that</font>

560
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:39,110
had the breakdown of ports and protocols

561
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:43,309
I think so yes the application makes

562
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:45,529
yeah so 14.1 percent was neither<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp nor</font>

563
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:49,418
UDP that seems higher than<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would have</font>

564
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:52,370
expected did you look what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that uh</font>

565
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:55,159
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can have a scotch I'm in</font>

566
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,989
since he gave us the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually in v4 as opposed to be six</font>

568
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:02,130
right so my guess is that there's a

569
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:04,140
bunch of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know giri and other kind</font>

570
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,840
of traffic in there but you know Scott

571
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,150
you know the mix better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do yeah</font>

572
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,330
Scott<font color="#CCCCCC"> ikol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Johnson arbor networks yeah</font>

573
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:15,630
the other the total other<font color="#E5E5E5"> is partly data</font>

574
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,730
collection we only added the other break

575
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,320
out by protocol in a later version of

576
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,670
our software so some deployments running

577
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,800
older versions aren't differentiating

578
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">tcp versus UDP so they kind of just get</font>

579
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,700
lumped together into unknown or other

580
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,690
and then there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some non</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP UDP</font>

581
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,690
protocol traffic

582
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,240
any other questions

583
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,879
okay thank you
