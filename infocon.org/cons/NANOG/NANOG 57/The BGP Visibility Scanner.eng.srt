00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,050
coming up to speak about the bgp

visibility scanner

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,000
hi everybody my name is anthem I'm a PhD

00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,250
Madrid I'm a newcomer this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my first</font>

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,720
nano meeting some please bear with me

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,489
today I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be talking about a</font>

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,790
cool tool that we have been developing

11
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:45,669
it's called the BGP disability scanner

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,980
by we I mean myself my PhD advisor

13

16
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,870
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how this tool can help you as</font>

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,390
network operators and what you can do

18
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,730
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and how cool it is I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about why we have thought about it</font>

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the first place so in very simple</font>

21
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,950
words the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is a network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:15,610
networks and the BGP is the glue that

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,470
holds<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything together so networks</font>

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,659
kind of exchange which ability

25
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,360
information they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to define pads</font>

26
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:26,440
and ultimately send traffic which is the

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,600
main point but networks also want to

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,140
achieve not only operational goals but

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,759
also economic and political goals so<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp</font>

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,160
conveniently allows them to define

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,450
routing policies and to define their

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,130
preferences in traffic routing but due

33
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that these are not publicly</font>

34
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,710
available in not everybody knows what

35
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,420
each other is doing only by configuring

36
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,679
a routing policy are never sure that

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> achieving what you wanted to</font>

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,780
achieve and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only human and</font>

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,259
mistake is human so mistakes do happen

40
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you are never sure that you are</font>

41
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:04,810
doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right thing so we believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

42
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,169
operators need to not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor their</font>

43
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,848
own network and be very sure of what

44
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,250
they were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but also they need an</font>

45
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:15,609
outside view they need as many external

46
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,379
use as possible so that's what we are

47
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,560
doing with our tool we are providing

48
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:23,709
network operators with an external view

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,720
on their operations we are focusing on

50
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,819
prefix visibility as an expression of

51
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy interaction of stable policy</font>

52
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:33,369
interaction and we are mostly defined

53
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:34,730
today like the most important concept

54
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,739
we're going to be talking about today

55
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,349
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be hearing this a lot is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the limited visibility prefix it's been</font>

57
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,980
proven<font color="#CCCCCC"> that not only not all the</font>

58
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:46,459

subset of prefixes that are not present

62
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">in all the full routing tables or what</font>

63
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,989
you can understand of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> flooring table</font>

64
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:00,040
given that such a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a default</font>

65
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,569
free zone does not exist contrariwise we

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,370
define also the high visibility prefixes

67
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,619
which kind of make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in all the routing</font>

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:26,569
together we look at about 24 collection

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:29,150
points in total there are about 140

75

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,900
this something that the operator

behind all the data manipulation i'm

going to show you the methodology to

have it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear and out in the open</font>

based on a study case or you're going to

93
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,660
take like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a natural sample and i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

originating as a network and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

104
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,940
tool is kind of available three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

105
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,460
now so we have been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

106
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,750

108
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,230
to you and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you what</font>

109
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,940
happened there

110
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,610
s'alright the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PGP visibility scanner</font>

111
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,440
just like any data analysis process we

112
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,930
have three main steps we gather the data

113
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,390
we clean it and then we processes to get

114
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,230
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want first step we gather the</font>

115
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:06,289
raw data from ripe and reviews we just

116
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,630
randomly<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen to sampling times at 8am</font>

117
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 4pm it every day of course this</font>

118
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:15,890
can be changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can we can work with</font>

119
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:19,099
as many snapshots as we would like then

120
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,260
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to searching in this raw data</font>

121
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual data that we are interested</font>

122
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:27,230
in that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could further use for our</font>

123
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,990
processing so we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> this finding the</font>

124
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:33,020
global routing tables now if you think

125
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,390
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the raw data there we have been</font>

126
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,010
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify three types of feeds we</font>

127
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,830
have the partial feeds so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

128
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,880
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like customer to provide</font>

129
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,669
their figures of your kind of

130
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,830
relationships this would be maybe a feed

131
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,260
that appear would provide to another

132
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,599
peer then we have the full routing

133
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,330
tables or the global routing tables or

134
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,520
something that a fee a routing feed that

135
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,130
a provider would inject to a customer

136
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,549
requesting of<font color="#CCCCCC"> corroding fee and the</font>

137
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:04,550
third type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of routing feed is the global</font>

138
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,510
routing table + + 1 like internal routes

139
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:12,200
that are not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest for our</font>

140
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:14,480
for our analysis so the first filter

141
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,570
that we apply is the size filter and we

142
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,830
do not we discard every routing fee that

143
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:23,330
has less than 400,000 prefixes this is

144
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">very straightforward this is very simple</font>

145
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,440
you just check how many routing feeds

146
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,540
are in a kind of a global routing table

147
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,790
400,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we discard everything so</font>

148
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,790
we're left with full routing tables and

149
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">following tables plus internal routes</font>

150
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,710
then well the monitor is kind of

151
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,840
sometimes give more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one running</font>

152
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,909
feet to the collectors and we checked

153
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,099
what's inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> that route if you'll be</font>

154
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,660
seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are no differences so we</font>

155
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,840
kind of discarded over the picketing or

156
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,150
not to have false positives and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

157
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,830
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we have our full routing</font>

158
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,780
tables or global routing tables and all

159
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">over all ending this plus internal</font>

160
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,109
routes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we start looking inside</font>

161
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,930
the routing tables and it's

162
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,000
are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that we do not</font>

163
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,470
want like Balkans Martians information

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,370
we cannot really process at this moment

165
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,810
like multiple originating prefixes so

166
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,590
just to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a few numbers if we</font>

167
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:18,930
take 25 October last year we were in the

168
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,049
raw data we had like 500 different

169
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,900
routing tables we applied all the

170
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,720
filters we were left with 130 global

171
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,210
routing tables after eliminating the

172
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Balkans we were we were discarded 500</font>

173
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,000
prefixes out of the whole Union and the

174
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">most were about four hundred thousand</font>

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,940
five hundred so just to have a quick

176
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:44,340
idea now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we merge all the information</font>

177
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,860
from this 130 global routing tables

178
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,440
together and we checked like the simple

179
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,690
cdf of in how many routing tables do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

180
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,780
see how many prefixes so this would be

181
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the upper plot you see there that on the</font>

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">x-axis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the number of routing</font>

tables in<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the axis you have the</font>

184
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,650
probability of finding a number of

185
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,419
prefixes in at least extruding tables so

186
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,460
you see a clear separation between the

187
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,250
prefixes that are not making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the</font>

188
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">older to all the routing tables and the</font>

189
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:16,260
prefixes that are everywhere and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

190
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,450
break this down by prefix length so you

191
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,789
kind of like see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the color code</font>

192
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,310
from cold so not kind of not making it

193
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,750
everywhere too hot red making it

194
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:30,060
everywhere you see that this is not a

195
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:33,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that is characteristic only two</font>

196
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,309
I don't know prefix length longer than /

197
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,030
24 s for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see this</font>

198
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,890
problem kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everywhere so having</font>

199
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,659
decided that preface<font color="#E5E5E5"> visibility</font>

200
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,490
something of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the question</font>

201
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these prefixes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

202
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,160
not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it everywhere how many are</font>

203
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:53,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">there so we're starting our actual</font>

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,100
processing step by putting labels to all

205
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,510
the prefixes you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

206
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,980
sampling times we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a limited</font>

207
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,600
visibility label and a high visibility

208
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:06,810
label according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our previous</font>

209
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:08,280
definitions right so first we look at in

210
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,650
how many routing tables can we actually

211
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,160
see a prefix that's called the

212
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,990
visibility degree and

213
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,509
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> after checking the visibility</font>

214
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,040
degree for all the prefixes we discard

215
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:20,720
the ones that are present in only<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire</font>

216
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,550
routing table with a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat length of</font>

217
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,529
one so basically the ones that for which

218
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">we only have information that they are</font>

219
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,579
present in the originating is<font color="#CCCCCC"> these we</font>

220
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,069
tagged as internal roads and discard

221
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:33,319
them then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the actual</font>

222
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:35,029
labeling mechanism it's very straight

223
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:37,459
for it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple we apply a</font>

224
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,649
ninety-five percent minimum visibility

225
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:41,540
threshold whatever is below this

226
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,980
threshold is labeled as limited

227
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,170
visibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether it is above this</font>

228
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,930
threshold is it's labeled as high

229
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,040
visibility very simple at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

230
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:54,638
step we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

231
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:58,759
prefixes tagged with at most two labels

232
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">now the question is to remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

233
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,389
transit prefix is the ones that are just

234
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">emerging the ones that are not an</font>

235
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:10,189
expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stable routing policies</font>

236
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:13,459
and we do this by developing this

237
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:16,069
labeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevalence Eve we're saying</font>

238
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:18,170
that a high visibility label is always

239
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:20,259
prevalent so if a prefix have made it at

240
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,870
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> point everywhere then it it's</font>

241
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:26,060
forever tagged as high visibility and

242
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,490
then we tagged as limited visibility

243
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,469
only the prefixes with<font color="#CCCCCC"> too limited</font>

244
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,880
visibility labels according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our two</font>

245
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:38,029
moments moments of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sampling so if we go</font>

246
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,730
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our our sampling case from the</font>

247
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:44,540
23rd of<font color="#E5E5E5"> October we kind of see that we</font>

248
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,639
discarded 7800 prefixes that were tagged

249
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,099
as trends it's only had one labeling

250
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,829
that label was limited visibility so

251
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,449
overall we got about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500,000 prefixes</font>

252
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:54,888
twenty percent of them had limited

253
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:59,719
visibility eighty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them had</font>

254
00:10:54,889 --> 00:11:01,630
high visibility so now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

255
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,600
are the rich ability issues for this

256
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:08,059
limited visibility prefixes so what we

257
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,870
did is look for for each of the limited

258
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:13,819
visibility prefixes we looked for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

259
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,009
covering high visibility prefix and what

260
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:17,990
we found is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some limited</font>

261
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,629
visibility prefixes that do not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

262
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:23,920
covering high visibility prefix those

263
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:27,700
are marked dark prefixes so our

264
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">once they're in our example in like the</font>

265
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,100
sampling example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 23rd of October we</font>

266
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:36,279
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify about 2400 of</font>

267
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,870
these prefixes it's very interesting to

268
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,329
actually find these prefixes because

269
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,699
they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prefect there may be</font>

270
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:45,430
prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have that may have reach</font>

271
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:49,410
ability issues in the in the lack of a

272
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:53,199
default route so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that we have</font>

273
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,579
defined our three main sets of prefixes

274
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:56,019
the limited visibility the high

275
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:58,870
visibility and the dark prefixes and

276
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:01,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody can wake up now and pay</font>

277
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention to the characteristics of</font>

278
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:07,089
these prefixes first first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the</font>

279
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:10,209
distribution on on prefix length we see

280
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:12,130
that the high visibility there are no /

281
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,859
more specific 10 / 24 in the high

282
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,139
visibility this tells us that filtering

283
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,880
or lack of filtering can be one

284
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:21,639
explanation for<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we have limited</font>

285
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,189
visibility prefixes and that goes for

286
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">the dark ones as well also we check the</font>

287
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:29,350
ice path length and we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of see</font>

288
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,569
like here that the dark the limited

289
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,350
visibility prefixes are very much skewed

290
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,579
to the left so definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are not</font>

291
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,070
random subset of the high visibility

292
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:43,719
prefixes this is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

293
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:47,199
around originating is the mode therefore

294
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,920
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> distribution is to and that kind</font>

295
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:52,269
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like locates the problem now it's</font>

296
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,110
very important to understand we're only

297
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:58,060
sampling the networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are active in</font>

298
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,130
those two projects and it's very

299
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,779
important to understand how the sampling

300
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">affects the number of limited visibility</font>

301
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:07,089
prefixes we discovered and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

302
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,209
we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here just the distribution of</font>

303
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:12,730
prefixes on number of monitors that

304
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:16,899
contain those prefixes within their

305
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,390
routing tables with yellow you have the

306
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:22,120
hard disability prefixes with blue

307
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,620
purple I mean the limited visibility

308
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,079
prefix we kind of see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

309
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,930
gathered towards the extremes the

310
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,589
extreme parts of the plot this means

311
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:34,899
that as we add more monitors to to our

312
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:36,840
sampling process then the chances are

313
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:40,500
that we will discover

314
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,700
more limited visibility prefixes if you

315
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,440
want this could be a measure of the

316
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,760
complexity of the internet it's very

317
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">very simple and straightforward</font>

318
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,100
questions how many prefixes are out

319
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,330
there in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet also it's very</font>

320
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting here to note that the 95th</font>

321
00:13:53,330 --> 00:14:01,430
minimum threshold that we imposed

322
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:03,839
previous previously it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

323
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,520
stable value so we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it we</font>

324
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,740
can shift it but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not very</font>

325
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,939
sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that threshold so 95% was</font>

326
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,710
just fine right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is</font>

327
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,810
are there these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these prefixes that</font>

328
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:19,290
we have tagged as<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visibility in one</font>

329
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,410
day are there any changes from one day

330
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,870
to the other do the prefixes just like

331
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,760
magically change their labels or do they

332
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,350
stabili stay like that and the question

333
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">is yes they stay really stay like that</font>

334
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,210
because we have done the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one day</font>

335
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,000
detection which you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see with red</font>

336
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,260
lines and red dots and then the

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,840
seven-day detection which means

338
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,430
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the set for each day</font>

339
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,340
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> making the intersection over seven</font>

340
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:48,000
days and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see on the y axis and</font>

341
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:51,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the upper plot from 95 90,000 prefixes</font>

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,040
to 115,000 and the the difference is

343
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the seven days detection and one</font>

344
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,050
day detection is just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 prefixes</font>

345
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,180
so it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very small</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that goes</font>

346
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,680
again for for the dark prefixes the

347
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,780
differences are very small so indeed

348
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,910
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stable expression of routing</font>

349
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,630
policy this is a step or a stable

350
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,969
expression of something going wrong now

351
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,370
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is does originating is is</font>

352
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,990
the original<font color="#CCCCCC"> is aware of this problem is</font>

353
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,280
it something that it intended it's

354
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,170
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted it's something</font>

355
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,910
that is suffering<font color="#CCCCCC"> from is it aware of</font>

356
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,400
the problem so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> are questions that</font>

357
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm addressing to you and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope to get</font>

358
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">answers for those questions and I'm</font>

359
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:31,199
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how i can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answers</font>

360
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,300
from you so the the tool is all this

361
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,100
information is available online the tool

362
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a public tool it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web page cages</font>

363
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:41,190
go there its visibility don't I TWC 3

364
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:44,750
i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not yes so like going your laptops</font>

365
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:48,450
and put this go to the website put your

366
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">eyes number there so for example there</font>

367
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fill your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes number</font>

368
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,240
then you get your prefixes this is just

369
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,910
an example you can check and how many

370
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,500
monitors your prefix is visible in how

371
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,540
many monitors the prefix is not visible

372
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,100
you can check if this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

373
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">visibility prefix or a limited</font>

374
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,250
visibility prefix and it's very

375
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,320
important I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned this the</font>

376
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,120
information is updated on a daily basis

377
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,760
so each day you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get new</font>

378
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,480
information you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually monitor and</font>

379
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:23,500
track how these changes every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day now</font>

380
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,930
there is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short serve survey that</font>

381
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,570
if you have the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> please fill you</font>

382
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,370
there are just four questions very for

383
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward questions do not forget</font>

384
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,170
to hit submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be very important</font>

385
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us to to tell apart prefixes that</font>

386
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,680
are meant to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited visibility</font>

387
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,939
from prefixes that are just a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

388
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,469
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to know if you are aware of</font>

389
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:48,580
this problem if this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

390
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:51,540
problem and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

391
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,820
the tool is available now<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

392
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:57,010
since three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and we have been</font>

393
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,770
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a bit with a few network</font>

394
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,180
operators and hear their stories as I

395
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,629
hope that today I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

396
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,359
hear your stories one common explanation

397
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,220
that we have we kept on hearing was that

398
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,689
these prefixes are injecting only to

399
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,970
pierce and that makes sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that</font>

400
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,620
immediately limits the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

401
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:18,339
visibility of that particular prefix

402
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:21,069
however another example for intended

403
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,470
scope advertisements we have found out

404
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:25,839
about this when talking with the content

405
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,480
provider who has geographically scoping

406
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,290
so on purpose scoping the<font color="#E5E5E5"> visibly the</font>

407
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:37,540
announcement for a particular prefix we

408
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:41,379
came up we came upon also some errors

409
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:43,840
from a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> I speak he was very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

410
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:47,380
and explained to us what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

411
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,629
there and we helped remove about 6,000

412
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">of unwanted prefixes that were just</font>

413
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:58,150
getting away in the internet so that was

414
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,010
that was a very strong result and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

415
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,040
we have been talking a bit with a few

416
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,549
root servers and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling us</font>

417
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,980
about

418
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:09,009
problems that were kind of inflicted by

419
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,360
third parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> so probably you're all</font>

420
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:13,749
aware of this but I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

421
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular example so this</font>

422
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:18,340
particular root servers were doing any

423
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">cast and one problem that they</font>

424
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,470
encountered was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem of no return</font>

425
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,830
pass if at appearing side they did not

426
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,629
have full transit from from appear so

427
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,649
that basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if a peer</font>

428
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:35,408
leaks the / 24 for example is a

429
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:38,830
announcement here to another peer then

430
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:40,570
the root server cannot respond to the

431
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,340
traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets from pier number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

432
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,039
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any return path</font>

433
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:48,158
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution they found for this was</font>

434
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tag locally the announcement of the /</font>

435
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,799
24 with no export<font color="#E5E5E5"> so pure number one</font>

436
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:56,619
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was received in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the / 24 it will</font>

437
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:59,710
it will no longer announce it to its

438
00:18:56,619 --> 00:19:02,649
peer number two so but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

439
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,470
not quite solved because this leads to

440
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:09,189
black holing duty no announcement so

441
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:11,609
this particular Road servers we're

442
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,960
announcing the / 24 with no export

443
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:16,389
locally but also from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> base camp</font>

444
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,879
without any tricks without any

445
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:21,008
communities so this means that let's

446
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:24,189
imagine that the period the pier<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

447
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:26,619
the previous example has a customer the

448
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:29,859
pier receives the / 24 no export locally

449
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:32,619
in the / 24 from the base camp it marks

450
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:34,359
as best route / 24 with no export then

451
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:37,090
this rod cannot be exported to the

452
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:41,289
customers so the customers cannot reach

453
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:43,509
the root server needless to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

454
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:45,999
should you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had this tool back in</font>

455
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:49,720
the day then you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to</font>

456
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:51,489
actually identify this problem so the

457
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,609
solution that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the réserver came up with</font>

458
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:57,279
is announcing the / 23 from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the base</font>

459
00:19:54,609 --> 00:20:00,399
camp as a unicast as a normal normal

460
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,799
prefix who which acted as kind of a

461
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:06,248
magnet for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic until the green</font>

462
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,859
peer who was then able throughout the to

463
00:20:06,249 --> 00:20:11,799
the local<font color="#E5E5E5"> root server to the local ad</font>

464
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:14,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">Castro so this was just an interesting</font>

465
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:16,539
example and the conclusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

466
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,969
takeaway message I want to leave you

467
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:22,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font>

468
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:25,340
and it's this evolution of the number of

469
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">limited visibility prefixes that we can</font>

470
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:32,168
observe here starting june last year and

471
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:35,000
well it's ending<font color="#CCCCCC"> december last year but</font>

472
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:39,289
the information is out there so you can

473
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,120
check it for today we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that since</font>

474
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:43,250
the bgp visibility scanner became

475
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,739
operational and people<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually started</font>

476
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,500
using it even if the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of monitors</font>

477
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,480
we are using its increasing the number

478
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> md visibility prefixes is decreasing</font>

479
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:58,600
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very strong result for us</font>

480
00:20:53,690 --> 00:21:01,549
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very encouraging this shows that</font>

481
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,219
people are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and people are</font>

482
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:07,879
finding it useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will find</font>

video stream chat as from mat pita yahoo

506

he asks are you sure that dark prefixes

507
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,500
aren't spammers doing fast flux

508
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:22,130
announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we haven't checked</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for that that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be that could be an</font>

explanation

511
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,340
you haven't checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that okay any</font>

512
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,340
other questions in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> room</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Freddy kunssler from unit seven</font>

514
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:45,049
brilliant talk thank you for sharing

515
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:47,869
this I have a suggestion it's sometimes

516
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:50,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">not only interesting whether the prefix</font>

517
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:53,869
is visible or not but also how the

518
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:59,629
prefix is seen so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s passes</font>

519
00:22:53,869 --> 00:23:02,539
are used for a certain prefix so maybe

520
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:04,189
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to go further in the studies</font>

521
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:11,179
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be interesting for some</font>

522
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:13,429
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you any other questions</font>

523
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:16,879
or suggestions I'm open to suggestions

524
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:20,649
as well and so here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

525
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:20,649
found limited visibility prefixes

526
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,029
Heather<font color="#E5E5E5"> shall our google fiber can you I</font>

527
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,978
don't see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your website it might be</font>

528
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,960
in the paper but<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you publish the</font>

529
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:32,509
full list of prefixes that you consider

530
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,220
dark or limited visibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> why did you</font>

531
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:36,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">should see anywhere that you could break</font>

532
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,090
it out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you could sort of do the</font>

533
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:40,428
inverse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at right right every</font>

534
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,320
fixes you can't right now we just you

535
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:44,509
just put your highest number there and

536
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,340
you get you get either the least of you

537
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:48,019
interviews ability or nothing if there's

538
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,779
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in jected by that particular s</font>

539
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:52,399
but yeah sure i mean i'd be happy to

540
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:55,159
recommend you could you could also look

541
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:57,678
at it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perspective of I'm na s</font>

542
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,509
what set of prefixes am I not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

543
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,789
that potentially other parts of the

544
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,979
world are seeing right so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what</font>

545
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:05,629
you're not which of your prefixes aren't

546
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:07,909
getting out what you're not getting in

547
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:10,070
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's very interesting</font>

548
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:13,519
as what we have been thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

549
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:16,099
to about ways to develop our our<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage</font>

00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:19,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course feedback is it's always</font>
