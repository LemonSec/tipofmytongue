00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,589
on the senior architect there so today

9
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,650
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about energy</font>

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,710
efficiency in the network and when i

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,570
define network<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm speaking more about a</font>

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:40,230
service delivery network for service

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,020
providers and on energy management it's

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:51,419
more about the monitoring of the network

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:54,329
and energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and power metrics so for</font>

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,379
today's presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

17
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:03,170
present the the problem statement what

18
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:05,548
spawned this this work and my use case

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,659
look at the information model for the

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,170
metrics the data models and those

21
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,040
protocols for collecting the metrics and

22
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:20,250
then my specific proposed protocol the

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,009
collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP dr SP as</font>

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,930
the protocol and then my overall

25
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,430
application framework and then wrap it

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:32,759
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my conclusions so in terms of</font>

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:39,450
the problem statement I guess this kind

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:43,320
of all began with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of hard to</font>

29
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,439
put where it began but<font color="#CCCCCC"> were where we</font>

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,320
started was the National Resources

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:54,258
Defense Council put out a report back in

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:59,210
2010 and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a study on set-top boxes</font>

33
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:01,829
older set-top boxes and found that

34
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're not very energy efficient they</font>

35
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,559
consume a lot of power but more

36
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,110
importantly is if you've ever turned off

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,209
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> set-top box you know the lights go</font>

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,709
out but in reality they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

39
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn off</font>

40
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:22,800
so there's millions of set-top boxes out

41
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:26,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the field for your your cable service</font>

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:32,830
your digital satellite broadcast service

43
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:34,989
your your telco TV service and this NRDC

44
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,430
report your estimates you know millions

45
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:39,190
and millions so there's you know

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,810
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> mega kilowatt hour usage of</font>

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,069
these set-top boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in the off</font>

48
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:53,440
state so then this report triggered a

49
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:56,109
Department of Energy docket on proposing

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,730
an energy conversate conservation

51
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,079
standard for set-top boxes and of course

52
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,030
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry came together</font>

53
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,890
and said we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to solve this problem</font>

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,650
before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government comes in and</font>

55
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,910
regulates us so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working to</font>

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:16,750
come up with standards on improving

57
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,489
efficiency in set-top boxes so device

58
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:24,420
manufacturers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are beginning to address</font>

59
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:27,910
this but what I'm talking about here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:31,630
we need tools in the back office to

61
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,840
monitor the power in the network and we

62
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,000
need to address this in the back office

63
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,440
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> state-of-the-art technology and</font>

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,560
state-of-the-art design approaches so

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,049
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> my use case it is cable</font>

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,970
centric here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example so in the</font>

69
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,500
know a cable platform with if we start

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,720
at the edge we have the in-home devices

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,780
being a gateway let's say it's a video

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:13,840
gateway cable modems voice modems

73
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:20,079
set-top boxes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:22,419
in homeland with routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smart TVs all</font>

75
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,300
these things which potentially are going

76
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:28,310
to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> green devices</font>

77
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,830
as manufacturers try to lower the energy

78
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,660
usage of these devices and then we move

79

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture is then enterprise networks</font>

84
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,049
and data centers but it really still

85
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,000
applies there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

86
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,389
entire network and then above the

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,490
network is of course the back office and

88
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,840
the network management layer the

89
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,150
business and service management layer

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,880
that's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do all the monitoring</font>

91
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the network and eventually control</font>

92
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,789
functions which my presentation doesn't

93
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,160
address but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> step once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

94
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:15,229
monitoring the the network you obviously

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,639
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start controlling functions in</font>

96
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:21,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well so I start off with</font>

97
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first step and that is what's the</font>

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,229
kind of information that we want to

99
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,789
monitor in the network and eventually

100
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:32,180
and eventually collect out of the

101
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:34,880
network so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step in in our</font>

102
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,740
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> is let's define a protocol</font>

103
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,840
agnostic information model that

104
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,669
represents<font color="#CCCCCC"> the common energy management</font>

105
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,580
information model for the entire network

106
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:47,210
in this case let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the service</font>

107
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,599
delivery network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably can't read</font>

108
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,758
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but the what I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

109
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:55,880
constructed here is the equivalent

110
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,820
information model for the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> etfs energy</font>

111
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,639
management SNMP mibbe there are going

112
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,889
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and building an SNMP mibbe for</font>

113
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,380
energy management which my theme is the

114
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:10,039
wrong approach and i'll get to that

115
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">because SNMP is you know an old archaic</font>

116
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:15,440
protocol and it's a data-centric

117
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,030
implementation specific data model we

118
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,889
need to define<font color="#CCCCCC"> an information model</font>

119
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,080
which is protocol agnostic that we can

120
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree on as an industry which is what</font>

121
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is conveying using uml class</font>

122
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:30,138
diagram syntax showing the objects their

123
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:34,070
attributes their associations and it's

124
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:36,919
not defined using a very archaic<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn.1</font>

125
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,150
syntax that many people don't understand

126
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,219
we can all understand

127
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:46,669
more readily this kind of syntax so once

128
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,830
we have a common model we can then if

129
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,800
you recall the chart the use case chart

130
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,020
we had different device types we had

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,180
those CPE devices the edge demarcation

132
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,700
devices we had the head end devices we

133
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,470
have the core devices and then we could

134
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,460
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data center devises wicked we</font>

135
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,550
could have the enterprise network

136
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,349
devices so what we do with those is we

137
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,120
create these interface profiles which

138
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:13,970
are views into the common management

139
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:16,580
model and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are then subsets of the</font>

140
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">common management model that are</font>

141
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:23,570
relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of device so for</font>

142
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:27,710
example a cpe often has a battery<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

143
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:30,890
example a packet packet cable or voice

144
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,719
modem<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a battery in it obviously for</font>

145
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,880
when the power goes out you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

146
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,180
phone calls so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those objects</font>

147
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,469
that's showing there on the the the left

148
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,360

150
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,440
din to include the battery object in its

<font color="#CCCCCC">network component view wouldn't probably</font>

155
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,650
include the battery object because it's

156
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:13,450
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a redundant failover power</font>

157
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:19,539
supply so from this we have sub

158
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:22,940
interface information models per device

159
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,640
from these information models that are

160
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,860
now specific to each device type we then

161
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,840
create a data model which is protocol

162
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,900
specific and implementable in the

163
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,429
devices in the network by translating

164
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,260
that into the data model of the protocol

165
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:44,390
management protocol of the service

166
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:50,330

168
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,790
by the data model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these so I PDR</font>

171
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,050
service definitions are based on XML

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,770

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipd RSP protocol and again that payload</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and all this is what I'm going to</font>

175
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,910
dive into deeper because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

my architecture net<font color="#CCCCCC"> compiègne modules</font>

177
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:20,650

net<font color="#CCCCCC"> comp protocol and its payload is</font>

179
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:28,630
again XML this is defined by IETF both

180
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:33,250
the yang modeling language and the

181
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:35,830
protocol is ietf standards TR 69 data

182
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,050
models or XML based and the transport

183
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,380
uses the TR 69 protocol and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's again</font>

those transport and data models are

191
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:08,890
defined by ATF so to talk about SNMP and

192

depth because it's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most widely</font>

197
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:33,130
static in nature it's not an extensible

198
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:37,540
language and you cannot define complex

199
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:40,990

200
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:45,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">cannot embed tables within tables and as</font>

207
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:07,220
define this a right only leaf that

208
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,220
that triggers an operation that's it's

209
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,770
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hokey and there's limited support</font>

210
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,310
for versioning and revisions manager and

211
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:18,350
agent really can't exchange what module

212
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,180
version is supported by the agent and

213
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:25,279
you can't advertise capability exchanges

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,319
between the manager and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the agent so in</font>

215
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:34,130
terms of the SNMP protocol limitations

216
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:36,440
anybody that's deployed massive networks

217
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:42,529
with SNMP collection knows that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

218
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:45,440
not scalable a big setback with SNMP is

219
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,900
you cannot do this atomic transaction

220
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,790
for configuration if you want a device

221
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of boot and get its full</font>

222
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:56,540
configuration cannot be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in SNMP</font>

223
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:59,180
SNMP can only set a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

224
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:03,230
objects per operation you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

225
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:06,589
backup in configuration restore with

226
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,650
SNMP and you cannot do validation of

227
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:12,680
configuration before activating that

228
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,569
configuration with SNMP it lacks support

229
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,810
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection or een oriented</font>

230
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,150
management session it's limited to UDP

231
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:27,020
connectionless and this can generate a

232
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:30,949
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more traffic due to retries for</font>

233
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:34,130
example a CMT s today has upwards of

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:39,380
three million managed objects try

235

other newer entrants xml-based entrance

250
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:31,290
these protocols were defined for

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:36,540
configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> management functions not</font>

252
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:40,199
bulk data collection so they transport

253
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,490
uncompressed XML therefore it really

254
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:45,930
leads to about 10 times the data size so

255
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,470
there's a much larger increased

256
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:53,250
bandwidth on the management traffic and

257
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,880
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more processing time on those</font>

258
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">network elements that are trying to</font>

transfer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> data up to the collection</font>

260
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,070

302
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:19,390
say for example 15 minutes streaming so

303
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,830
let's say you're collecting battery

304
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,900
information battery usage information

305
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,170
every 15 minutes you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stream</font>

306
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:29,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that information out via these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IPR data</font>

307
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,900
records to a collection system and that

308
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,600
collection system then transmits

309
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,560
northbound these records either in the

310
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:42,670
either in the XD are encoded format that

311
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,849
it got them in or it can expand those

312
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,870
back out to an xml-based file format and

313
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:53,290
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will push those northbound to a</font>

315
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">system like an energy management</font>

316
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,990

317
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,970
control system so the power control

318
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:08,470
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously has some policy</font>

319
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:10,720

320
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,300
case it detects that there's X

321
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,060
percentage of modems in the network that

322
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,649
have been idle for 3 days and it wants

323
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,839
to put those modems into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-power</font>

324
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,459
state and they can then<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect changes</font>

325
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,240
back down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network to put those</font>

326
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:31,360

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:36,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">state so what's the efficiency gained</font>

328
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:39,659
with this collection protocol you can

329
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,659
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can eliminate redundant information</font>

330
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,450
like with SNMP you walk tables all the

331
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,780
time you're walking tables but with this

332
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:51,480
protocol you have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

333
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,950
template negotiation so you can you know

334
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,850
when you're collecting records every 15

335
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,100
minutes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to keep</font>

336
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,320
collecting static data that never

337
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,419
changes right so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

338
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,050
collector<font color="#CCCCCC"> and exporter can negotiate</font>

339
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,820

340
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,440
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time interval</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15-minute</font>

341
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">collection we also have an event-based</font>

342
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:16,260
collection so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say part of the</font>

343
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:18,720
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> power outage occurs and a piece</font>

344
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,310
of the network to text<font color="#CCCCCC"> that outage so an</font>

345
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,560
event occurs he can stream some

346
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,240
information out to a collector saying

347
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,940
you know I see part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is</font>

348
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,040
out or we have this ad hoc session so

349
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,310
this ink asynchronous<font color="#E5E5E5"> event occurs and</font>

350
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,670
some streams can be sentient obviously a

00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,350
bandwidth reduction I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talked</font>

352
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:40,860
about this we have these XD<font color="#CCCCCC"> are binary</font>

353
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:46,770

and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I also mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll</font>

356
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:57,210
research utilization is minimized with

357
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:58,620
this compact encoding and more

358
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,710
importantly this it's a push model

359
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:04,979
instead of a pull model with SNMP you

360
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:08,640
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly pounding the device with</font>

these walks of these tables<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

362
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,750
device doesn't get to choose whether

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,330
he's busy or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're pounding it with</font>

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,850
a walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if he's busy and he's timing</font>

365
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:21,510
out SNMP keeps retrying and we tried and

366
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:24,840
we trying and keep pounding it that can

367
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:27,810
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real problem so with a PDR the</font>

368
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,280
device gets to decide when he's has the

369
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:33,899
resources available to push that

370
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:36,149
information up to the collector I PDRs

371
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP base so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font>

372
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,200
the connection oriented reliability of

373
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP and then finally we have the ability</font>

374
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have a redundant failover collector</font>

375
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:49,910
in the case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primerica lecture</font>

376
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,910
goes down

377
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:59,519
okay so in terms of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework this is</font>

378
00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:03,970
the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a high level picture of it</font>

379
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,499
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have these layers here at the</font>

380
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,669
bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the service delivery</font>

381
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:12,879
network with the different network

382
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:16,269
elements so let's say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sea</font>

383
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:20,100
MTS's routers and then maybe some cpe

384
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:23,860
devices maybe some set-top boxes and

385
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:28,509
they all implement this<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP dr exporter</font>

386
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:31,080
function or perhaps the set-top boxes

387
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:33,340
are aggregated under a device that

388
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,610
implements this aggregation and

389
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:40,049
collection and then CMT s exports that

390
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,729
information out for the set-top boxes

391
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:46,539
but they're all doing the monitoring of

392
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">the power utilization and battery</font>

395
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,820
an industry in that model the

396
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,369
information model that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed with the</font>

397
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:05,259
battery and all those associations

398
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:07,090
between the boxes so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

399
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:09,279
that we've standardized on the data

400
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,049
model the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in from the information model</font>

401
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,590
first and then we translated that to a

402
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:19,539
data model that data model is now in XML

403
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:21,789
and it's in an ipd our service

404
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:23,559
definition so we've standardized on the

405

percent of the modems are Idol and you

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning really we have protocols</font>

today I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to invent</font>

any new protocols to collect these

439

drive standardization of these

442
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,918
we do not want vendors to go off and

443
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:25,549
implement define their own metrics and

444
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:27,110
implement their own metrics so that's

445
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:29,360
the key that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive is</font>

446
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:34,299
let's work as an industry to define

447
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,469
these power metrics these energy metrics

448
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:37,908
you know these approaches with these

449
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,429
approaches we can enable this service

450
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:43,549
oriented architecture that I've shown in

451
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:45,169
the prior slide from honoring these

452
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:49,908
metrics so even though I've shown a

453
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:53,409
cable centric use case this this use

454
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:58,190
case can be used in any service provider

455
00:23:53,409 --> 00:24:02,900
network or any use case I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

456
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:08,530
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has devices out there in a IP</font>

457
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,530
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> network thank you</font>

458
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:21,509
six minutes for questions no questions

459
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you very much</font>
