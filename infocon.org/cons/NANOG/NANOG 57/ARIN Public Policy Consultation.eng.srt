comments and issues these are online in

the staff assessment we think we

100
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,369
understand the intent of the policy but

101
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the new policy text has a sentence which</font>

102
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,570
says

103
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,700
having allocated more than ninety

104

percent of their serving site blocks to

106
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,020
utilization of their serving sites to

107

continue to justify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the block size being</font>

utilized for all serving sites as

109
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,900
specified in section 6 52 is unclear

110
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,989
staff has suggested slightly clearer

111
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,310
text which<font color="#E5E5E5"> has allocated more than</font>

ninety percent of total address space to

113
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,840

114
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,719

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,540
slightly different but more player when

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,890
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we recommend that but we</font>

118
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,040
understand the intent of the policy

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,840
proposal either way legal assessment the

120
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,400
policy does not create significant legal

my summaries I always give people about

the way that we're laying out ipv6

networks and particularly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of</font>

commensurate with our mission<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

how plentiful the address spaces do we

artifacts of the ipv4 scarcity and slow

start thinking this policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempts to</font>

144
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,560
mitigate that to a certain extent by

145
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,960
allowing a longer term planning window

146
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,750
and allowing some mid-course Corrections

147
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,849
as the spaces rolled out in the service

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,069
but yet you need more dress space

205
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,830
because you aren't out in sufficient

but not significant liberalization that

233
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,660
there could be potentially few more

234
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,189
blocks of addresses coming out anybody

235
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,189
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like nodding or shaking their head</font>

236

nobody's nodding or shaking their head

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,460
looks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is potentially</font>

238
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,439
slightly more liberal in that sense I

239
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,720
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's probably a good thing as we</font>

240
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,460
are still in fact learning better ways

241
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,280
to do our address allocations and

242
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,290
assignments internally so sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

243
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,089
pilot probably good idea and are you so

you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor of the direction sounds</font>

245
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:12,760
like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea yes</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of kind of nitpicky issues all in all I</font>

251
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,710

253
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,930
talk about why this policies before us

254
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,810
and that's because a while back we

255
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,829
changed the initial allocation for ipv6

256
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:47,469
policy and we made that more liberal the

257
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:51,100
problem was most of the ISPs that came

258
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,960
qualified for a 32 they got a 32 and

259
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on the policy as was written at</font>

260
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,000
that time it had to be fairly well

261
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,560
utilized before they come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> for more</font>

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,870
when the initial allocation policy was

263
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,880
changed then anyone who hadn't gotten

264
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,450
space could suddenly qualify for much

265
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,520
more space so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here was to put</font>

266
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,430
the subsequent allocation policy in line

267
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:16,510
with the new more liberal initial

268
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:18,670
allocation policy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

269
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,150
of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerns as written with this</font>

270
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:25,680
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you go back one slide the</font>

271
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,680
the definition of serving site

272
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,370
and this is going to get complicated so

273
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,769
I apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one of my concerns is</font>

274
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:37,980
when the initial when the new initial

275
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:40,920
allocation policy was passed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

276
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,709
believed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could use serving</font>

277
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,219
sites and aggregation as a way to size

278
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:49,619
how much ipv6 addressing you could get

279
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:53,820
but have no intention of implementing

280
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,890
such aggregation or hierarchy and then

281
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,399
the expectation is that you could come

282
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">back with a single serving site</font>

283
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,690
qualifying for being out of address

284
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,459
space as a single serving site and get

285
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,019
additional space but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

286
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,149
additional space you could get would

287
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,570
again be<font color="#E5E5E5"> calculated on the formula that</font>

288
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:15,450
takes this hierarchy and oversizing into

289
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,850
account the way the definition of

290
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:21,120
serving site is going to newly be

291
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,769
defined suggests that you actually have

292
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:29,120
to put that addressing plan into effect

293
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:33,079
in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make use of this oversizing</font>

294
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,790
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why make that change</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that question actually well that makes</font>

297
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:43,199
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better mr. Schiller so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to</font>

298
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is there's also been some</font>

299
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,100
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how is this dealt with</font>

300
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:49,109
when you have a hierarchy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of serving</font>

301
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,149
sites for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an edge</font>

302
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,070
router that's aggregating customers a

303
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:54,959
number of edge routers in a single

304
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,540
location I get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a hub aggregation</font>

305
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,359
router you've carved your network into

306
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:06,660
metros or regional blocks within a

307
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:08,520
single continent so if one takes the

308
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,860
original formula where you take your

309
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">havill most heavily loaded serving site</font>

310
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,160
and count the number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> elements</font>

311
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,510
underneath it and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiply that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

312
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,760
the number of serving sites if you do

313
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,089
that up your hierarchy you can qualify

314
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">for much more address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> space and the</font>

315
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:26,120
concern was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would come up</font>

316
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,130
with interesting and complicated

317
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:33,300
hierarchical addressing plans just to

318
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:35,279
qualify<font color="#E5E5E5"> for additional IP space and the</font>

319
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,589
goal with this text was to try and say

320
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,020
you're actually going to you subnet your

321
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,610
numbering scheme along the lines you

322
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,500
described and I think that that makes

323
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense maybe to restrict people</font>

324
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:51,330
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with crazy hierarchical</font>

325
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:55,320
schemes but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's important to</font>

326
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">not change the rules</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that existed in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

327
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,720
now current initial allocations which is

328
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,729
that you can certainly simply use this

329
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,550
hierarchical math as an oversized

330
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:09,400
anumber to determine how much address

331
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,689
space you can get so so we need to try

332
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,060
to figure out how to balance those two

333
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,310
things that's my advice mr. ceased

334
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,430
Ramona respond and then mr. Kernan stick

335
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,979
around for one second so yeah Jason I

336
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,949
had a question since you since you said

337
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding</font>

338
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,820
that one actually needs budget to put

339
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,170
equipment out there and then

340
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,150
subsequently<font color="#E5E5E5"> number it and needs</font>

341
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,719
customers on that equipment to be able

342
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:38,260
to justify coming back under this

343
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,270
proposal um I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask you</font>

344
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,490
rhetorically I'm I don't want you to

345
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,100
actually named names here but who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

346
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,680
these people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be doing this</font>

347
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,470
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are there in the in the</font>

348
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,729
world and does this does this

349
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:56,200
possibility of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a corner case for for</font>

350
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:59,680
hoarding something that's an incredibly

351
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,600
plentiful resource in a corner case

352
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,839
where the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations that</font>

353
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">might try it might for some weird reason</font>

354
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:11,230
might be something that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

355
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:13,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">be counted on on one finger is that is</font>

356
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that reasonable thing to be worried</font>

357
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,199
about so to respond to you Jason chiller

358
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,040
google but i think the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

359
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,620
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would benefit from having</font>

360
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,390
much more larger oversaw over sized

361
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,880
chunks of address space or a few and<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

362
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:34,180
between I think more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but</font>

363
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,270
probably less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 probably around</font>

364
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">the neighborhood of five and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

365
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">those companies are allowed to scoop up</font>

366
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,870
extra address space in the grand scheme

367
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:48,880
of how much space is available in ipv6

368
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:51,279
it's negligible however I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

369
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,899
also need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write good policy that has</font>

370
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,649
or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community and will pass</font>

371
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:58,269
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public policy process and I</font>

372
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:03,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">suspect there are people that have</font>

373
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:06,039
concerns<font color="#CCCCCC"> even given how small the extra</font>

374
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,280
address base will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumed is in in</font>

375
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:11,500
the face of the total v6 pool and how

376
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,470
few companies potentially would be

377
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,059
interested in exercising this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

378
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just just wanted to point out that</font>

379
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:21,760
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and any policy out there is</font>

380
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,650
absolutely subject to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lu polling and and</font>

381
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,030
abuse by people who have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

382
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:30,030
spirit so thank you this is john curran

383
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:38,559
and it's regarding the staff

384
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:42,549
interpretation both of these so the this

385
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:46,059
policy proposal if adopted would allow

386
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:50,200
another way for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an</font>

387
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:53,678
additional allocation which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary</font>

388
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,230
because right now it is possible by

389
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,909
following your addressing plan to find

390
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,159
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an end case that wouldn't</font>

391
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:05,890
allow you hence the<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional bullet</font>

392
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:08,200
under 653 be with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fixed I think</font>

393
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:12,880
it's now feasible if the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font>

394
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:15,760
to to require organizations to actually

395
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,770
make use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's the addressing plan</font>

396
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,700
that they showed up with when they

397
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:24,340
requested their address space and not

398
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,039
say their routing follows that but that

399
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:30,220
their actual addressing plan is as they

400
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:34,780
described it it is true that the way

401
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:36,580
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case and 6b in the</font>

402
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,010
past the answer has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been well it really</font>

403
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,010
doesn't matter what your plan that you

404
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,679
justified your v6 allocation is you can

405
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,669
go do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something else and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

406
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,399
necessary if someone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find</font>

407
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves in a dead-end now that if you</font>

408
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:53,590
drop this policy proposal and you've

409
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,830
added 2653 be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text that allow</font>

410
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,350
someone who<font color="#CCCCCC"> has run out of serving site</font>

411
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,809
blocks to get another allegation then

412
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,139
it's no longer necessary for them to be

413
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to rearrange</font>

414
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,540
they're addressing plan at it's worth

415
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:12,080
holding them to the addressing plan we

416
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,940
have the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with people if</font>

417
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,679
they're not held<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their addressing</font>

418
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:21,820
plan is as Jason said convoluted

419
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,980
hierarchical assignment schemes<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

420
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:29,179
use a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits very quickly you find</font>

422
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:36,640
teens more rapidly than you might

423
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:39,650
imagine so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that if the community</font>

424
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,530
recognizes that this prevents an

425
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,720
organization from getting stuck with its

426
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,280
addressing plan because now if they run

427
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of servings lightbox they have an</font>

428
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,700
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the text of serving site is</font>

429
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:58,310
quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasonable if you didn't have 653</font>

430
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:03,070
be then the 21 change might leave some

431
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:10,790
organizations in a bind mr. Schiller

432
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:12,710
Jason chiller<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google so in the event</font>

433
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,260
that somebody decides to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a flat</font>

434
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,890
network with no hierarchy they have a

<font color="#E5E5E5">single serving site they can certainly</font>

436
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,420
use up all the available blocks in there

437
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,640
serving site and qualify to come back

438
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,390
and get more space as you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> described</font>

00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,850
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about is when</font>

441
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:39,409
such a network comes back how much space

442
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:42,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">do they qualify for and under the</font>

443
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,870
current initial allocation they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick</font>

444
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,520
some hierarchy in their network as a

445
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,199
serving site and count the number of

446
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">elements under that serving site and</font>

447
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,650
then multiply<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> across the number of</font>

448
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,270
serving sites and then round that up to

449
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:58,130
a nibble and come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some sized</font>

450
00:20:53,270 --> 00:21:00,920
chunk of addressing if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> then turn</font>

451
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:02,720
around and do a flat<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and run</font>

452
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,970
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're exhausted and qualify to</font>

453
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,910
come back for more can they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

454
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,740
same formula that says n number of

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">things under a serving site times and</font>

456
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,669
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> serving sites comes up with</font>

457
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,918
some chunk rounded up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nibble and</font>

458
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:20,190
based on this text<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the answer is</font>

459
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,499
no and that's kind of changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules</font>

460
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,350
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the intention of the</font>

461
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:27,600
subsequent allocation was so that you

462
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,600
could apply under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same policy as the</font>

463
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,119
initial allocation which this is a

464
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,619
difference so Jason just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clarify</font>

465
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,389
think you earlier said that you do

466
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:37,678
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concept of the problem</font>

467
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:39,149
trying to be solved<font color="#E5E5E5"> but do you have</font>

468
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,509
these concerns with the text obviously

469
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:46,139
or did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I misunderstand you yes so</font>

470
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:47,789
there's two prongs here on one prong you

471
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:50,340
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're giving</font>

472
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:53,879
sufficient address base and dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

473
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:57,928
hierarchy and some of the language in

474
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:59,969
the text is to try and constrain abuse

475
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:02,239
of hierarchy and just tire key just for

476
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,799
the sake of getting additional addresses

477
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:08,929
there's some collateral damage along

478
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:12,389
with that text in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now changes</font>

479
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:14,789
the intent of the initial allocation as

480
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:16,678
well because currently as written the

481
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:19,080
initial allocation allows you to come to

482
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,690
Aaron and say look I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't ever plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

483
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,369
having hierarchy in my network however<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

484
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,330
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chunk of addresses that's this</font>

485
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:29,039
big based on this formula of a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

486
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,539
units under a serving site times n

489
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:39,989

<font color="#E5E5E5">John has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a one fall go ahead so you are</font>

491
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:46,379
correct the change to 21 for being a

492
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:49,320
definition actively changes more than

493
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:51,209
just subsequent allocations it changes

494
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,210
how we will interpret initial

495
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:55,889
allocations requiring people to be have

496
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,950
some fidelity to the plan that they

497
00:22:55,889 --> 00:23:00,359
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use your correct so seeing no</font>

502
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,249
quickly I'll just look over to this

582
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,610
reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or the reason the reason</font>

583
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:53,250
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the residential broadband</font>

584
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:54,479
policy currently allows for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50-percent</font>

585
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,310
utilization rate rather than an eighty

586
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,140
percent utilization rate and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

587
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is the the</font>

588
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,320
Aaron policy should not assert<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

589
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,820
a difference what that's alluding to is

590
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,649
the fifty percent versus eighty percent

591
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,250
utilization rate for residential

592
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:14,280
subscribers versus mobile subscribers so

593
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:16,260
the current text is fairly simple it

594
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,360
strikes at a place of residence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> adds</font>

595
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,090
regardless of OSI layer one or two

596
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,520
technologies effectively changing the

597
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,530
residential customer definition to

598
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,110
instead of defined a residential

599
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,700
customer it now defines a personal user

600
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:32,729
basically someone who's not a commercial

601
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:37,290
user of the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right with that</font>

602
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:39,890
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'll open up the mics so this is</font>

603
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:43,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">a proposal not yet a formal draft policy</font>

604
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,940
what would be also very useful as just

605
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,710
if people feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font>

606
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,450
statement is a problem we're solving so

607
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,310
even if you don't want to comment on the

608
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,510
specific text that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful so I</font>

609
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:57,120
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mics and ask if those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

that again the purpose here

614
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:14,370
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really for policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parity when the we</font>

615
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:18,030
believe when the policy was written the

00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:20,159
the functional pieces on the wireline

618
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,400
slam historically the policy was written

619
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:28,919
for efficiencies and with the evolution

620
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless network what we're</font>

proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> are for like functions of the</font>

622
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,430
network that the policy be the same

623
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:47,190
that's essentially what we're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

624
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thank You</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Center microphone man pound</font>

625
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:55,110
said Phileas the sorry I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

626
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,940
trying to piece together exactly how all

627
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:01,320
this fits together because as far as I

628
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:06,530
can tell section 213 is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition</font>

629
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,530
that is only applied in privacy issues

630
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,560
it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the it changes the definition of</font>

631
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,750
residential customer and the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

632
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:21,419
where the term residential customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier</font>

633
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:23,400
is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is privacy yeah so</font>

634
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,870
you're exactly right the the current

635
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,140
text the current proposed text does not

636
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,699
do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the author wants to do but what</font>

637
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,810
we're trying to discuss is what the

638
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,390
author actually wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and we can</font>

639
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,950
figure out text later right okay so so I

640
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,840
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're absolutely correct the the</font>

641
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,760
definition was tied specifically to the

642
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,020
residential customer privacy policy yeah

643
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,840
it's the only place in the NR p.m. the

644
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,280
term is used<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so the changing the</font>

645
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,500
definition does not do<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the author</font>

646
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,530
things it does but right still adjusting

647
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,040
the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I guess</font>

648
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:56,010
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> main comment I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that</font>

649
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,510
the there's still a massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem this</font>

650
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:02,510
problem statement because it doesn't

651
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:05,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually describe a problem it describes</font>

652
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:09,000
they can do it so I should be able to to

653
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,610
the the cable access provider has had to

654
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,210
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

655
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:17,810
justify changing the way allocation

656
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:20,669
worked because of the way C MTS's

657
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:26,668
operate as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand it this is the</font>

658
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:28,619
we're comparing<font color="#E5E5E5"> two right I see no</font>

659
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:31,909
justification here for doing that for

660
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:37,649
for any other type of access there's no

661
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:41,429
explanation of why it's necessary it's

662
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:43,439
it simply boils down to they can do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

663
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:44,580
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to to and I don't think I</font>

664
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,100
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good enough</font>

665
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,529
justification so you're not supportive

666
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this problem no no no i mean it's</font>

667
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:53,789
it's entirely possible reframed with

668
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,859
lots of explanation about exactly how

669
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:57,629
this works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why it's necessary I</font>

670
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:59,970
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> change my opinion but the way this</font>

671
00:31:57,629 --> 00:32:01,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">is written out now no well conveniently</font>

672
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:04,529
if I believe I owe the right Mike we can

673
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:06,629
ask the author Jason<font color="#CCCCCC"> Claver got tmobile</font>

674
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:08,820
I'm not the author but I'm sorry from

675
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">our cozy so it's yep so r on the same</font>

676
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,009
page it's our understanding that

677
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:18,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously we're after section 4 237 and</font>

678
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:21,480
as interpreted by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron team that</font>

679
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,720
this would the intent was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address</font>

680
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,669
section<font color="#CCCCCC"> 213</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that it could be</font>

681
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,350
interpreted for parody and I can

682
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:29,940
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cable and other</font>

683
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireline folks did have to do a lot of</font>

684
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,139
work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day they did</font>

685
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,169
it for efficiencies in working with

686
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:38,969
Aaron in for allocation and we applaud

687
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:41,789
that right what we're saying is hey we

688
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,129
have the same type of problem we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

689
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:47,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">to share in some of those efficiencies</font>

690
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:49,379
so our apologies is you flicked madly

691
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,029
through the book looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4237 you'll</font>

692
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:53,248
notice it is not there yeah it's not

693
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:55,379
there we did identify unfortunately very

694
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:57,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">late a printing error</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you wish to</font>

695
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:58,889
follow along you can just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the air</font>

696
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:00,960
and website and see the current versions

697
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:02,850
of PDP even<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn over turn yeah if</font>

698
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,919
you are apologies for that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

699
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,439
need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the iron website and you</font>

700
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:11,070
can pull down policies pull down n RPM

701
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:15,049
and you'll see the text for 237 which

702
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:18,090
applies to residential subscribers and

703
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:21,989
it's it's what would end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

704
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,939
implicated in this so sorry staff do

705
00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:30,359
feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 237 will be implicated by</font>

706
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:33,910
this or you can also under 42 373

707
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:41,310
there's a section called residential

708
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:41,310
drivers which<font color="#CCCCCC"> described describes a</font>

709
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,170
alternate policy used for residential

710
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,290
service areas of 50 to 80 / uterus

711
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:53,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent utilization so changing this</font>

712
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:56,050
definition would allow use of that

713
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,820
residential subscriber section and the

714
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,040
fifty percent utilization which is what

715
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're trying to affect you can't</font>

716
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,040
discern that from looking at the

717
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,910
discussion guide you can if you go

718

why<font color="#E5E5E5"> one very specific technology which</font>

not getting about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

729
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:41,260
probably is but it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that we</font>

730
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,320
have rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> for different technologies</font>

731
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,120
sometimes as exceptions for reasons and

732
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,830
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we should be</font>

733
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,650
discussing I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

737
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:59,140

738
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,939
way to do this I guess but i'm also very

739
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,500
confused so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just confused everyone</font>

00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:25,510
discuss the real issue whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

our colleague from t-mobile could sort

of inform the discussion a little bit

and and explain a little bit more

what's driving this from a mobile phone

the appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> term of art is here but</font>

782
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,790
I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can in the discussion d</font>

783
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:06,380
couple and not use the term wireless

784
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:10,109
because it unfortunately conflates

785
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:13,830
people who are wireless ISPs wisps doing

786
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:15,990

00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:27,210
the discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know your 3g 4g</font>

790
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,799

795
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:43,230
valid points here functionally what we

00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:47,310
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 237 was written for again as</font>

798
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,390
piece of infrastructure aggregating

00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:54,270
subscribers at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day and</font>

800
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:58,650
that's where they anchor were their home

801
00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:01,690
their IP address where IP addresses are

802
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:05,380
pools are configured allocated and

803
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:08,980
dispersed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to users so again it comes</font>

804
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:12,070
down to fundamentally the the planning

805
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,590
the design piece of it but again that's

806
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:18,340
our interpretation of why that section

807
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:20,770
was built so see mts equivalent to a

808
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,240
wireless would be a ggsn<font color="#CCCCCC"> SP gateway</font>

809
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,860
something that essentially anchors the

810
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,959
customer when they're within the

811
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">geographic boundaries of the services</font>

812
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,340
that the ip's would live<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I apologize</font>

813
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,980
that's a little bit vague if you guys

814
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,890
have some some additional specific cases

815
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,510
questions things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm happy to</font>

816
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:40,750
expand on thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mr. Kern</font>

817
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,570
right actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

818
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:48,040
easiest way to think about what the

819
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:50,770
issue might be defined as is if you look

820
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:54,100
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> president present residential</font>

821
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:56,560
customer definition it's for its for

822
00:38:54,100 --> 00:39:02,080
individual persons receive service at a

823
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:04,750
residence fixed wireless as some of us

824
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,420
lived within the LMDS days<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

825
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:10,630

827
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:18,610
meet what doesn't meet is service for a

828
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:21,250
personal user who's in a geographic area

829
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:23,880
but presently has no residence and is

830
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,840
within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> service area of a cell that</font>

831
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,420
Aaron would not consider meeting

832
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:32,670
residential customer where a fixed point

833
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:36,220
to point wireless we would it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

834
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:38,380
the definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the term fixing this</font>

835
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,049
for wireless parity is actually probably

836
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,150
defined as better defined as fixing it

837
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:47,440
for mobile parity which is what's being

838
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:49,030
sought<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you I I think that makes sense</font>

839
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,110
at the end of the day it comes down to

840
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:57,250
resources and allocation right so again

841
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:59,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">our interpretation of we didn't see a</font>

842
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,530
need and why this was proposed of

843
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,450
whether a person was physically or

844
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:06,940
billing wise tethered to an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

851
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:22,359
really saw it because we can fin itely

852
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,459
identify customers to an area that there

853
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:26,348
is commonality in the function of the

equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thus the requests are</font>

00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:01,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly would would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you use as a problem</font>

866
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,569
say what's the problem you're facing

867
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,979
that you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve if it's</font>

868
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:07,599
just I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what people are saying</font>

869
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:09,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're saying well it's just not fair</font>

870
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,289
that's our problem but you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:13,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical problem you're trying to</font>

872
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:16,259
overcome that your face at each day

873
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,630
absolutely so Jason clarity Mulligan

874
00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:22,239
it's really efficiency in working with

875
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:24,189
the errand and allocating resources we

876
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,079
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this policy was written for</font>

877
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:27,339
that very reason otherwise everybody

878
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,900
would adhere to the normal eighty

879
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:32,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent but there's efficiencies and</font>

880
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,089
infrastructure serving larger masses so

881
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:39,038
the request really is for policy parity

882
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:40,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">for v4 v6 future type allocations ok I'd</font>

883
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,219
like to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the remote participation</font>

884
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:43,719
that's been patiently waiting and I'd

885
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:45,969
ask though before if anybody would like

886
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,170
to make a comment still to approach the

887
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:52,119
mike says we're gonna have to close due

could end up affecting me i'm in favor

898
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,359
of moving this

899

proposal forward in the policy process

900
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:31,890
but I have some heartburn about the

901
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,869
problem statement there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of blank</font>

down a little bit more but I do support

906
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,319
advancing the proposal in the process so

907
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,109
last call otherwise we will close the

923
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:31,020
what we've heard over and over again is

924
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:33,390
that the current policy isn't liked but

925
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,530
the current policy didn't come about out

926
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a vacuum we came about because there</font>

927
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,520
were specific technical needs that were

929
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,030
really do is identify what that

say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have transferred an asn or v4</font>

you can't transfer an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn or v4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

977
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,800
potentially that might want to be

00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:58,260
respectively if you've transferred a v4

979
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,720
then you cannot participate in another

980
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,630
transfer for 12 months or if you've

981
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,390
transfer an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn you can't but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:08,460
very small knit the policy change is

983
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:11,910
very simple and it's a consequence of

984
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,830
the simplicity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the text presently so</font>

985
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm now going to let the Shepherd come</font>

00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,640
that uh Scott and Heather were the offer

00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,810
doing the musical chairs here so open

1009
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:39,569
the microphones for those that would

1010
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:43,250
like to talk either<font color="#E5E5E5"> in support or</font>

1011
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:46,170
against this draft pulse of 2013 one

1012
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:48,960
again mr. Howard just saying it off Lee

Howard Time Warner Cable a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">people mate maybe one has done analysis</font>

1015
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:57,600
on how much address space could

1016
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,830
potentially be transferred ipv4 address

1017
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,230
space could potentially be transferred

1018
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:04,410
in a market or<font color="#E5E5E5"> between regions or</font>

00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:06,300
anything or<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe I haven't shown you</font>

1020
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:09,240
guys that that analysis yet and it'll be

1021
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,580
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next day ugh has anybody done any</font>

1022
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:15,629
analysis on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many ASNs might be</font>

1023
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:19,350
transferred is this a big problem a

1024
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:23,640
small problem a potato shaped problem so

1025
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:25,620
first note that this is presently if

1026
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:29,069
adopted in the yarn region one hand

1027
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:31,950
clapping a matching policy would need to

1028
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:36,510
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted in another region to allow</font>

1030
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:41,190
occur then we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what's</font>

1031

potentially available to transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

note that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had within the intern</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about that at nano tomorrow when I give</font>

1036
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:59,250
aren't unheard of people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking the</font>

00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,900

potentially of the draft policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest</font>

1039
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,710
potentially that

1040
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,509
if an<font color="#E5E5E5"> innocent transfer is useful</font>

1041
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:10,680
potentially could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful in to our IR</font>

1042
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:13,260
but I'm not actually sure unlike v4 that

1043
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,629
has a run-out condition I'm not actually

1044
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,460
sure why an operator would need to

1045
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,319
transfer at all so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font>

1046
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,569
there's a lot of demand there's

1047
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:23,400
certainly a lot of supply can you click

1048
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:26,369
and I follow up in that question oh no

1049
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,730
can I follow up on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1050
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:31,380
so the the transfers that have happened

1051
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:33,150
are those specified transfers or

1052
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,710
transfers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are those merger and</font>

1053
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,049
acquisition transfers specified

1054
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:39,450
transfers of I believe yeah all three

1055
00:49:37,049 --> 00:49:41,520
raid 3 specified transfers of three<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns</font>

1056
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:44,038
they're armed they're listed in the

1057
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,140
stats files and online the reason i ask

1058
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:49,260
is because you said that there is no run

1059
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:51,450
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a SNS the way there is in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1060
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,339
address space but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are different</font>

1061
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,259
sized<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs much like there are different</font>

1062
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">sized IP addresses and so I could</font>

1063
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,950
imagine there being some connection

1064
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,170
there and some people want shorter<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs</font>

1065
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,569
or lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs or you know magic</font>

1066
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:05,010
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs or something but I don't</font>

1067
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:06,779
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm that's what I'm trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1068
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,779
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out is whether we need to spend</font>

1069
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:12,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">time on this so currently we still have</font>

1070
00:50:09,779 --> 00:50:16,680
the shorter ones though so i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1071
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:18,538
and we may have them for some time so it

1072
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,960
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be due to lack of availability I</font>

1073
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:23,460
do understand some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people like a SNS</font>

1074
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,940
that look pretty and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be</font>

1075
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:28,980
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> patterns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are lower but I don't</font>

1076
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,839
think run out is a driver at this point

1077
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,970
if that's the question mr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Howard are</font>

1078
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:35,640
you here to speak in favor against or

1079
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:38,490
you're still so so at the moment I am

1080
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">opposed because I can't find a reason it</font>

1081
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,220
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look to me like it's actually</font>

1082
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:43,380
needed but I would be happy to entertain

1083
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,480
arguments that it is thank you that's

wonderful input<font color="#E5E5E5"> center microphone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt</font>

1085

pound said Phileas yeah by comment is

1086
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:57,079
sort of related to the while on the one

1087
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:59,730
hand I understand the urge to symmetry

1088
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:03,089
yeah I'm not exactly sure there's this

1089
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:05,880
is necessary like we have that there is

1090
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:07,710
no rir that is running<font color="#E5E5E5"> short on a SNS I</font>

1091
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,049
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a particular reason to</font>

1092
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,539
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> time on this unless somebody has a</font>

1093
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:14,990
has come up against a specific problem

1094
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:17,660
that needs fixing

1095
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:23,140
so yeah I'd say I'm against it unless we

1096
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">can clarify that somehow Thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> You</font>

chillin google i agree with two previous

00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,840
speakers against for the same reasons

1100
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:38,180
but in terms of symmetric symmetric<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cole</font>

1101
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,300
myths which is a desirable property

1102
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:46,339
apparently why would we not also include

1103
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:48,230
ipv6 number resources assuming we think

1104
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:50,750
having a symmetrical policy is important

1105
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,580
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're opposed as written right now</font>

00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,070
poorly paraphrase it but there has been

1118
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:34,130
some discussion on the pp ml regarding

1119
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:36,140
rationale for asn transfers and one of

1120
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:38,780
them was basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the long along the</font>

lines of purchasing an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn for the</font>

1122
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:43,040
purine advantages right so that there

slightly stronger that in the case of

some legal contracts the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn number</font>

might actually be included so<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1134
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:10,900
grabbing hold of such a number you could

00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,899
then have legal rights to pure

Time Warner Cable ok so it took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

1139
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:31,000
minute to sort of digest with Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1140
00:53:27,549 --> 00:53:33,190
said as a nuance of Chris's comment so I

1141
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,680
think what Jason said is if I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1142
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:37,900
buy let's say a s<font color="#E5E5E5"> 701 that's a that's a</font>

1143
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,910
funny-looking is let's say I can buy a s

1144
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,130
701 for five hundred dollars that there

1145
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:44,078
are contracts in existence which would

1146
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:46,119
give me rights like I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> then have</font>

unnecessary paper and have gone to in

our regular policy meetings we've gone

to consolidated guides and less paper we

thought for kicking off these at nanog

01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:04,919
it might be good because not everyone's
