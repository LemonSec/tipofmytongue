1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,560
oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those of you who were</font>

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,789
with us at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last meeting we were</font>

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:36,120
leading up into the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU the wicked</font>

4
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:38,640
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we go and there was a</font>

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we thought would</font>

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,800
happen and there was a decent<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

7
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,410
rhetoric and there was certainly a lot

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
of hypothesis being thrown around

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:51,300
because it's such a closed ecosystem

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,410
that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are unfamiliar with and</font>

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,269
so that seems scary what we wanted to do

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,538
was have someone talked to you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,640
actually there and who can get you know

14
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,320
bring us up to date on what the goings

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,290
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and what we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember is</font>

16
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just one more or less</font>

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">speed bump this will happen again we</font>

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,710
will have other regulatory bodies try to

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,250
come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> we may just as well have the ITU</font>

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,580
come back around again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I'd like</font>

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to invite sally wentworth up she is the</font>

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,479
and I think she's uniquely qualified to

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,619
help us nerds understand exactly what

27
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,210
happened from a policy perspective

28
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,960
because this is important to our

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyday lives</font>

30

hi good afternoon everyone and thanks

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,330
for to the to the nanog program

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,610
committee for inviting me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak and</font>

33
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,650
it's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Orlando as</font>

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:06,220
somebody said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I flew in from Ohio where</font>

35
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:09,660
it's considerably colder so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:13,239
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> change of pace I hope you'll also</font>

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,579
tolerate a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a more policy</font>

38
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,250
oriented set of remarks a little bit

39
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,880
more formal we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the</font>

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,730
wicket which is formal by design so if

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,739
you'll if you'll keep up and put up with

42
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,619
with a more formal statement than I hope

43
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:33,090
at the end we could have a more fulsome

44
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,519
discussion of where we go from here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

45
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,860
so last<font color="#CCCCCC"> year's Steve Feldman described</font>

46
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,510
nanog as a whole bunch of people who

47
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,540
work together and spend a lot of time

48
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,220
arguing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about stuff that seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

49
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,320
particularly good jumping off point for

50
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,200
for my talk today which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">recent world conference on international</font>

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,828
telecommunications or what we call

53
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,780
wicket which is another place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where a</font>

54
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:58,570
whole bunch of people came together to

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,250
basically argue about stuff the stuff

56
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,720
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were arguing about a wicket was</font>

57
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,640
pretty different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you might see</font>

58
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,190
on an anti mailing list but it's

59
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,750
important to all of us so if you don't

60
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind bear with me as I tell you what</font>

61
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,519
happened and hopefully convince you

62
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,170
about why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should care the main</font>

63
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,019
agenda item<font color="#E5E5E5"> for wicket which took place</font>

64
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,089
in December<font color="#CCCCCC"> this last year was revising</font>

65
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,799
an international treaty governing

66
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,570
telecommunications things like

67
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,420
interconnection of telephony networks

68
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,250
and roaming for mobile phone rates these

69
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,200
days<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy makers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in many countries are</font>

70
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,380
increasingly apt to put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet in</font>

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same category as telephony and</font>

72
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,150
telecommunications international treaty

73
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,860
negotiation is layer 9 stuff but believe

74
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,440
me it has a lot of practical

75
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,910
implications but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump into the</font>

76
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,650
details of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened at Wickett</font>

77
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,329
without any context might<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font>

78
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,540
narrative that's not that interesting

79
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,489
and hard to follow so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

80
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,709
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conclusion a bit like jumping</font>

81
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:55,840
to the head end of a chapter in a book a

82
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,120
much larger book as somebody had already

83
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,380
said and if you see how this chapter

84
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,440
ends you might worry a little bit

85
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,910
because wicket did not go well I say

86
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,980
this not as a citizen of one of the

87
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,320
countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> chose not to sign the</font>

88
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,970
revised treaty more on all the politics

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,440
of that in a few minutes but as a

90
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,710
representative of a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization</font>

91
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet society whose mission it is</font>

92
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,450
to advocate<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the things about the</font>

93
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,980
internet that make it great and I'll add

94
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,469
just one other point which I hope will

95
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,790
resonate with many of you today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

96
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that the things that happened in</font>

97
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,380
Dubai although carried out as part of an

98
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,060
intergovernmental process all the layer

99
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">9 stuff that you're so familiar with</font>

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things could potentially have a</font>

118
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,150
sign of what was brewing came in 2011

119
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,490
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> China Russia tajikistan and</font>

proposal for an international code of

123

proposal included a line<font color="#E5E5E5"> about curbing</font>

the rifts between delegations countries

294
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,630
became entangled in a highly political

295
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,060
debate over human rights that resulted

296
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a contentious vote that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

301
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,819
December 1489 countries signed the

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an important air it's</font>

314
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,850
that gives you a chart of how the

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,820
different countries voted at least in

316

December and Dubai

317
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,440
recognizing of course that that chart is

321

importantly to this group here that

about everything regulatory threats like

know the internet just keeps growing and

evolving and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expectations are for</font>

years but keep in mind many of these new

602
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,340
users will come from developing

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,879
all interlinked and the benefits will

606
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,429
only accrue if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet retains the</font>

610
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,240
is that we will one day look back on

<font color="#CCCCCC">wicked as a troubling chapter in a</font>

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,460
longer story that ultimately came out

613
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,900
well as opposed to signaling a negative

was said earlier it did not begin at

00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,340
Wickett and it certainly doesn't end

620
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,830
there and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all have an obligation to</font>

shape where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story goes next the</font>

622
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,549
collective good is dependent upon the

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,840
contributions ideas and efforts of

624
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:50,660
people and countries everywhere

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,070
including those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you in this room so</font>

626
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,549
the stuff worth arguing about is

627
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,020
happening as i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some new places</font>

628
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:59,299
but it's worth getting involved and it's

629
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,030
worth being heard so thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

630
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:05,629
listening to a formal presentation and

631
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,610
I'd be happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help lead in a</font>

632
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:11,470
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> or answer any questions that</font>

you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the wicked thanks</font>

634
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:29,000
any questions from the floor answered

635
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:31,450
all the questions amazing stunned

636
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,450
silence

637
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:15,919
Kenny and I think someone needs to turn

638
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:17,359
the mics on but yes sure sure so the

639
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,519
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does it mean that the</font>

640
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:23,629
u.s. decided not to sign the<font color="#CCCCCC"> treaty what</font>

641
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:26,929
does that mean going forward obviously

642
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:28,969
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US + 55 countries chose not to sign</font>

643
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:32,960
which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lack of</font>

644
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:36,379
consensus so going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> wicket there was</font>

645
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,200
a 1988 treaty that was basically the

646
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:42,340
consensus for communications regulation

647
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,340
the absence of consensus I think means

648
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,168
an increase in uncertainty in the

649
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,649
regulatory market or the regulatory

650
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:54,409
space internationally one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

651
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:57,768
that it may signal and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just at</font>

652
00:26:54,409 --> 00:27:02,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the US but that these 55 countries that</font>

653
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:04,489
you see a schism or a rift between

654
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,918
countries that signed in countries that

655
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:10,669
didn't sign and what we're likely to see

656
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:14,029
going forward is the consequences<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

657
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:17,149
that rift permeating future policy

658
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:19,940
discussions I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the rift is</font>

659
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:22,099
clearly defined in North versus South

660
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,200
developed vs developing country as you

661
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,879
is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look back on the on the</font>

662
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,629
countries that sign the<font color="#E5E5E5"> treaty and I</font>

663
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:34,849
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went fast on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one that's one</font>

664
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:37,219
more yeah it's important so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

the the link down at the bottom but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

666
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:43,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the bottom line is its uncertainty</font>

667
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:47,389
you have a major leading economy major

have implications for the regulatory

673
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:02,379
consensus going forward for sure

674
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:19,300
still no behind you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

675
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,580
that's what it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you talked</font>

676
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:25,750
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting it getting in touch with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to the sort of consensus based way of</font>

doing things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might be how</font>

681
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,090
receptive define they are typically

682
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:43,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">amina I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to think if their</font>

683
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:45,850
policy makers and you know they derive

their power and<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaning from making</font>

686
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,660
how receptive are they to sort of

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,330
changing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all up it's a tough change</font>

688
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,400
I mean clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think if you look at</font>

689
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,370
the Internet's impact on policy making

690
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,250
in general not just related to telecom

691
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:07,719
or communications you see a considerable

692
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:11,590
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the expectations of individual</font>

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,840
citizens and a country<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved to</font>

694
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,790
have information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about policy if you're</font>

695
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">just looking at the the u.s. you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

696
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,860
that in things like political debates

697
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,590
over health care or political debates

698
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,110
over gun control or other major

699
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,899
political issues people<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect the</font>

00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,570
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Pete to facilitate more</font>

701
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,520
engagement and more involvement that's a

702
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,950
difficult transition for<font color="#E5E5E5"> policymakers to</font>

703
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,800
make in general it's difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the US</font>

704
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:42,040
and it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere having</font>

705
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,860
said that I think for many countries

706
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,560
they ultimately want more of this

707
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology and what we found in bringing</font>

708
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:53,590
the countries and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the policymakers to</font>

709
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:56,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF clearly not and negotiating</font>

710
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,270
forum clearly not a policy forum there's

711
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:02,770
a real hunger for information on how

712
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:05,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">things actually work and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they can</font>

713
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,960
factor that real technical information

714
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,780
into their policy making so I think

715
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of receptivity the problem</font>

716
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,440
is is when you put a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

717
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,360
governments together in a negotiating

718
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,590
environment they do what they do best

719
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,758
which is negotiate and it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

720
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,478
then make that process and close

721
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:28,909
which is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think why the more</font>

722
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:31,429
informative the more educational the

723
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:35,269
more capacity building we can do it

724
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:37,219
might lessen the desire by countries to

725
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:39,619
push everything into a negotiating

726
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:42,409
environment we can't be unrealistic

727
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:45,019
about that there's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> remains a</font>

728
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:47,179
tendency and it remains a desire by

729
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:50,899
certain governments and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll still have</font>

730
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:55,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to face</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're at least</font>

731
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:57,289
somewhat optimistic about the desire by

732
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,629
individuals in those governments to

733
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:02,779
actually have solid technical

734
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:06,918
information that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with hi</font>

735
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:08,839
Suzanne Suzanne<font color="#CCCCCC"> wolf I see and an answer</font>

736
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:11,529
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last question I actually wanted</font>

737
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:14,149
to reinforce what Sally said an answer

738
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:17,349
I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of these meetings</font>

739
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:20,119
that I sock has facilitated with

740
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:22,418
international policy makers at the IETF

741
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:25,099
and what Sally<font color="#E5E5E5"> just said is absolutely</font>

742
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:26,809
something I've seen up close and

743
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:30,369
personal many times now with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these folks</font>

744
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:33,229
where they realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet and</font>

745
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:36,168
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the Internet currently works is</font>

746
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:37,609
a tremendous tremendous benefit to them

747
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:39,469
and their countries in every way they

748
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:43,069
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it's an enormous economic</font>

749
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:45,229
and social benefit but because they have

750
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:47,329
these long-standing policies that have

751
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:49,339
Control regimes attached to them that

752
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:51,739
have fees and taxes attached to them

753
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:54,499
whether there can be really big revenue

754
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:56,209
implications for how you know some of

755
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:57,529
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some of the basic work</font>

756
00:31:56,209 --> 00:32:00,109
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments gets done with</font>

757
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:01,789
changing things they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

758
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:03,289
they're caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a bind they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

759
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,739
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're trapped between the</font>

760
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:08,839
benefits of the internet and these

761
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:10,489
policy based costs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know people</font>

762
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,779
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> us didn't take into account and</font>

763
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:14,389
frankly it's a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't or</font>

764
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:16,459
we wouldn't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as we have</font>

765
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:19,099
it today but these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> really do need</font>

766
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:22,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">to reconcile these competing and</font>

767
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:24,948
contending concerns and real information

768
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:28,039
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

769
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:30,019
compromises fit the technology together

770
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">with those policy concerns they're</font>

771
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:33,950
desperate<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it and they really do</font>

772
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:36,710
listen and really do change their

773
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:38,929
positions and for a like wicket

774
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,600
based on being told wait a minute you

775
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:42,830
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually work these things out but</font>

776
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do have to spend some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font>

777
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:49,330
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really understand the issues</font>

778
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:52,100
and cans and the contending priorities

779
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:53,629
yeah thanks for that and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

780
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:58,010
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> having been in this Internet</font>

781
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:59,990
Governance debate space for quite a

782
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,240
while now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fair to say that</font>

783
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:06,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the questions coming from governments</font>

784
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:09,080
are becoming more sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

785
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,710
they're deeper in terms of what they're

786
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,360
looking for which reflects<font color="#E5E5E5"> their I mean</font>

787
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,130
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a personal level it reflects</font>

788
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,860
more interaction with the technology

789
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,750
than we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen 5-10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

790
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,610
they're using skype they're using you

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,950
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are this is being integrated</font>

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,178
into their<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyday lives so the</font>

793
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,899
questions are becoming more

794
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:31,309
sophisticated and more challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

795
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:33,110
know one of the proposals going into

00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:38,059
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about was proposals that</font>

798
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:40,220
literally said the<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries have the</font>

799
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:42,500
right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how their internet</font>

800
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,899
traffic has been routed and the right to

801
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:49,250
regulate it in pursuance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of national</font>

802
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:51,260
objectives I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would have</font>

803
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,779
profound implications if anybody could

804
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,789
actually managed to implement that as a

805
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:57,890
practical matter but what they were

806
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:59,720
saying is is you know they're merging

807
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:04,270
this this thought process from the

808
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,830
telephony days into the internet and

809
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,989
saying if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it worked there it should work</font>

810
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,029
here I had the regulatory their

811
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:13,368
regulatory authority there I should have

812
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,169
the regulatory authority here and if I

813
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:17,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't I need to understand it as a</font>

814
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,489
technical matter why that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make</font>

815
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense and we had some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very I think</font>

816
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,259
productive conversations with people at

817
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:26,270
the last IETF meeting about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that very</font>

818
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,540
question where you know literally

819
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,609
drawing on on whiteboards and things and

820
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,580
saying this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things work had a</font>

821
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:38,480
real impact they<font color="#E5E5E5"> people wanted that</font>

822
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:41,199
information hi Daniel white with globe

823
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,340
net so glum it's a subsea cable operator

824
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,560
Krishna with wide bandwidth and

825
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll currently IP but have never really</font>

826
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,810
provided telecommunications really a

827
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,639
bandwidth provider so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

828
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,710
we're not currently subject to the

829
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">iTunes regulations and under the new</font>

830
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,660
regulations we would now be<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

831
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,100
under some sort of bind for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this how do</font>

832
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,600
they see those new regulations affecting

833
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,730
companies that are not currently telecom

834
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:09,730
companies but are heavily ip-based right

835
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:12,170
I think that's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big unanswered</font>

836
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:16,040
questions to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest coming out of</font>

837
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:21,470
wicked there was a very lengthy very

838
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:23,990
arcane<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate about the definitions in a</font>

839
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:26,390
treaty<font color="#E5E5E5"> the definitions are very</font>

840
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:29,629
important in any regulatory structure

841
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:31,370
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to define first that which you</font>

842
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:34,910
will regulate so you need to know what

843
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:37,069
it what the it is and in this case one

844
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,799
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions was what is the</font>

845
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:42,340
recognized operating agency that was the

846
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,560
term that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was used in 1988 to talk about</font>

847
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,870
clear telecommunications providers or

848
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,270
operators and there was quite a

849
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:52,549
significant debate about whether to

850
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:55,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">expand that to include all operating</font>

851
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,410
agencies which as we understood it would

852
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:02,779
have swept in anybody providing a

853
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:06,170
service to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public it was narrowed</font>

854
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:10,780
back from that broad approach but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

855
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:13,460
in true diplomatic form fudged a bit and

856
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:17,180
there's a question I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the legal</font>

857
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:20,990
community now about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take that</font>

858
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:24,049
language and interpret it to see to whom

859
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:26,689
it will apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other complicating</font>

860
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:31,010
factor is is that legal analysis may be

861
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:33,110
done in all 89 countries that signed the

862
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,780
treaty and they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly reach</font>

863
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:39,320
certain different conclusions so you

864
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:43,880
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a plethora of regulations</font>

865
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:46,130
which is you know fairly common so the

866
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,760
short answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ambiguous and we don't</font>

867
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,770
know for sure it's not as bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we had</font>

868
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,650
feared going in but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is not a</font>

869
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,980
clear-cut case that you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

870
00:36:54,650 --> 00:37:09,150
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> excluded</font>

871
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:11,750

876
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,920
you see or there's some committees

877
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,430

easily do this or well there's and

879

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:38,700
this point it's very government-driven

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's no one answer but if</font>

love to have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people get involved if</font>

936
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,920
your company is in a situation where

937
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,620
they can spare you to go to some of

938
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,810
these meetings and participate in

939
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:07,930
meetings predominantly of regulators but

940
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:12,100
also other ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carriers on the</font>

941
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:15,370
ground we'd welcome it so that's one way

942
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:19,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get involved thanks I think that's</font>

943
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:22,930
right in just the it's it's good to have

944
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:26,430
a most a repository<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experts that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

945
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:30,250
be drawn upon as John said there's a

946
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:31,990
plethora now of meetings and events and

947
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">which governments are asking these</font>

948
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:35,560
questions and there are a number a lot

949
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical community</font>

950
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,000
that are starting to step forward as

951
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,830
experts the more that step forward the

952
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,400
less of a burden it is on everybody we

953
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:48,730
can share the collective responsibility

954
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,370
and you will hear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it becomes</font>

955
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:53,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier after the first engagement of the</font>

956
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:55,480
second engagement you start to hear the

957
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:59,770
kinds of questions they<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

958
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,800
commonality in questions there's us that

959
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:06,700
that list that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had up earlier of the</font>

960
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,920
the concerns you know these kinds of

961
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions here are ones that we see over</font>

962
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,830
and over again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't the first time</font>

963
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,980
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it's certainly not the</font>

964
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">last so if you have expertise in a</font>

965
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,890
particular area

966
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,370
um you know engage with Aaron or engage

967
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:25,500
with with I can or a thigh sock you know

968
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:28,049
make make us aware that you have this

969
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,560
kind of expertise and are willing to to

970
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:34,830
be a resource the more resources we have

971
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,740
on the list of that we can tap into I

972
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:42,029
think the better so I have a question

973
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:45,330
from from chat this this will be a

974
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:46,890
little edgy but on the there there was

975
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:50,700
recently a petition going around to

976
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:54,170
defund the IV you yeah do I need to say

977
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:58,470
more no no do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

978
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:04,170
that's a complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue um I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

979
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:05,549
say as a first order the ITU is not some

980
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,090
of us are talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> over lunch it's</font>

981
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:11,970
not a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing on the IT does a lot</font>

982
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:13,710
of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things the itu-t which is</font>

983
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,080
the one many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us here probably</font>

984
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:19,740
interface with is not the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

985
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:22,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye to the radio communication</font>

986
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,689
sector is incredibly important for the

987
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:27,930
spectrum and radio communication work

988
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,370
that it does the development sector is a

989
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:33,390
thing that developing countries

990
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:36,120
worldwide trust for information so while

991
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:38,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think that that initiative it might</font>

992
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,190
feel good as an instinctive matter I

993
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,870
think the message from wicked is

994
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:46,410
different I think the message from

995
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:48,630
wicked is we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more engaged in</font>

996
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:52,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">the discussion we have to do more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

997
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:56,100
provide direction to the debate pulling

998
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:59,700
up and going home feels good temporarily

999
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:01,529
until this happens again and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one</font>

1000
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,290
of the complaints that we hear sometimes

1001
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,900
from developing countries is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1002
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,090
know the community whether it's

1003
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:12,030
developed countries or big companies or

1004
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:16,050
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> only show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up at the point of a</font>

1005
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:21,630
threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they don't deliver going</font>

1006
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward and so i'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that pulling</font>

1007
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:28,670
up and going home is is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

1008
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:28,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the narrative</font>

1021
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:03,760
form together for people like the folks

1022
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:07,510
in this room to volunteer for that kind

1023
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,220
of thing as not everybody has a ton of

1024
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,720
cycles to dedicate to going to

1025
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,120
additional meetings but certainly will

1026
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,759
volunteer to be called upon as various

1027
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:19,569
subject matter experts that's a great

1028
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea I think we could do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I also</font>

1029
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:25,060
think yeah the there's ways where you

1030
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:29,620
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to physically go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

1031
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:31,900
meeting we for example back this summer

1032
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:35,020
we're looking at the proposals that came

1033
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,480
from certain countries to introduce a

sending party network<font color="#E5E5E5"> pays concept into</font>

1035
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,910
the treaty so that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> centers of</font>

1036
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:47,020
traffic would pay to to have their

1037
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:52,450
traffic delivered it took a think a

1038
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:54,970
community effort to really analyze what

1039
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:57,339
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proposal would mean and so</font>

1040
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,350
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people who can't get on an</font>

putting heads together electronically to

1044
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,569
think through some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

1045
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write things and to contribute to</font>

1047
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,340
exercise and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helps to bolster</font>

1048
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:26,320
the the information that countries that

1051
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:31,660

00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:33,540
attendance at meetings there's also the

1053
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:37,930
you know bringing information to bear

1054
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:42,589
for people like me who<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to these</font>

1055
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:44,960
meetings on a daily or monthly basis

1061
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:59,900
that the State Department actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

1062
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:02,210
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coordination for these</font>

1063
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,979
agencies and there's open mailing lists

1064
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:06,380
they're open for subject matter experts

1065
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:08,118
such as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> itec list and other things</font>

1066
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,279
so if you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> help getting in touch</font>

1067
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,930
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> secretariat of the list I'll</font>

1068
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:14,299
extend the same offer i did in<font color="#E5E5E5"> dallas</font>

1069
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm happy to make introductions to you</font>

1070
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:21,019
know for people in the community<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

1071
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:22,219
red hair so I'm easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find so aside</font>

1072
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:23,718
from that you know if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1073
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in participating in this</font>

1074
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:26,960
state department is always interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1075
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,140
doing this there's conference calls

1076
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,809
pretty regularly as well and you know I

1077
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,819
you know including you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-planning</font>

1078
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:36,859
conference calls that that preceded

1079
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:39,410
wicket as well that went out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> itec</font>

1080
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:41,869
list and other things so it's definitely

1081
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,430
a valuable<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to engage or if you</font>

1082
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:46,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a government relations person to</font>

1083
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,680
engage but even in the absence of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1084
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:51,380
do recommend that you you do participate

1085
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,089
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can participate in some ways as an</font>

1086
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,920
individual but a lot of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1087
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:57,049
state to state relationships as well so

1088
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,789
it gets a little complex so you have to

1089
00:46:57,049 --> 00:47:01,059
pay a little attention to the nuances

1090
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:04,099
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy to make introductions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1091
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:06,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">think to that point I'll just we have a</font>

1092
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:11,930
mailing list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sock as well that is</font>

1093
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:14,660
is more for global individual members or

1094
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:16,430
corporate members or whatever and that's

1095
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:19,578
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a fruitful dialogue so</font>

1096
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:21,469
that a stakeholder in Kenya can ask a

1097
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:25,849
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the list and you know people</font>

1098
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:30,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Australia or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US can can help</font>

1099
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:32,660
respond to that to that point it is a

1100
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:35,569
point of encouragement I think it wicked

1101
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:38,739
that we did see a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

1102
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:42,319
experts or people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the community on</font>

1103
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:44,359
national delegations to the wicket for

1104
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:46,549
some of them it was a new and<font color="#CCCCCC"> great it</font>

1105
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:48,200
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brave new world coming into Dubai</font>

1106
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:50,269
where you know people are raising yellow

1107
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,328
paddles to vote and things like that but

1108
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:54,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of engagement on national</font>

1109
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:57,309
delegations was incredible

1110
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:00,829
important and something in all my time

1111
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:03,530
doing this kind of international<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

1112
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:04,790
work I've never<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen before and I think</font>

1113
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,559
that was because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of</font>

1114
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,540
attention the level of concern that was

1115
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,900
going into wicket but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1116
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:13,970
that we shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow to drop off if</font>

1117
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,430
we can participate in national

1118
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:18,410
delegations like the US or others Sweden

1119
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,450
had some experts in the Netherlands

1120
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kenya Philippines there are a lot of</font>

1121
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,629
countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

1122
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:26,598
community into their delegations we

1123
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:30,500
should maintain that momentum to the

1124
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:32,000
extent that we can Patrick as always

1125

00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:01,940
good to pump millions of dollars as

1138
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,020
small as that sounds to the United

our faces pulled stunts that anywhere

00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:18,348
would be considered shameful and does

1145
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,359
nothing that we want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and does</font>

1146

lots and lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we want</font>

1147
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:25,160
them not to do so in my opinion yeah

1148
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,980
pull your toys go home for that
