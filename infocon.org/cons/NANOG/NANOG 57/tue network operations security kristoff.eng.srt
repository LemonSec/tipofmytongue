IP address on a packet that leaves your

us from an even worse set of problems

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,639
related to source IP spoofing now the

62
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,500
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was great back then is</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these boxes were generally megabit</font>

65
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,359
day and so even though these boxes had

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,280
terrible sis's men they didn't have a

67
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,980
whole lot of computing horsepower you

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,810
had to really gang 10,000 of them

<font color="#E5E5E5">together to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get enough packets to really</font>

70
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:37,560
hurt somebody not that 10,000 was a hard

71
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,138
problem but things have<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed now we</font>

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,299
have the cloud we have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

virtual hosting clouds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't mean</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but you can now order a Linux VM</font>

from anybody and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will push a button</font>

77
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,549
and clone that vm for you tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:11,190
are as poorly<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and as the old</font>

been pressed and you got your clone you

85
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,609
would stop getting any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of updates</font>

86
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,130
in particular to something called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joomla</font>

87
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:22,799
or PHP BB or anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,570
allow bad people to come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> use your</font>

computer for their purposes instead of

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,909
just for yours and these tend to be

91
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:32,940
gigabit connected there are millions of

92
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:34,710
them don't downplay this problem you can

93
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,719
now get enough horsepower from enough

94
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,940
different clouds that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't strictly</font>

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
even need to reflect off of anybody you

<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font>

97
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,830
and bury someone in traffic that they

00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:48,628
did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> solicit and cannot stop just by</font>

spoofing some other address and fire

00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:56,099
bombing them directly apologize for all

101
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,199
these pop-ups so in other words the

102
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:01,050
problem has recently gotten much much

103
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,060
worse and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the cloud owners</font>

104
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,250
will tell you yeah we gave that<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy the</font>

105
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,259
root password we cannot now reach past

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,150
him and update his software for him and

107
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,129
we understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's not smart enough</font>

108
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,239
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it but you know will pass your</font>

109
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:14,639
complaint to him but you won't

110
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand that's that's the direction</font>

111
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,520
we're moving so in the future this

112
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,229
projector will since it has an IP

113
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,539
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> will no doubt have malware</font>

114
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:27,199
running in it because you've all heard

115
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:30,779
about SCADA industrial control systems

116
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:35,340
getting default passwords running telnet

117

<font color="#CCCCCC">or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the idea behind these boxes</font>

118
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:42,719
is volume and at scale security gets

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,599
lost in the noise let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> plain a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:47,909
bit about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again this tends to</font>

be your dns server<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to explain</font>

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:56,699
half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk right I don't know</font>

124
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,240
what we were thinking UDP in the white

125
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,889
area is crazy it works fine for NFS or

126
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,599
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in your land or on</font>

127
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,279
your campus but I don't know what the

128
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,080
heck we were thinking creating a

129
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,669
protocol like DNS and expecting the

130
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,979
whole world to run it and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:17,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem I really don't know about DNS</font>

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:20,550
SEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> because some complete moron wrote an</font>

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,919
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accommodate the gigantic</font>

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:35,128
especially negative responses so we were

139
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,839
crazy we're hurting from it we could

140
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:42,000
have seen this coming now<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to that</font>

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sales of smartphones and</font>

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,949
whatnot go up if it has flashing moving

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,589
things on it that you can press and so

144
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,680
forth and that means apps that means

145
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:53,810
pulling data over the network

146
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,030
promoting it code and executing it in

00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,820
some form like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java flash activex</font>

thinking because every one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

150
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:07,669
had all kinds of problems where the

executable data gets corrupted or is

152
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:12,590
deliberately corrupted by its creator

153
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:16,280
and then collapse your box soon it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

co-op to your refrigerator and lastly

155
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,008
you can't expect somebody to be assisted

156
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,889
in I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the iOS devices</font>

157
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,660
iPhones and whatnot get this better but

158
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,340
thinking that PC Mac cloud server

160

that your mom is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit at home</font>

that's not realistic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really could</font>

do what I'm saying the default should be

186

don't do that you know keep people from

for this on the dns server side and like

206

all fixes it's not perfect and and yet

207
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:31,300
it is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty darn well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

208
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:33,160
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is an actual demo</font>

209
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,609
on my actual recursive server what

210
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,800
you've seen is a burst of 25 requests

211
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:43,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telling The Dig command don't</font>

212
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,859
fall back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a TCP session and a bunch</font>

213
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,500
of other things don't retry and so forth

214
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:50,380
because if you let dig work normally

215
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,810
then it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout and retry and if it</font>

216
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,820
gets a truncated response it will retry

217
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,219
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and so forth so without all</font>

218
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,800
these fancy options you just get 25

219
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,900
decent answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> even from my server so i</font>

220
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,240
had to in order to demonstrate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

221
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,699
dropping some of these of this burst<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

222
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,310
had to turn on these extra options and

223
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:13,180
all this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 25</font>

224
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:16,449
times we ended up with three truncated

225
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:19,420
responses to if you set the TC bit that

226
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,040
tells the questioner yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't have</font>

227
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,199
room in the packet for everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

228
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,849
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say to you so if you didn't</font>

229
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">get enough which they want from us</font>

230
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,800
because it's a zero-length response then

231
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,290
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> try again with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp this is</font>

232
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">dangerous because tcp is three round</font>

233
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,740
trips and seven packets and a lot of

234
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">state on both sides and it will not</font>

235
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,780
scale so you can't be doing this all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

236
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,089
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it statistically so</font>

237
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,189
we have a mixture in<font color="#CCCCCC"> rrl response rate</font>

238
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,230
limiting we have a mixture of setting

239
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,540
the TC bit on some things and dropping

240
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,640
some things and the result is that you

241
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,910
get no actual loss you get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,680
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra delay if that particular person</font>

245
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,970
in the config file<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm simply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stating</font>

246
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,339
hear that

247
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,800
remember five seconds of history for

248
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:11,589
anybody who has exceeded the when the

249
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,649
maximum of<font color="#E5E5E5"> five responses per second now</font>

250
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,230
to be a response means not just that you

251
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:21,009
your IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me something it's</font>

252
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:23,259
an IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to yours bucket</font>

254
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:27,550
usually that's the default an IP address

255
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,350
similar to yours has asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a question</font>

256
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,550
that had an answer similar to the one

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about giving you</font>

258
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,329
because otherwise somebody could just

259
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,180
randomly pick you know random<font color="#E5E5E5"> string</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">calm oh and another random string calm</font>

261
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,489

<font color="#E5E5E5">a unique reply and you would not</font>

263
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,629
necessarily be able to detect that as a

flow but<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our point of view a</font>

265
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:52,870
negative response is actually a response

266
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:54,639
from the apex so if I ask random string

267
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,079
calm and I get a negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer we</font>

268

treat that as a negative answer from

269
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:03,790
calm we ignore that the random strength

270
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:08,079
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen negative impact on</font>

is lower than the average time of the

telling your current dns server provider

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll explain why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this has to be done</font>

427
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,620
as a response rate limiter not as a

428
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,730
request<font color="#E5E5E5"> or client IP flow limit but so</font>

429
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,739
far they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones who have</font>

430
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,360
picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on this but I know that once</font>

431
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,059
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them cells that the others are</font>

432
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,279
all going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start losing rfps and then</font>

433
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:41,629
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to implement it also thank</font>

434
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:43,159
you hi Jim shank from to come ur e have

435
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,020
you given thought to the possibility of

436
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,149
this being used as a denial of service

437
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,299
attack to keep domains down and not

438
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:52,908
propagating by spoofing a address<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a /</font>

439
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:57,049
24 as a source and not allowing the

440
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:59,480
answers back yes we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

441
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:02,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in no case would we ever make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

442
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,250
situation worse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew Sullivan has</font>

443
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,899
taken the time to point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

444
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,510
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one case where it gets worse and</font>

445
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:10,309
that's where the TTL is so low that the

446
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,250
total transaction time that we can

447
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,370
induce if there's a retrying a timeout

448
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,899
retry or have you retry with TCP is

449
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:20,149
larger than the TTL that's that's the

450
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:22,668
problem but in the normal case where the

451
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:24,949
TTL is an hour or a day<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whatever we</font>

452
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:28,909
normally use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ttls the answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

453
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:31,779
because the real client is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

454
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:34,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting some of our answers</font>

455
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:37,389
and our answers are a mixture of the

456
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:39,840
real answer a timeout which<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

457
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:43,389
the client will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a timeout and a</font>

458
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,158
TC equal one response if they get the

459
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:46,539
real answer they're satisfied if they

460
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,940
get a timeout they're going to retry

461
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:50,289
usually two more times they get a

462
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,889
truncation they're going to retry with

463
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:56,049
TCP<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if the channel is so congested</font>

464
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:57,820
that their queries are being lost and

465
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:59,649
they can't successfully retry that's a

466
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,539
problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we came here to solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

467
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:04,149

don't solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other two</font>

00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:07,899
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it worse if</font>

470
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,419
somebody is spoofing your IP address

00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:12,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking his server for a certain name and</font>

00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:15,570
he's running rrl he will<font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually stop</font>

473
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,159
answering that question if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask it</font>

474
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,989
but you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very happy that he didn't</font>

475
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,369
congest your upstream link with all of

the responses that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise</font>

478
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:28,299
increases the chances of you hearing one

<font color="#CCCCCC">have it you'll keep it sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is</font>

483
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:38,589
yes we thought a lot about that but

484
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:41,080
using the bit masking for matching on

485
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:43,839
the source if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I choose an address that's</font>

the DNS resolver that I'm wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

488
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,789
block a domain from being resolvable

489
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:55,089
from then wouldn't it be possible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

490
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:58,649
to keep a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain from being</font>

491
00:20:55,089 --> 00:21:01,299
resolvable from a particular resolver by

492
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:03,939
spoofing an address that's in the same /

493
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,830
24 and keep asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question that that</font>

494
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:10,419
server would then not cash because it's

495
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:13,449
not receiving it so it wouldn't matter

496
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:16,239
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you picked one off IP address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or pick</font>

suppress responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

499
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,149
do is transform an amplifier into an

00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:24,489
attenuator that means we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

501
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:27,218
drop some responses all together and

we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn others into TC equal</font>

server

509
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:54,000
and that frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good enough for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

510
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:55,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks yeah the one of the thing to</font>

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,900
keep in mind here is the scaling of this

that doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> processing to do the</font>

515
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,940
debating what this is useful that's very

516
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,820
useful but the consideration areas it's

517
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,510
taking time out of your runtime

518
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,860

519
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:15,780
shifting the attack now from yeah but do

520
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,309
you have any thoughts about what do you

521
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,120
think are the scaling bottlenecks what

522
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,770
do you think is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a thing that</font>

523

<font color="#E5E5E5">goes at some point you're going to have</font>

524
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,760
so much traffic or what what do you

525
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">think would make what could blow this</font>

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,240
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of water basically is what do you</font>

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,899
think I'm asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> genuine</font>

curiosity not sure if i'ma so the

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,490
additional resources that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will use</font>

if you're running a rate-limiting are

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,270
the other guy retrying and more often<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

532
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:42,179
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> network load that you're</font>

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,190
incurring you using more<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu time to</font>

534
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,380
make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision and you using more</font>

535
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,650
memory to keep track of what the IP

536
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,419
block has asked for what thing recently

537
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,799
we limited all of that to the extent

538
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:58,530
possible and it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be perfect</font>

539
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:01,679
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can on a server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was receiving</font>

540
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:04,399
like 50,000 queries a second each<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

541
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,990
unique IP each asking for a unique name

542
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,660
the total amount of additional heat

543
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,600
space that we will require is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

544
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,610
of megabytes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you know servers</font>

545
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,399
that get a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand per second</font>

546
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,799
are not getting from unique queries or

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,919
unique IPS to unique names so that

548
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">really is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst case and for the CPU</font>

549
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:27,000
we don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> marshal at least in</font>

550
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,100
the bind implementation of our RL we

551
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,630
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> marshal the response right once</font>

552
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,610
we've known what the response would be

553
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,900
that's when we check<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if there's a</font>

554
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,330
bucket open for this and if we've

555
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,669
exceeded its quota and that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

556
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,620
in any case where we are suppressing a

557
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,720
response we are also avoiding the cost

558
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,889
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> marshalling that response and that</font>

559
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,500
marshalling cost is much higher than our

00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,210
dropping<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost so it does it does mean we</font>

561
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,400
have an additional fixed cost on the

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,970
responses<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't drop but I'm not</font>

worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

564
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,970
in terms of actual server<font color="#CCCCCC"> Headroom you</font>

570
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:15,300
just we we wanted to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we</font>

571
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:18,990
weren't creating a resource vector to

572
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:21,629
trade out for the old vector Michael

573
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,040
Michael Sinatra yes then you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,320
last by the way I'm Way over the time

575
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,090
okay just<font color="#E5E5E5"> two I'll be very quick then</font>

576
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,439
just to address briefly Ed's comment in

577
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:36,689
experience running this while under

578
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,430
attack the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with cpu and</font>

579
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,020
with server utilization is actually when

580
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,220
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do query logging while</font>

581
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,210
you're under one of these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

582
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,500
while you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used as one of these</font>

583
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,240
reflectors if you're trying to query log

584
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:50,340
a syslog that's going to take up a lot

585
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:52,140
more resource than running rrl and the

586
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,470
other point to make is as someone who's

587
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,660
experienced being a reflector this is

588
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:59,330
the best way to handle it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that</font>

589
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,370
i know of with no with very little

590
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,649
collateral damage and everyone i think

591
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,320
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at this</font>

592
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:09,060
stuff because you either have had this

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen to you you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have it</font>

happen to you or it is happening to you

595
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,100
right now there aren't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many other</font>

596
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,110
categories unless you simply don't run

00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,669
an authoritative name server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

598
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,620
didn't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll add on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of people have turned this on not</font>

602
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,180
because they thought they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were under</font>

603
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,680
attack but because somebody told them

604
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,780
this was a public health thing that they

605
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,310
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered they</font>

606
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,050
had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> under attack they just hadn't</font>

607
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:37,050
noticed it before but you know I've seen

608
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,610
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen traffic graphs that say</font>

609
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,830
yeah this is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to have to send</font>

610
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">five megabits of constant response</font>

611
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,949
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> five megabits is not very much</font>

612
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,050
by the standards of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

613
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,670
room it was a lot to that guy he thought

614
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was necessary and it turned out that</font>

615
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,270
actually about a half a megabit was all

616
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,540
that was necessary and the rest was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

617
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:57,000
to drop so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find that</font>

618
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,510
there's a lot more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this going on than</font>

619
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,590
anybody knew so thank you all I'm sorry

620
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">for these overtime that's great</font>

621
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright I'm going to present something</font>

622
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:23,390
that is on behalf of somebody else real

623
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:29,570
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Larry and David</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o has both you</font>

624
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:32,300
to come up shortly Daniel Clemens and I

625
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,800
had a discussion about some work that he

626
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,510
had forwarded to me just sort of on a

627
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,560
whim I think and I took a look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

628
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,670
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting and I</font>

629
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,669
said why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come to nana I can</font>

630
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,840
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he he wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to but</font>

631
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,520
he could make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so he said why don't</font>

632
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go ahead and do this one day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half so</font>

633
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,270
basically the system some work that him

634
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,000
and his colleague exact date and had

635
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:52,460
done about a year maybe a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

636
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,310
half ago taking a look at who

637
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">anonymous's what are they all about how</font>

638
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,629
to monitor them and the tools that they

639
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,950
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> in analyzing those tools so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

640
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,390
going to kind of summarize for you this

641
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,980
white paper that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wrote and I don't</font>

642
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,800
have permission to distribute this white

643
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,780
paper if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I even going under the</font>

644
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,250
oppression that any of you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could</font>

645
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it you just have to ask him so if</font>

646
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this seems interesting to you either ask</font>

647
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,470
me later or write down this email<font color="#CCCCCC"> dress</font>

648
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">small have people have we put in touch</font>

649
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:21,980
with him I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind</font>

650
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of quickly in the name of time but if</font>

651
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,590
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who I hope are very few are</font>

652
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,060
familiar with anonymous I mean they're

653
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,830
their modus operandi is pretty

654
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,970
straightforward most people consider

655
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,620
them at<font color="#CCCCCC"> disa that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our heck to this</font>

656
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,260
operation who really took prominence a

657
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,120
few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when Tom Cruise was in</font>

658
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,340
this video on YouTube that just kind of

659
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,800
went viral and when YouTube took it down

660
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:45,290
at the request of church of scientology

661
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,669
group of folks can when nuts about that

662
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,800
and thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some sort of</font>

663
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,510
violation of their writer freedom to the

664
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">post this material and so they started</font>

665
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:57,050
watching all sorts of interesting and

666
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:01,760
very often malicious protests and

667
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:03,860
attacks against that group and then from

668
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,810
from there they just their popularity

669
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,040
continued to rise as more people sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

670
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,840
join the group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they took on</font>

671
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">so-called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operations and there's a</font>

672
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,499
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them undoubtedly</font>

673
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:13,269
many of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard of some of these</font>

674
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:15,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks and so this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a</font>

675
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:19,200
brief snapshot of a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those that</font>

676
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:19,200
I just wanted to list for you here

677
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:24,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">Daniels work what I found most</font>

678
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,289
interesting about it is he essentially

679
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:29,739
him as colleague since<font color="#E5E5E5"> she went through</font>

680
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:32,408
almost 40 pieces of software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

681
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:35,440
examined them mostly from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point of</font>

682
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:38,649
standpoint of source code and try to

683
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,729
identify ways to fingerprint the attacks

684
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:43,748
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would generate and so I found</font>

685
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,830
this really interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

686
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really potentially useful</font>

687
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,949
information for anyone who's

688
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:51,190
particularly on the receiving end of

689
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:54,669
that attack and so they built signatures

690
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,989
for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of stuff mainly the tools</font>

691
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:58,899
that they were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at we're focused</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this low orbit ion cannon stuff but</font>

693
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:03,728
some of you may have seen started as a

694
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:05,409
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows application that which</font>

695
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:07,839
essentially blast packets and had a few

696
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:12,159
parameters on what to actually stand for

697
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:13,960
traffic they built snorts the signatures

698
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,580
because they felt that that was either

699
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,769
who they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing this for or</font>

700
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,218
perhaps based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their experience that</font>

701
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:23,349
was most convenient<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

reading this stuff however that may not

00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:27,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">be entirely applicable to many people in</font>

706
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,009
runs snort in line and some of your 10

707
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:35,049
giggling so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work</font>

708
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:36,609
so in essence many of these signatures

709
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:38,049
just aren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work for many of</font>

710
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:40,449
you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these would be pushed perhaps</font>

711
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:42,158
towards the edge and I took it look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

712
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,570
one tool to see if there were things

713
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,529
that you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement it like a</font>

714
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:49,509
simple ACL and the one I looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

715
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:51,219
examples slow loris and I didn't see

716
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:52,570
anything really obvious to me like that

717
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:54,129
you could do like I'm layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

718
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,960
earlier for that would but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

719
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:58,178
this summer sorts of things that they

720
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,129
had done the thing that also stood out

721
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,969
was that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks generated from</font>

722
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:04,059
these tools that they were doing

723
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:05,859
signatures on was largely based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

724
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:07,389
default use case of these tools so

725
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you download this tool and you</font>

726
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,359
run it and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> signatures based on</font>

727
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:12,249
the default parameters of that tool

728
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,918
which are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty dumb there's</font>

729
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:16,749
all sorts of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you've been hacked</font>

730
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,729
kind of strings in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack</font>

731
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:21,039
payload itself and those sorts of things

732
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:22,500
that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to filter on if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

733
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that deep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> package</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Shin capability and if the attacker</font>

735
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,750
isn't actually changing anything about

736
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,090
the configure the tools so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

737
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,800
limitations<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the signatures that</font>

738
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,449
they've created but presumably in

739
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,970
practice that doesn't happen all that

740
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:38,970
often here's just a quick screenshot of

741
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:41,430
one of the JavaScript based on Kanin

742
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,870
stuff and below that is a sample

743
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,130
signature and I don't intend<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you to</font>

744
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually read that but that's just going</font>

745
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say so that's essentially if they</font>

746
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,709
didn't they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find any back doors</font>

747
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,330
and they did they weren't able to do

748
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,560
complete attribution to who wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

few<font color="#E5E5E5"> breadcrumbs for some interesting</font>

751
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,629

752
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,270

<font color="#CCCCCC">more of this sort of thing you can</font>

755
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,930
might just refer you back to them so

756
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,220
that's that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

758
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,160
I have one more a brief thing and then

759
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:21,450
I'll maybe I'll start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> David because</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the things that Paul was just talking</font>

768
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,960
amplification reflection attack that's

769
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:52,590
going on in the wild practically all the

770
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,950
time at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least every day I see some</font>

771
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,570
evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are happening in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

772
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,520
view of the world is relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited</font>

773
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,929
and some of you have much bigger views

774
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,300
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and so you presumably you</font>

775
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">would see even more than I would the</font>

776
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,500
idea is that you send in some type of

777
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,120
any query to a server and you'll get a

778
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,710
response when you send in any query you

779
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,600
get basically anything that that server

780
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,520
can tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that query name</font>

781
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,949
whether it's an MX record<font color="#E5E5E5"> types record a</font>

782
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:20,940
record a quad aid all the Guinness SEC

783
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:22,260
record types and usually or often that

784
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,820
response would be quite large and so

785
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,980
that's the amplification so you couple

786
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,600
that with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the smoothing</font>

787
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,820
capability that some networks still

788
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,620
provide for and then you have that

789
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,870
reflection piece

790
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:38,169
these have been going out for at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

791
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:40,090
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years now specifically in any</font>

792
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,350
attacks and I've asked a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

793
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,760
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's anyone figured out you</font>

794
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,219
know who's doing this what's the code

795
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,500
that's actually being run to enable

796
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,059
these and no<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's seems far as i can</font>

797
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,220
tell knows the answer to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

798
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:54,850
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting sick of not knowing</font>

799
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,380
so well I'm not personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> indirectly</font>

800
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,870
being harmed necessarily by these

801
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,730
attacks directly I'm just interesting

802
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,530
and figuring that out so I'm trying to

803
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure that out and at the end you'll</font>

804
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,860
note that i'm asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any assistance</font>

805
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some of you I know could help</font>

806
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:12,219
provide so I essentially said all the

we do see often is the in any queries

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:23,170
tend to use a handful of<font color="#E5E5E5"> q names career</font>

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,300
names often<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sea Org they provide</font>

811
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,770
a large response for an inquiry right

812
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,419
that's another popular one but we've

813
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:31,150
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> others but those are the two</font>

814
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:35,800
most well-known ones are the most common

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:38,890
ones as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been looking at this last</font>

few weeks I've in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the so that the</font>

817
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,420
evidence that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've gotten quite a few of</font>

818
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:45,490
these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> while they've been widely</font>

819
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,679
reported in the operator community the

operators being the DNS operators

821

<font color="#CCCCCC">servers are errors I'm also seeing</font>

822
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,110
evidence that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these attached</font>

823
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,890
are actually geared towards gaming

824
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:58,419
servers and at least one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the or a</font>

825
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,710
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the attacks seem to be</font>

particular types of gaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> server which</font>

00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,550
counter strike for example seems to be

828
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,309
one that's getting hit with these so

829
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:09,460
that's some clue perhaps to you know

830
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:10,840
who's involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff the</font>

831
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,449

00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,550
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually related or not yet but</font>

833
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:17,560
it's awfully suspicious is we also see

834
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,870
query names for simply rude so now is

835
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:23,739
the org or any and I don't know that

836
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:26,469
this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tack backscatter or not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see</font>

837
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:28,418
these queries essentially being spread

838
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:30,668
all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net so I'm getting queries</font>

839

all the address space that I have

840
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:35,259
visibility into and I don't know if this

841
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone simply scanning for name</font>

842
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,980
servers that will respond to in any

843
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,030
queries and if they get a response or if

844
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,840
it literally is backscatter traffic

845
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:48,380
attack so this may be a completely

846
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,450
separate thing to investigate but if

847
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,980
they're related investigating<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

848
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:54,589
long thing at the same time that in the

849
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:59,060
hopes that this will lead me<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

850
00:34:54,590 --> 00:35:00,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so how do you mitigate this stuff</font>

851
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,020
well obviously Paul talked about RL

852
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,730
which is very popular anyway any

853
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,310
networks who do aunty spoofing is a

854
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,480
problem I in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to people here</font>

855
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,860
this week who have admitted that you

856
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,020
know you can't always doing exploiting

857
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,320
filters for various reasons that some of

858
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,150
you I'm sure aware one of the things

859
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not an assay mitigation technique</font>

860
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,410
but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps of a reactive</font>

861
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,360
approach is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out where this</font>

862
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,819
stuff is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from based on what I've</font>

863
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,520
seen so far I'm led to believe although

864
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:30,440
I can't prove inclusively is that many

866
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,960
well distributed they may be coming just

867
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:40,100
from a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of networks that of</font>

868
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,610
course allow spoofing and therefore

869
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:45,259
there may be a small handful of networks

870
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:48,680
who are the ones that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

871
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,300
and beat down with the hammer or get

872
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,490
attention of so that they can help us

you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in helping or if</font>

00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,359
would be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know so come find</font>

uniform so any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions about this</font>

916
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,080
stuff come up to the mic and I'll let

David if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up and start</font>

920
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,570
get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the medications I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

921
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,940
submitted a lightning talk which I

922
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:46,800
haven't heard back on where when the

923
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,500
mitigations that we had been looking at

924
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,220
is trying to actually kind of change the

925
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,860
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in a way by just dying</font>

926
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,509
access to any queries under UDP night

927
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to save you the entire detail</font>

928
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,780
abide light and talk but that's another

929
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,400
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say we're just not going to</font>

930
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,770
answer anything that comes over UDP for

931
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,420
any and we can argue about good or bad

932
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,570
but there's a lot of fall behind it but

933
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,910
I data to a mitigation but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't it</font>

934
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,200
the problem is it could business I have

935
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in any query that just happens to</font>

936
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,020
be the one that's actively being abused

937
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,790
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I we can go into the</font>

938
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,670
rationale but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing I was</font>

939
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:22,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to add was when preparing my</font>

940
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,210
slides I went and asked some folks about

941
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the background so we were looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at one</font>

942
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,740
particular attack that was talked about

00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,359
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last nanog that the one one of the</font>

944
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,700
any query attacks we talked up there was

945
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,400
the ball the security track whatever

946
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:39,290
last time and i was told that since then

947
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:42,000
we have seen the any query attacks just

948
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,710
proliferate in not an unrelated ways

949
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,270
they're just a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of any and</font>

950
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">main different ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to attack servers so</font>

951
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:50,640
it's become more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Republic Ross the board</font>

952
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,470
not just one particular use one

953
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,200
particular case one pickle incident it

954
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,490
just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like more more bad actors are</font>

955
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,950
using it in different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

956
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,089
different things well the same thing and

957
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,609
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were part of our</font>

958
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,020
rationale behind looking at has the any

959
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:07,380
query become a tool

960
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:09,360
only before<font color="#E5E5E5"> not many people used it it</font>

961
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,890
was low now it's a big part of our

962
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,350
traffic it's all bad traffic so maybe

963
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,129
it's time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we should really</font>

964
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:18,660
different gate put it away so that

965
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:20,340
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a longer discussion Michael</font>

966
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sandra yes that the bad guys have</font>

967
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">already started using other queries even</font>

968
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,090
in mid attack we saw them switch from

969
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,460
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our our sake for a particular</font>

970

domain that had our our<font color="#CCCCCC"> sigs in it now</font>

00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,930
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> our sigs an easy one to go</font>

972
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,110
after because it's big but they'll find

973
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:39,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">something else to do and and related to</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too is I a couple of cases I've</font>

number large number of zones that that

980
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,170
clearly someone who's targeting because

981
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,990
they have to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have their</font>

currently very aware of how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> aim these</font>

changing pcs here Darren we we had an

idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to do like some</font>

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,060
track would do and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

989
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,130
are interested in sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting people</font>

990
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,080
in the security community sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

991
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,610
get in the secret handshake clubs so one

992
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,960
approach to do that is have people sort

993
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up and introduce themselves say</font>

994
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,670
a little bit who they are who they

995
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:34,950
represent what they need help with on

996
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,970
occasional what they can help with so

997
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,259
Darren was one of the ones that I've

998
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,779
talked to you about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was going to</font>

999
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,640
do be the guinea pigs<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stand up and do</font>

1000
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">this sure I'll do it so I'm Darren</font>

1002
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,649
Jared at ntt so I manages security team

1003
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,390
so I'm actually won the operational side

1004
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,950
of it where<font color="#E5E5E5"> jared is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the development guy</font>

1005
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,950

1007
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:01,430
yes 2914 if you have any problems feel

1008
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,430
free to Kentucky me

web app security person higher up the

1012
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,290
stack and we've started finding cases

1013
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,240
where it doesn't matter how much we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1014
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,990
some of those issues right so I'm here

1015
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,979
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for interactions and advice on</font>

1016
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:28,250
getting things right at other levels of

1017
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,250
the stack

1018
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:40,680
hello my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Eric rose and I'm of</font>

1020
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:56,038
I just came<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to meet new people and</font>

1021
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:58,439

1024
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:10,260
the attacks I'm here I'm David Barack

1025
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,970
with AT&T consulting and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

1026
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,829
a little bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the sensor</font>

1027
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,959
networking concerns we've we've run

1028
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:20,789
across in some of the in some of the

1029
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:23,069
edge network deployments so some of you

1030
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:24,450
have some of you are involved in

1031
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:26,880
deploying sensor networks and some of

1032
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:29,759
you or not so just a quick overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1033
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,010
what sensor networks are basically these

1034
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,269
are these are the these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the things</font>

1035
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,529
when they talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the network of</font>

1036
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:38,759
the future the Internet of Things and

1037
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:41,190
things like that that's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font>

1038
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,160
the real examples of this are your smart

1039
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:47,849
warehouse where every toothbrush has an

1040
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">origin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ship in it or where every palate</font>

1041
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:54,269
of toothbrushes has has our kids in more

1042
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:56,069
or every or the smart meters on every

1043
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:59,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">power grid that weird thing on the power</font>

1044
00:42:56,069 --> 00:43:02,910
grid<font color="#E5E5E5"> or things like that they these</font>

1045
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:04,559
often are multicast multicast users or

1046
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,710
should say multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources and</font>

1047
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,650
receivers often the entire communication

1048
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:14,759
path is largely multicast this cause

1049
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:16,740
this can cause some very specific issues

1050
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:18,839
one of the in one of the reasons for

1051
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">using multicast in that context because</font>

1052
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:24,180
you have so many possible sources you

1053
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,700
know if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every every</font>

1054
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,740
tooth brush in a walmart right or more

1055
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Walmart warehouse</font>

1056
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,950
every toothbrush that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1057
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,319
toothbrushes so if you can if you can

1058
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,848
send if you can track them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all with you</font>

1059
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,038
know send one multicast and then they

1060
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:39,450
all get it right then that's that's a

1061
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:40,650
lot better than having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to individually</font>

1062
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,009
send the packet that every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1063
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:47,700
saying are you still there

1064
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:49,260
so the the in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sensor</font>

1065
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,029
networks do tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be machine</font>

1066
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,760
communication to other machines and not

1067
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,110
directly for people the process there

1068
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:04,140
will be processing and then it goes to

1069
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:05,850
people and the also anybody I'm certain

1070
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">there other public transit users in in</font>

1071
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:11,670
the room by the many of the public

1072
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:14,100
transit next bus utilities are enabled

1073
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,870
with sort of a almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a degenerate case</font>

1074
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,610
of sensor networking I mean you could

1075
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:19,500
that could that could be effectively an

1076
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:22,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">iPhone on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bus right I mean it could be</font>

1077
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,990
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that simple but it but it more</font>

1078
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,340
elaborate case can involve sensors that

1079
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,109
are put around and put around the city

1080
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:31,410
and it tracks where it is based on

1081
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:33,210
proximity things like that so smart

1082
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:37,020
smart power grids are the interesting

1083
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:40,890
are an interesting case and and to look

1084
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:43,740
at at an example I wanted to use the one

1085
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">at use orlando and just as i have not</font>

1086
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">been involved in the deployment of the</font>

1087
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,259
smart power grid in orlando so it's it

1088
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,810
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just as a case study to give</font>

1089
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,980
you to give you the the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> and scale</font>

1090
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,620
of what you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at and where the</font>

1091
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,090
possible security threats are and these

1092
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">are representative of what we've seen in</font>

1093
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">other contexts so there are 238 k people</font>

1094
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,960
in orlando and there are approximately

1095
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:07,230
121 k homes that does include

1096
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-family multi-family homes if you</font>

1097
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,750
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if you take out the</font>

1098
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-family homes you're talking about</font>

1099
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:21,530
it approximately 500 sorry about 57 k in

1100
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:23,340
individual structures so so the

1101
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,170
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you something you need to</font>

1102
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">be something you need to be aware of in</font>

1103
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:29,010
this is that your control servers of

1104
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,940
your of your sensors need to be need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1105
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to deal with the fact that</font>

1106
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,360
sensors are constantly coming and going

1107
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,580
sensors tend to be small and they tend

1108
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,710
to be cheap and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they tend to break they</font>

1109
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">tend to be extremely low power and they</font>

1110
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,470
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and they will come and they will</font>

1111
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:45,030
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to deal with</font>

1112
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:46,589
that and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll burn out the and if</font>

1113
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,390
you're being concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1114
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,580
you have to recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there will be</font>

1115
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:52,319
sensors that will become compromised or

1116
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,990
and so therefore you or will become

1117
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,510
flaky or dangerous in it will become

1118
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,799
a problematic in some way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

1119
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,680
to have a way to cut them off from the

1120
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">network so you're the equivalent of a</font>

1121
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,859
remote trigger black hole effectively

1122
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you need to figure out how to cut</font>

1123
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,040
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut them off at the closest point</font>

1124
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,860
so they can't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else to you</font>

1125
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:16,259
and generally have a knack knack system

1126
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:18,840
in place the about why these would be

1127
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:22,100
used while you use multicast to monitor

1128
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,060
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they your threat model</font>

1129
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,118

because that gets pretty unpleasant so

00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:26,779
so the the types of the types of attacks

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see general so your denial of</font>

in in different places and can be and

mitigate copper theft officer then we

1229
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,880
can mitigate copper theft by using

1230
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,759
wireless backhaul or using some non

1231
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,340
copper backhaul but that gets kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1232
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,730
expensive non<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you use non wireline</font>

1233
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:53,360
backhaul then you get more gaming so

1234
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:56,420
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> secret</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are they using non internet</font>

1235
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:59,060
back backhaul can mitigate some of the

00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,010
some of the some of the capacity to some

1237

of the capacity flooding attacks that

1238
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:06,320
could come from the internet the the

1239
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:09,259
data compromise can be mitigated via

1240
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,670
encryption but you can also give

1241
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,580
yourself a self to not let service when

1242
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:16,640
you do that and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that's</font>

1243
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:19,940
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place the and this</font>

1244
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,100
is the trouble with your malicious data

1245
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,080
injection is actually capturing and is

1246
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,480
capturing it and knowing when it's when

1247
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,770
it begins because once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you capture it</font>

1248
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,830
that's when you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut it off</font>

1249
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:33,230
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the moment you see it if</font>

1250
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,060
you once you've let it get in to get in

1251
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,450
and you say oh we had a malicious data

how long is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been able to corrupt</font>

1256
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:52,550
from the other sensors so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you do</font>

1257
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,649
the sorry the way you do encryption you

1258
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:57,650
can either do it you can either encrypt

1259
00:51:54,650 --> 00:52:00,730
from the 80 back and then across your

1260
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:04,820
network or you can encrypt end in and

1261
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:06,350
end and it's cleaner but but it also

1262
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your multicast scale it gets</font>

1263
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:10,759
harder because because you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1264
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to try to unless your</font>

1265
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,800
encryption is at the application layer

1266
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:20,810
because then

1267
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:23,640
taking taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> non IP data and then</font>

1303

hard and generally that involves that

involve catching the attackers on on

attacking for instance of power grid

of stuff is absolutely coming and it's

with Alvey but now i'm at Google Fiber I

1355
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:43,710
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1365
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:29,910
in the ITF it's also been going on for

1366
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:32,430
quite a while now so let's just get

1367
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:35,279
started I'm not going to really do a

1368
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:38,190
deep dive into rpi there's too much to

1369
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:43,050
cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> really but the basic idea is to</font>

1370
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:45,960
use public<font color="#E5E5E5"> key cryptography with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x509</font>

1371
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:49,950
search which have extensions to cover IP

1372
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:54,540
addresses and a s numbers both before be

1373
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:55,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">six addresses and so these are specific</font>

1374
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:59,070
extensions that have been documented in

1375
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:04,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">RFC 377 I think or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that</font>

1376
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:06,089
and and then those are in turn used to

1377
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,609
sign where to call drought origin

1378
00:58:06,089 --> 00:58:09,400
authorizations it this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one use</font>

1379
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:10,750
of the

1380
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,930
resource certificates that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

1381
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:17,470
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things but right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now a lot of</font>

1382
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">work has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been put into the these rows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1383
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:23,250
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're just they're signed</font>

1384
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:26,560
statements I guess they're called CMS

1385
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:30,040
signed blobs so you take one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

1386
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:33,730
certificates and then you have a CMS

1387
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:36,130
flap that has origin and IP address

1388
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,710
range and you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple</font>

1389
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:40,480
ranges within one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these rows so you</font>

1390
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:44,260
can have multiple of e<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 blocks or v6</font>

1391
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:47,350
blocks and there's 1a s number and you

1392
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:50,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple roles for a</font>

1393
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:52,089
black so if you want to originate a

1394
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:55,210
block from more than one a su would

1395
00:58:52,090 --> 00:59:00,670
actually create multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> roles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

1396
00:58:55,210 --> 00:59:03,760
prefix so again I mentioned this it's a

1397
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:06,790
it it also contains<font color="#CCCCCC"> an expiration date</font>

1398
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,430
and you can also specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> a maximum</font>

1399
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:11,830
prefix length so if you have a prefix

1400
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:13,390
and you want to if you have a / 16 and

1401
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:16,900
you want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow anything up to</font>

1402
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:20,770
like a / 18 you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say max length of 18</font>

1403
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:22,510
and it's a more compact way of doing

1404
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:24,460
that than having a separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1405
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:27,850
each prefix so obviously that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would get</font>

1406
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:29,980
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand quickly if you have a / 16</font>

1407
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:32,710
and you want to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to a / 24 it's</font>

1408
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:38,200
a lot more efficient to do this and they

1409
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:40,840
have 256 different rows so these rows

1410
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,549
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're being published in the same</font>

1411
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:48,190
repositories as the resource

1412
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:50,170
certificates and and so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it our</font>

1413
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:54,160
sink is the current mechanism being used

1414
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:57,910
to to download these from as a

1415
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:00,190
distribution protocol so right now

1416
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:02,500
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our IRS are</font>

1417
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:05,130
operating repositories that contain

1418
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,930
these certificates in these rows and

1419
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:10,030
once you download them you follow

1420
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:12,879
certificate chain to actually validate

1421
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:16,090
the rows so when you download them you

1422
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,590
have to verify them and you know do the

1423
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:19,450
crypto to make sure that they're

1424
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:21,720
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid so that you can trust</font>

1425
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,720
them

1426
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:28,310
as far as I'm integration work with IRS

1427
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">there has been some work done in the ITF</font>

1428
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:35,570
under the site or working group and

1429
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:37,370
there's a graft<font color="#CCCCCC"> rps l dash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sig and</font>

1430
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:40,990
that's been around for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> four years</font>

1431
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:44,089
i believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it went to last call</font>

1432
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:46,370
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> May but it didn't actually</font>

1433
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:51,380
forgot progress beyond the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call and</font>

1434
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:54,940
is sandy Murphy I'm not quite sure if

1435
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:57,310
anybody knows why what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so so</font>

1436
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:00,860
so the idea is add a signature to

1437
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:03,950
existing our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl objects using these</font>

1438
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:05,810
resource certificates and it's actually

1439
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of generalized so you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1440
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:11,840
with several different object types

1441
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:15,920
route route<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> num guess block I net</font>

1442
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">na man inet6 no objects so here's here's</font>

1443
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:21,410
an example of this signature attribute

1444
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:23,720
and you can see it contains a number of

1445
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:27,200
fields here the first field is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

1446
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:31,399
number version equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 the sea is the</font>

1447
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:33,560
certificate URL reference so this we

1448
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:37,850
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the full URL listed here but</font>

1449
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:42,020
so it's our sink URL as i mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> m is</font>

1450
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:46,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the signature algorithm t is a unix</font>

1451
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:49,820

1452
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> object are being signed so you have</font>

1453
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:54,650
to actually have to specify which fields

1454
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:57,140
are the signatures covering and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> b</font>

1455
01:01:54,650 --> 01:02:06,800
is the actual signature itself and coded

1456
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:08,569
in base 64 so so this has some issues if

1457
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,700
you want to use the signature with

1458
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:14,360
existing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> our tools you have to do all</font>

1459
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:16,399
this thing that your validation and you

1460
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,440
know that that that can be

1461
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">time-consuming to have to update your</font>

1462
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:24,300
tools to do that it's

1463
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:26,040
not real trivial work to do that it also

1464
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:29,430
creates additional work for users if

1465
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:30,869
they're already doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> raw as if they</font>

1466
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:32,580
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain both rows and these</font>

1467
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:34,500
signatures they have to there's you know

1468
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:37,830
few separate steps involved so you have

1469
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,869
to remember to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do both of them so it's</font>

1470
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:42,020
just you know users don't like to do

1471
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:45,450
things twice i don't i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1472
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:47,430
another issue that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up recently</font>

1473
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:50,270
as many of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS are using what are</font>

1474
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:52,740
known as a hosted model for their

01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:54,660
certificate authority so rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1476
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:58,379
delegating certificates to users the

1477
01:02:54,660 --> 01:03:00,060
rars are actually hosting certificates

1478
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,390
for users and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the users don't actually</font>

1479
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:07,080
have a certificate that can sign other

1480
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:10,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rbs.l</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> objects with so right now the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">IRS are concentrating on the rows and in</font>

1483
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:18,330
signatures you have to the RSO will have

1484
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:20,100
to support this because the users don't

1485
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,450
actually have this if they don't hold

1486
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:28,200
the certificates actually help being

1487
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:31,439
held by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Robert so our idea is to</font>

1488
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,819
to look at the marks something

1489
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,880
specifically involving the roles

1490
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:38,250
themselves the roles are very similar to

1491
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,619
the existing route in route six objects

1492
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:42,240
in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> psl and so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is to</font>

1493
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:44,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually use the rose to validate</font>

1494
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,919
existing route in route six objects and

1495
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:49,140
so it's instead of using the

1496
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:53,310
certificates themselves we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down a</font>

1497
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:55,529
level and user<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolla's instead and it's</font>

1498
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">not quite as generalized we don't it's</font>

1499
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">only going to cover the route and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

1500
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,380
six objects we're not dealing with the

1501
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:03,380
autonomic I projects

1502
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:12,680
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right now there's an individual</font>

1503
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:14,000
draft on this row<font color="#E5E5E5"> a status attribute is</font>

1504
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,529
what we're calling it right now so this

1505
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,320
is there's a concept of generated

1506
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:20,900
attributes in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> psl we're instead of a</font>

1507
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:23,180
user supplying the attribute the server

1508
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually generates an attribute and</font>

1509
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:28,790
returns it with the object so Rose can

1510
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:30,710
have one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three possible states when</font>

1511
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:34,100
you're doing validations so it can

1512
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">either return a valid response invalid</font>

1513
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:39,290

01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:44,270
match what's in the route object that

1516
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:46,850
would be in an invalid route advocate

1517
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:51,800
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally unknown if there's no</font>

1522
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:07,640
it's kind of a freshness indicator and

1523
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:10,970
then a URI link to our sink you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1524
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:14,810
linked to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the row itself if it's a</font>

1525
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:17,959
valid or invalid status and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font>

1526
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:20,090
the max length from the Aurora I

1527
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:22,010
mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have a max length</font>

1528
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:25,490
field and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually provides some</font>

1529
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:29,390
additional value add to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl and I'll</font>

1530
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">show you example here so in this case</font>

1531
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:35,390
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the royal status and like the</font>

1532
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:38,090
signature attribute there's value pairs

1533
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:40,310
so there's a version field so s is a

1534
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:42,920
stout the status field which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

1535
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:45,680
can be valid invalid or unknown so in

1536
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:48,260
this case there's a valid covering<font color="#E5E5E5"> row</font>

1537
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:53,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">off for this route object for 198 108 00</font>

1538
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:56,000
double sigh 14 the EM field is the max

1539
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:59,930
length field so in this case the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolla</font>

1540
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:03,580
actually has the max length specified of

1541
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:06,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">16 so it means that you can announce</font>

1542
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:12,440
anything under that this / 14 up to a /

1543
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:14,420
16 would be considered valid and and we

1544
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,670
get a lot of questions from people who

1545
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:18,970
want to actually specify a max length in

1546
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:21,610
the rod object in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl when it was</font>

1547
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:23,560
specified in providing a mechanism for

01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:26,200
actually doing that so by adding this

1549
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:28,540
extra attribute where you can by using

1550
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:31,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Royal you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually add a max</font>

1551
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:34,450
length to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing Road object</font>

1552
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:36,970
right now we see people off and we'll

1553
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:39,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> register every possible more</font>

1554
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:43,569
specific route object credit so you get

1555
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:45,670
a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know dupla you know</font>

1556
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:47,140
pollution in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS from people</font>

1557
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,600
registering all these more specifics

1558
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:51,040
because while they may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be announcing</font>

1559
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,230
them all they might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce</font>

1560
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:56,980
them for traffic engineering or you know

1561
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:57,940
to respond to a prefix hijack or

1562
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,460
something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they just</font>

1563
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:04,750
register every you know possible more

1564
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:08,530
specific and then finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> since this is</font>

1565
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:10,720
valid the you field specifies the URI

1566
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:12,880
for the arcing for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> row so if you</font>

1567
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,160
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the validation you</font>

1568
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:18,340
can fetch the row itself and perform a

1569
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:22,060
validation as you can see they're kind

1570
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:24,370
of lengthy so in the in the internet

1571
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:27,340
draft they made that kind of optional

1572
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:29,410
field so our ideas you could maybe have

1573
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:31,180
a flag you specify to who is query if

1574
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:33,819
you actually want that field since it's

1575
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:35,470
so long you may want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you're</font>

1576
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,390
probably only interested in in the

1577
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:39,850
status field whether it's valid or

1578
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:41,710
invalid so you may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care about</font>

1579
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,560
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI if you're not going to</font>

1580
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:47,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do the validation yourself</font>

1581
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,759
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no real point in looking at that</font>

1582
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:56,440
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some issues with with this</font>

1583
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:58,540
attribute you have to trust the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS X</font>

1584
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,190
since it's doing the validation for you

1585
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,890
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing the validation yourself</font>

1586
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:06,760
so somebody acts into the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> our server</font>

1587
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:10,540
and messes with the objects<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1588
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:12,730
there can be an issue there<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1589
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:16,420
concerned about that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do</font>

1590
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:19,470
your own validation on arola there's

1591
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:22,180
another issue with the Aaron repository

1592
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:24,490
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a license agreement</font>

1593
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,930
to in order to get their trust anchor to

1594
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:28,420
do validation

1595
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:30,220
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide sign this relying</font>

1596
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:33,580
party agreement which says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1597
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:37,480
won't redistribute validated royal

1598
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:39,460
information and I've spoken to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

1599
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:43,000
about this and they have indicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1600
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:46,870
would likely violate that agreement so

1601
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,390
their concern is<font color="#E5E5E5"> liability since we're</font>

1602
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:52,120
publishing this the status information

1603
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:55,000
publicly they're concerned that somebody

1604
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:57,000
again may hack into the server and do

1605
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,740
something bad or corrupt the data so

1606
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:05,350
that's an issue we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Aaron</font>

1607
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:06,729
about right now so right now we're

1608
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:09,040
looking at modifying some of the

1609
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:15,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are tools such as I our tool</font>

1610
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:18,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">sets to use this information so another</font>

1611
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:22,090
alternative which would not violate the

1612
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,470
Aaron agreement would be to use to

1613
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:26,230
modify the tools to actually look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1614
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:28,080
local row of cash so in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1615
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:30,729
would have to actually create you own

1616
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,920
validated your own validated world local

1617
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:35,469
royal cash and you would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> signing an</font>

1618
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,000
agreement with Aaron directly to get

1619
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:44,470
their trust anchor and do your own

1620
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:48,010
validation is it any feedback i'll start

1621
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:52,990
off Larry since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so close so 22</font>

1622
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:55,810
comments or questions first it won't be

1623
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:59,380
specific maybe perhaps the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font>

1625

itself i wonder if you see similarities

1626
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:09,280
or are you encouraged by the DNS SEC

1627
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:12,070
deployment with the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is going</font>

on in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sider group and the BGP sex</font>

1630
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,720
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan Kaminsky to get people to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Rob poisoning or the things that will we</font>

1636
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:32,280
lose something that we may wish not to

1637

lose because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1638
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:37,889
I think there's been quite a few

1639
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:41,200
concerns expressed on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list</font>

1640
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:43,739
specifically about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1641
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:47,170
respond to attacks quickly and do

1642
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:48,879
traffic engineering and since they're

1643
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:52,330
our propagation delays with these rows

1644
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:55,090
and you typically only refresh them like

1645
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:58,390
once a day or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you want</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something quickly you know I've</font>

1647
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:06,040
heard feedback on that issue there is

1648
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:08,380
work actually with using DNS SEC to do

1649
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:13,239
something similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rolla with</font>

1650
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:17,440
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inner part button ip6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> darpa to</font>

1651
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:20,559
create these objects in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS that are</font>

1652
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,299
similar to a row as but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

the reverse screens<font color="#E5E5E5"> did and the ideas</font>

1654
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:27,910
it's somewhat simpler and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SEC</font>

1655
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:30,580
stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty pretty widely deployed</font>

1656
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:33,250
at this point so some people feel that

1657
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:39,850
that's a better approach simpler

1658
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:41,620
approach than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rose rpki I'll do an</font>

the problems or challenges with rpki and

1665
01:11:54,730 --> 01:12:00,820
bgp sec is that you need to have the

1666
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:03,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">entire set of rows right in order to</font>

1667
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:05,019
determine this and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in most</font>

1668
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:07,900
rirs every eight hours not every 24

1669
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:10,420

<font color="#E5E5E5">constantly you need to return the or you</font>

that helps for generating your filters

generating your bgp filters from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an irr</font>

1693
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,880
time so i think by me later I mean I see

1694
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,820
this sort of maybe as a transition

1695
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,530
mechanism since there are people who are

1696
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,540
using tools right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are tools right</font>

1698
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:28,140
while for them to deploy new router code

1699
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:29,580
to support the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rows in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the router you</font>

1702
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:38,070
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great idea I think that to</font>

1703
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,560
ease transition right it's easy for

1704

1708
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,230
start using the data once it's published

1709
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,849
it becomes a lot more complicated so

1710
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:57,089
anything that uses that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is a</font>

1758
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,410
last nanog and a lot of those slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1759
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:09,660
totally agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will say that we</font>

1760
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:13,019
did try blocking any for a while and we

1761
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:14,910
had negative repercussions that some for

1762
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:16,410
some reason there are certain parts of

1763
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:18,660
they were certain companies that were

1764
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:20,790
calling us and saying hey because of

1765
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,110
something that we do with any we are now

1766
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:24,120
not trusting you and so we had to

1767
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:25,830
re-enable it and so what we ended up

1768
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,870
doing is we put a filter in place that

1769
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:29,940
just watches it because as far as we're

1770
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:32,550
concerned any is shouldn't be happening

1771
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:35,040
very much or at all so we just basically

1772
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:36,930
did an RL equivalent with our own

1773
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,269
scripting and just shut it off after a

1774
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:42,090
couple of tries so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had you were</font>

1775
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:43,320
paying attention there but yeah no word

1776
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:44,850
out we're definitely keeping an eye on

1777
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,410
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I wish I had a better answer</font>

1778
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,810
but I also agree with the sentiment that

1779
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:51,059
if we if we block it they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

1780
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:54,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the next thing so you know</font>

1781
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:56,160
