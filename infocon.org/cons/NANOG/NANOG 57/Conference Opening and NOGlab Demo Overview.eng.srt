just don't submit things for review and

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">then they either submit them at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

22
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:39,280
after them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a testament to</font>

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,500
the quality of the content that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we still</font>

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:47,890
got that many submissions and we're able

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:52,479
to fill with with more content than we

26
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:56,500
had more content than we could accept so

27
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,509
just a few reminders there's a break

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,380
area where some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you had lunch outside</font>

29
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:04,179
earlier that is where the brakes will be

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:10,840
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the meeting for coffee</font>

31
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:14,590
and such the survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted to</font>

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">call that out as we always do one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

33
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,200
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure we say is</font>

34
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,970
that if you really like something please

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,500
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that also don't just</font>

complain we're happy to hear your

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,700
complaints and everyone in the room is

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,390
certainly as good as I am at complaining

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,519
when necessary but if if you guys could

40
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,260
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us when you really like something</font>

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that helps us figure out how to improve</font>

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,760
the program going forward instead of

43
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,739
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming that everything is neutral</font>

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,858
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are just trudging through</font>

45
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,859
it

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,220
efficient and oh he's very helpful the

49
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,130
other thing we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out is</font>

afternoon break there is an errand

53
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,489
public policy consultation and this is a

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,580
track we're going to include going

55
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,810
forward here at nana as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron and nanog</font>

from the operator community you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,220
relevant to them in many different ways

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,930
everyone in this room one way or another

60
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,600
has influence on Aaron whether you're a

61
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,390
voter whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember well you know</font>

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,130
whatever that may be this is a way to be

63
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,410
heard by Aaron and there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be people</font>

64
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,200
in that track who may not normally be at

65
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:42,340
nanog who represent Aaron<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we hope</font>

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who feel strongly about their</font>

67
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,890
relationship with Aaron will attend

68
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,450
wanted to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> out real quick the monday</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wednesday program i know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,019
out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting will likely make</font>

73
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,150
some changes based on feedback and that

74
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,150
goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the surveys just to find</font>

75
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,950
efficiencies for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you who are</font>

asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about YP rooms on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wednesday</font>

77
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,510
afternoon there's a good reason for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

78
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,640
that allows peering related content to

79
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,480
follow that we've regularly had an issue

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,940
with for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the GPF meetings</font>

81
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,370
colliding with<font color="#E5E5E5"> nana sponsored socials</font>

82
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:28,270
and in order to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happening</font>

83
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:31,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">going forward we thought best to to put</font>

84
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,479
that by itself to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GPF the</font>

85
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:39,160
people who run gpf to have their own

86
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,950
time after nanog we will attempt to

87
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,919
publish the skeleton for the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

88
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,599
early as we possibly hem we will

89
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,909
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it a little bit late after</font>

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,160
this meeting just as we we debrief and

91
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,390
regroup and figure out what did work and

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,510
what didn't work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this monday</font>

93
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,159
wednesday program but once we've done

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,200
that

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,460
will will certainly update the schedule

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,219
discussion guidelines they're posted on

97
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,960
all of the microphones basically speak

98

buildings that actually connect to our

424

428
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:11,809

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also additional cloud providers and</font>

that's 10 gig to each of those access

434
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:28,370

talks a little bit about the additional

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,570
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned it's a 100 megabit</font>

only thern a transport that ethernet

458
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,080
transport is a subset<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we call</font>

466
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,460
amazon and a couple of our providers out

467
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,690
there and then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,120
application of where where you can

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,710
actually get allocations of bandwidth by

00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,360
thank you that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time I have for</font>

473
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">today like I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ta telecom is proud</font>

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,110
your access on for today we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

476
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,760
an opportunity in the future to one day

477
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,159
talk about additional stuff and do some

478
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,140
some network on Brownback sessions and

479
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,620
breakout sessions and tutorials thank

480
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your time</font>

481
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,960
thank you so real quick we wanted to

482
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,929
give you guys a glimpse<font color="#E5E5E5"> into what we're</font>

483
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,310
doing over in the nog lab as I mentioned

484
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:40,330
there's been some significant changes

485
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:43,690
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at using it in what we</font>

486
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:46,210
think it can provide as far as insight

487
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,550
into the future network so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

488
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">invite at ballast from Indiana</font>

489
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,899
University who's more or less leading up

490
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,200
the effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there to give us a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

491
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">through what's going on sure sure yeah</font>

492
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,730
so I work in the global knock and I have

493
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,410
the pleasure of managing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> team that</font>

494
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,300
develops network monitoring and

495
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,150
management and in general network

496
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:13,600
control software and so what I want to

497
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:21,100
do today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is oh I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up I did the</font>

498
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:22,240
reflexive click that's right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

499
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,129
so what I want to do today real quick is

500
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,770
just talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about sort of how he came to</font>

501
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:30,520
have some open<font color="#CCCCCC"> flows software that we're</font>

502
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:32,230
demonstrating here today so going back

503
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,060
in time basically way it works is the

504
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,340
global knock collaborates with an

505
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,080
organization called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet to who</font>

506
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,060
whose mission is to service the research

507
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,689
education networking community with a

508
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:45,639
nationwide backbone so in collaboration

509
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,850
we built out a hundred gig nation wide

510
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,740
open flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and my team has</font>

511
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,230
developed software that runs on that

512
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providing customer controlled or</font>

513
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:58,390
customer provisioned vlans we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

514
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">have other applications in the future</font>

515
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,890
but thus far today the main application

516
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,500
is this is this sort of portal based

517
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,480
provisioning system so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you to</font>

518
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:14,410
come to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nog lab and check it out we</font>

519
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:16,340
have a multi-vendor demo of that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

520
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:21,630
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

521
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">do I point this thing it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

522
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,860
there we go brief history so this might

523
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,600
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit more than in brief if I</font>

524
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,790
can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the seam to go faster alright</font>

525
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,070
so in the beginning quote unquote in

526
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:35,100
late two thousand nine the<font color="#CCCCCC"> openflow 10</font>

527
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">spec was was published the key concept</font>

528
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,459
here that was an enabling technology was

529
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,320
his a notion of separating the data

530
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,610
plane from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane really what</font>

531
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,600
this gave us as developers was a

532
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:49,020
vendor-neutral programmatic access later

533
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,240
in july of 2010<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was awarded 60</font>

534
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,710
62 million dollar grant from the

535
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,310
government to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build out a hundred gig</font>

536
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:58,710
capable network and so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

537
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,330
embarked on in deploying a brand new

538
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,800
optical system as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

539
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">capable layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two layer three system</font>

540
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,780
fast-forward to April 2011 people's

541
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,890
minds got going and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they realize</font>

542
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,180
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to something here the</font>

543
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">combination of those two those two</font>

544
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,830
precursors so what they what we create

545
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,900
was this thing called ndd I the network

546
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,939
design development initiative whose

547
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,310
objective was to develop a

548
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,720
software-defined wide area network our

549
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:27,450
objectives were to support

550
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,340
simultaneously domain science<font color="#E5E5E5"> so people</font>

551
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,510
doing physics research etc etc as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

552
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,000
as those doing fundamental network

553
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,440
research in some ways those things seem

554
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,730
diametrically opposed some people want

555
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,530
the network to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> stable others want to</font>

556
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,730
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to break it but the</font>

557
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,960
upshot is really want to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a</font>

558
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,520
way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> just doing a better job with</font>

559
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,480
network engineering and how to design

560
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,860
these things so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> month later we decided</font>

561
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,240
based on all the risks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really</font>

562
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,949
wanted to pick an established use case

563
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,270
which this customer controlled<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans was</font>

564
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,800
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had already had in place for</font>

565
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,590
several years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really put our</font>

566
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,970
focus in the down stack risks the

567
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,490
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself the requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

568
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:01,740
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source we had we provide a</font>

569
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,420
VLAN translation<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup past sub-second</font>

570
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,430
provisioning and failover integrated

571
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,750
measurement management as well as high

572
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,450
availability we bake that into the

573
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,890
software design we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were</font>

574
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,690
going to roll out a 10 gig network as a

575
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,790
baby step what you see in the lab is

576
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,190
essentially that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network just in sort of</font>

577
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,659
in localized form and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we</font>

578
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,040
embarked on evaluating the switches and

579
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,370
controllers to figure out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good bad</font>

580
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:26,730
and vapor in September time frame we

581
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:29,340
decided upon the NEC 5820 as a switch

582
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Knox controller and we decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

583
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,409
we're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

584
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,700
going to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bake in the h</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a and the</font>

585
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">application layer not rely on the</font>

586
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,270
controller stack looks like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

587
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">running throughout time so if you want</font>

588
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,360
more details<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this come talk to me</font>

589
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,340
application looks like this point and

590
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">click geographic frame of reference easy</font>

591
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and users can use it in their</font>

592
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,840
bathroom right or whatever this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

593
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:51,930
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like five nodes</font>

594
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,360
geographically distributed so a month

595
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,860
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working demo from there</font>

596
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,689
we went and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at a package called</font>

597
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jenkins which provides a sort of</font>

598
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,410
continuous integration automation that

599
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,760
kind of thing we also use mini net to

600
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,410
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do testing before we</font>

601
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,060
actually had<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware in hand we had one</font>

602
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:09,180
switch the time and we faked it with

603
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,010
many net from there by December that

604
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,330
year we had five nodes deployed

605
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,850
geographically and the network is

606
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:18,960
operational 24 by 7 monitoring we did a

607
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:22,290
void mission critical application

608
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,910
procedures so from there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> took us by</font>

609
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:26,580
another 10 months<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

610
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,200
deployed that was a brocade system and

611
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,480
then this month<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're actually looking</font>

612
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">at throwing junipers into the mix later</font>

613
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,790
this month and also something called

614
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,350
flow visor so we could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

615
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:38,250
multi-tenancy which I can go into when

616
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:39,149
I'm there so in the lab itself we've got

617
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,080
two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks that are</font>

618
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,510
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing they're</font>

619
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,550
multi-vendor we're using OSS<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

620
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,500
contribute configure them so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

621
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come by and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play with them and you</font>

622
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically just check out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's all</font>

623
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,560
about so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be there today</font>

624
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow from 10 to noon and four to</font>

625
