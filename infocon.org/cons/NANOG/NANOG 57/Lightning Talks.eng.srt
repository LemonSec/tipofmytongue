weird for me know the next slide how

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,020
you've actually got that oh I got

slightly that bull the green arrow a

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,630
people started attacking DNS servers

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,460
with any queries and there was a talk or

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,829
a panel session at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous nanog</font>

meeting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dallas that talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

widespread every operator has been

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,040
seeing this since then we've seen those

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,039
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beta bit but we've seen a</font>

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,219
proliferation of more any based queries

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,020
and this is any queries coming over UDP

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,129
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP to be a little more specific</font>

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,500
about this we see the tackler no service

21
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,420
not as us as the victim but us as the

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,180
unwitting participant in passing traffic

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,820
downward to the victim which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

thing the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attacks or that</font>

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,020
we have to have mitigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS it's a</font>

everybody involved the mitigations

briefly that you can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

29
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,439
adding capacity to make bigger servers

30
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,820
if we really intended victim we have to

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,919
add more bandwidth and more service and

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,330
all that but since we're just reflecting

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,070
these attacks down to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real victim</font>

34
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,929
we're actually adding more fuel to the

fire for that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so adding more</font>

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,150
capacity really isn't the the real

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,700
answer we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into response rate</font>

38
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,740
limiting is a now<font color="#E5E5E5"> much talked about</font>

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,570
response to this mitigation to this that

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,439
was brought up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network session</font>

43
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,500
were looking at but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's very</font>

44
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,490
compelling solution and it's a response

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,810
rate limiting that's bringing

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,399
significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been calling to</font>

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,990
limiting response is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the important part</font>

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,809
of how this works and it's important to

keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind and the wording i have</font>

strongly actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change that</font>

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,250
wording up it's not that this has a

answer any question you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it's your</font>

63
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,950
prerogative we have kind of observed

00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:33,828
that the any cruise themselves have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

limited positive use but a huge negative

use these days is growing and we'd like

<font color="#E5E5E5">to just say okay we're not going to</font>

information any query over UDP TCP is

70
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:46,040
fine it's fine to giving away<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

71
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:48,200
information but because of the nature

attacks if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just cut out the UDP part</font>

we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to we'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that's</font>

what we can do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> story line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that in</font>

I answering for answering any queries

77
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:01,670
over UDP and we listened to the

<font color="#E5E5E5">complaints</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it whenever you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">make a change you get complaints the we</font>

80
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,250
got a couple of reasons why it was a bad

81
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:12,109
thing for some people and la<font color="#CCCCCC"> people told</font>

82
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,959
us how we should be doing things instead

83
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,940
of the way that we were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,790
response to that we're still refusing to

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,829
this day we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking at response rate</font>

86
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,929
limiting is a interim solution in arc we

87
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,609
called interim because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd like to go</font>

88
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,500
back to where we are today eventually

89
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,760
just say let's not do this but we

90
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,549
realized that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

91
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,239
have a larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion before we get</font>

92
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:37,190
there what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> discovered in the time</font>

93
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,599
that we've turned off these queries and

94
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,970
just refusing them we found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

95
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:44,929
there were two basic earnest reasons for

96
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,980
using these queries over UDP we many

97
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,379
people know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one their</font>

98
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,590

00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:52,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably if we see that and</font>

100
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,220
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other ways to get the</font>

101
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,870
information the first one the domain

102
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,730
name registry some of them actually do

103
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,489
pre delegation checks if you go to some

104
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">tlds and say I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want a name they'll often</font>

105
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,780
say are your name servers running

106
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,250
correctly and this is not not every

107
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,290
registry out there does the same thing

108
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,780
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> one customer of ours said they</font>

109
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,519
had four problems I contact<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

110
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,089
first to this and we no longer require

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,590
that check<font color="#CCCCCC"> over any any over UDP the</font>

112
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,200
third would really want it so we want to

113
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about that also the suggested fixes</font>

114
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,960
we got they were varied which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

115
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,849
gave Evan

116
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,680
that there really isn't a quick fix to

117
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,280
this anywhere in this in the protocol I

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,340
think everyone agrees to that so why did

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,318
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother do a lightning talk on this we</font>

120
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,299
want to start a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

121
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,650
a final report that we're doing this but

122
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,349
we want to go out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and raise</font>

123
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,960
awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this kind of query that</font>

124
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:47,120
we're seeing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> as fallen to become a</font>

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,940
tool of the evil not a tool of a good

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,560
anymore and you don't really need a need

127
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,509
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it as a protocol engineer you</font>

128
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,370
say that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good part of the</font>

129
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,530
protocol is very nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and elegant it's</font>

130
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,880
it fits on the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everything was</font>

131
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,919
an operator where you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,750
different goals and objectives and

133
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,948
running a network this is this is

134
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,539
something which has<font color="#CCCCCC"> just become abused</font>

135
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,060
it's like putting a faster car on the

136
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:10,460
street for someone to steal so we really

137
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,800
have shifted this from a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

138
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,719
it's a burden to us so we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to say</font>

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,970
can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not you can nobody use it</font>

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,800
because we find out that there really

141
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">are only corner cases using this and</font>

142
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,139
there are alternatives out there so

143
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what we're trying to promote here</font>

144
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:30,710
now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of critiques on this</font>

145
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,859
approach we're picking on<font color="#CCCCCC"> UDP UD be</font>

146
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,090
pasted UD be based any even knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

147
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,740
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other alternatives for the bad</font>

148
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,780
guys to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come and do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing but</font>

149
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're using this this is what we're</font>

150
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,500
seeing right now and it's one thing that

151
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,789
we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knock this off when it</font>

152
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,020
comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many other alternatives we</font>

153
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:48,020
can do the same thing there there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

154
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,810
lot of things available that can be can

155
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,789
amplify the response and in many cases

156
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,770
most of those queries are queries that

157
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,740
no normal person would ever actually

158
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,460
issue to a dns server and we can go out

159
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,870
that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> after one so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to</font>

160
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,289
operated community talking about this

161
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,520
way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think and of course the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

162
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:09,560
why is the start of a conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">know there's a lot of discussion to be</font>

164
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,530
had about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a good idea or</font>

165
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,639
not and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to come now</font>

166
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,799
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll leave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some time for questions</font>

167
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,199
at this so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna stop talking now</font>

168
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,699
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and someone said they were</font>

169
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,400
gonna bug me<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point but he's</font>

170
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:26,389
still sitting down so nope he's moving

171
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:31,840
he's walking he guaranteed me he bugged

172
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:31,840
me about something jean-christophe

173
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">how about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now in Le real um I wasn't</font>

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually gonna come up but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since you've</font>

175
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:51,029
forced my hand so I think it's obviously

176
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,580
obvious to you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not the other</font>

177
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:57,389
people this is a very short-lived

178
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,800
solution for a more general problem but

179
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,279
something else perhaps I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

180
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,819
wondering about for a while is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

181
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:09,689
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't for dns and perhaps ntp i</font>

182
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,610
wonder would we be allowing any UDP

183
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:14,309
across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet these days because</font>

184
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,199
it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two protocols</font>

185
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:18,419
seem to be the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

186
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,639
keeping significant number of networks

187
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:26,430
from filtering you to be completely off

188
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,439
of existence as a departure in part

189
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,680
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this problem but but possibly</font>

190
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,909
others as well but for spoofing in and

191
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,189
you know uncontrolled flows and that's

192
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:37,800
worth it yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agree with that i think</font>

193
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,509
the d indeed out the first game d das is

194
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,059
because we allow this fire-and-forget

195
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:44,490
across the ISPs then would be nice to

196
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:49,439
stop that if we could figure out a way

197
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,580
to do that hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> dave temkin netflix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

198
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,409
don't think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in a position</font>

199
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,779
where we could block<font color="#E5E5E5"> UDP on the internet</font>

200
00:07:54,409 --> 00:08:01,620
but there's certainly plenty of

201
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:03,779
legitimate uses but this is not

202
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,939
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique problem if you look</font>

203
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:11,360
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was bit tag issued like a</font>

best practices document regarding

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,199
specifically SNMP to residential

206
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,789
networks due to a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

207
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,519
because people were using the fact that

numerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPEs are configured to allow</font>

you know with public is the community

210
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send one packet and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">caused a flood back is this something</font>

212
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,279
more so where it needs to be more

213
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,010
targeted like that instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

214
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,549
suggesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know we we need to</font>

215
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,740
block it all together it's it's hard to

216
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,718
yeah we tried giving these like<font color="#E5E5E5"> white</font>

217
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">listing and letting who some people</font>

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,470
issue these queries the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns just doesn't</font>

219
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,810
relent itself to that kind of

220
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,050
localization it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little harder to</font>

221
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,250
constrain this but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are what their</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like i said it one time i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

stop port 53 from transiting networks

have it come<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight to us right of it</font>

226
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,610
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are ways of to go this it's it's a</font>

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work in there in the next night</font>

228
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,070
we have to figure out what's the best

229
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,240
way to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I think particle</font>

230
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,070
engineering I used to be there a lot and

231
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was here's what we go after but</font>

232
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,089
operations we have a whole different set

233
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,019
of what we're after that's that's what's

234
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,389
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

235
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,769
realize that really good fast cars

aren't the best thing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a congested</font>

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:03,750
I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring this up to discuss the</font>

245

idea of layer 0 automation and what it

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:10,260
means and i'm sure all if you can look

247

<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that picture that picture on the left</font>

picture in the middle is your data site

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:19,529
and we hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future</font>

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:24,870
everybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data side will look like</font>

the ones on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right the problem</font>

253
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:34,319
opportunity that we think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that every</font>

254
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,240
layer of the OSI stack is pretty much

255
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:39,300
software-defined today except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> layer</font>

256
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,620
0 and I checked I don't think when when

257
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,170
I checked on Wikipedia and there is

258
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really no clear definition of later 0</font>

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:50,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway but most people understand layer</font>

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">12 layer 7 and the layer 0 is below</font>

261
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:56,360
obviously layer 1 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fiber</font>

manifestation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the data center</font>

264
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,769
is the fiber optic patch panel and today

265
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,729
that is part of that network that is

266
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:13,290
still manually configured

267
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:15,890
and needless to say you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

268
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:19,050
know more about the shortcomings of that

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:23,730
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network then I can ever</font>

270
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:25,979
explain because I've not been a data

271
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,720
center operator myself so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

272
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,280
of secondhand<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge as far as I'm</font>

273
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,490
concerned but most research mode study

274
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:38,310
say that fifty to eighty percent of

275
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:44,610
network outages are usually caused by

276
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:47,219
some form of<font color="#E5E5E5"> human error and and so what</font>

277
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,680
this has transpired into the last 20

278
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,570
years of managing large networks these

279
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:58,650
people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> become very conservative and</font>

280
00:11:51,570 --> 00:12:00,750
they have this unspoken unwritten best

practice of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ain't broke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't touch</font>

282
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:07,980
it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how most networks are</font>

283
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,720
operated and in the process what happens

284
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,550
is that people over provision networks

285
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,860
just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't want to touch it</font>

286
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:18,630
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there is probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

287
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:23,010
opportunity to actually automate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

288
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:24,600
layer and bring it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the toolkit</font>

289
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,880
of the network operator so the network

290
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,430
operator can actually manage even that

291
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,410
layer just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like he manages or he or she</font>

292
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:35,640
manages all the other layer layer

293
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:37,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network stacks and since the you know</font>

294
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,010
the three words have to be spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

295
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,850
time these<font color="#E5E5E5"> days which is Sdn which is</font>

296
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:50,250
about you know bringing the network to

297
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">essentially respond to the layer 7 and</font>

298
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,850
above so how do you how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

299
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,730
layer move how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make the network</font>

300
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,000
one dynamic we like to propose that

301
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,150
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll layer 0 can be looked upon</font>

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,120
as one more tool in the toolkit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SDN</font>

303
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:10,340
so that you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimize the</font>

304
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:15,380
the the nature of the network the

305
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:19,670
resources of the network without getting

306
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,670
without taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk of actually</font>

307
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,840
essentially causing some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

308
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,930
error which could be much more costly

309
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,160
than the benefits<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might fail so one</font>

310
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,569
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to do is</font>

311
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">to kind of bring in the community or</font>

312
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">here to see if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a way to raise</font>

313
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
the level of confidence in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way in</font>

314
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,270
the way layer 0 is managed and therefore

315
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,550
can you actually optimize it rather than

316
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:46,319
over-provisioning it as we have been

317
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing in the past few years oh so</font>

318
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,290
obviously this is not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem that</font>

319
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,870
has not been known for a while and a lot

320
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,849
of effort a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of activity has</font>

321
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,700
transpired in the last few years and and

322
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,890
some of the founders of this company at

323
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cal Tech</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve it with</font>

324
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,170
very sophisticated technology like MEMS

325
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,650
and photonic switching and things like

326
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:13,140
that unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you can tell you</font>

327
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,180
know the cost of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things have to</font>

328
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">compete with the manual patch panel or</font>

329
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,209
at least be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ballpark you know</font>

330
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,130
uses of layer 1 switching to actually

331
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,340
accomplish the same thing can be very

332
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,130
very expensive the cost is one issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

333
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,600
second one big issue is scalability you

334
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,820
know it's it's kind of easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

335
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">two hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ports switch or maybe even</font>

336
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,430
an 800 port switch but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go into</font>

337
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,260
a meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> room and you have 60,000 ports</font>

338
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,469
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see when will be the mem</font>

339
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:50,040
switch available at 60,000 ports and at

340
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:53,570
what cost and it what size so this team

341
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,870
so we've come up with kind of a

342
00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:00,270
relatively elegant very simple hardware

343
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:04,410
but very sophisticated software solution

344
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:09,720
to solve this problem and so it is

345
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:12,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a switch which is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

346
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,690
your manual patch panel so essentially

347
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,520
the one in the middle the red thing that

348
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:21,060
you see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that diagram it just sits</font>

349
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,970
right next to your your top of the rack

350
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,579
switch and all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers below it and</font>

351
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,550
this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration has</font>

352
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,720
thousand and eight duplex porch and you

353
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,890
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the website and all</font>

354
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,180
that and you can study about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the product</font>

355
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,090
but the idea is

356
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,459
it uses off the shaft thoughts you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

357
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:41,310
everything that we build comes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

358
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">in China today so use the same equipment</font>

359
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:48,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> T connectivity or 3m or Huawei or</font>

360
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,849
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will buy from the</font>

361
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,460
same suppliers and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together this man</font>

362
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:58,130
you patch panel the difference we have

363
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,130
is we have a off-the-shelf

364
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:07,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick-and-place robotic arm along</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

365
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,990
the with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch along with thing</font>

366
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,730
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know the on the picture</font>

367
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,140
on the right lower picture on the right

368
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,540
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arm which has a</font>

369
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,870
robotic arm and that robotic arm

370
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,089
actually does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration based on</font>

371
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:25,170
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide to the computer that</font>

372
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:27,990
you want to change for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 72 port 32 and it</font>

373
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,640
does this the invention<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is so these</font>

374
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,160
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people have tried these</font>

375
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,610
things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past the difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

376
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,569
is that the algorithm that drives the

377
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:42,240
robot is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the breakthrough that the folks</font>

378
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:45,870
at Caltech came up with which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is based</font>

379
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,600
on the theory of knots and braids now

380
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,640
i'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> some people already googling</font>

381
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,400
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nuts and braids and you can see</font>

382
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,080
it's a 700 or your mathematical theory

383
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,510
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is usually used in string theory</font>

384
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,730
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> closest application of this</font>

385
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,550
thing is in genetic engineering where

386
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:05,339
they actually essentially define the

387
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:10,260
helixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNA helixes of how they</font>

388
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:12,510
would operate so that's the thing what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

389
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,310
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the conversation your</font>

390
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,869
words to actually see how something like

391
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">this which is very cost effective and</font>

392
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,669
can scale just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a manual patch panel</font>

393
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:23,460
can be used in the data center and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

394
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:26,730
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to make sure i have go to a</font>

395
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:29,160
couple of apps and then open it up for

396
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,950
questions so that people can look at it

397
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,970
one of the big apps that we've been

398
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:38,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">working with with some beta sites in the</font>

399
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,340
u.s. today or what they call smart hands

400
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,830
in this case as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the</font>

401
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,770
automated patch panel could actually be

402
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:51,149
shared between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> collocation cages</font>

403
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:55,080
around it and today<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could actually</font>

404
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,360
make a change so let's assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that XYZ</font>

405
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,710
company has a Colo location in one

406
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,479
wilshire boulevard at the course site

407
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:05,220
data center the XYZ company might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

408
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,330
Mountain View and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

409
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,460
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their colocation physical</font>

410
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,290
infrastructure today they actually hire

411
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,140
smart hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the smart hand takes</font>

412
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,330
about 24 to 48 hours and has the risk of

413
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,310
making a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mistake and all that and they</font>

414
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:24,330
make the change but in this case they

415
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:28,440
could actually just tunnel into into a

416
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:30,570
GUI and make the trade online and the

417
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,470
changes would happen in minutes maybe

418
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:38,310
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 120 seconds at the most from</font>

419
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:40,260
one port to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other and because the</font>

420
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,720
computer does it the record keeping is

421
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,900
computerized<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inventories comes right</font>

422
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,240
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if the change has to be relooked</font>

423
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">no three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months from now everything will</font>

424
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,750
be there you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry about</font>

425
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,370
records and all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I know and</font>

426
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,850
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of things that you</font>

427
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of one application</font>

428
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,120
the other application is where you could

429
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,399
actually have something like an open

430
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,919
flow interface down to the switch and

431
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,810
the switch can decide and switch can

432
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,430
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to requirements of it whether</font>

433
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,080
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from one type of</font>

434
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,420
application were you using certain

435
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,250
resources in the physical architecture

436
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:18,890
and you want to switch to the other

437
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:21,900
architecture you know there are

438
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:24,000
applications such as these so I we have

439
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,860
kind of listed a few applications you

440
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,050
can download the app download the

441
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:33,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation and we would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

442
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:37,050
some feedback from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user community</font>

443
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:40,920
and finally I'd like to leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> you with</font>

444
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:45,510
something to smile about so you could do

445
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:48,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and that's my email and I love to</font>

446
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,280
hear from any of you during the meeting

447
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,930
or after the meeting go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin and</font>

448
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,280
there is a demo actually on our website

449
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,440
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you send me an email i can send</font>

450
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,889
you a link and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually see the</font>

451
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,980
cal tech demo of how this product works

452
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,980
thank you

453
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,300
great thank you very much I think we

454
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:18,960
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for a question or two if</font>

455
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:22,780
anybody has any Brian Dixon verisign a

456
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:27,060
couple of quick questions one is does

457
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:31,690
the device label the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cables physically</font>

458
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:35,560
did they actually the each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the cables</font>

459
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,930
and and the port are numbered so the

460
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,970
numbering actually is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way we label</font>

461
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,830
it but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other ways you could do</font>

462
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,510
it but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment it does not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

463
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you're thinking about but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

464
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,510
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually every</font>

465
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,580
time it actually makes the configuration

466
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,650
it does clean the label it started

467
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,659
killing the fiber and so the fiber

468
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:56,110
cleaning is actually taken away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

469
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:59,800
human interface and is it able to

470
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,870
replace a defective cable is that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

471
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,260
the functions that can do I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> rich</font>

472
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,389
cable if is it able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace a</font>

473
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,129
dysfunctioning cable yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah you</font>

474
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,660
could have spare cables in the system

475
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually replace it if</font>

476
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now one of the biggest</font>

477
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:16,900
application which I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a chance</font>

478
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,669
to show you was a one of the big things

479
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happens a lot is transceiver</font>

480
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">failure and this could actually solve</font>

481
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,770
the transceiver<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure without a truck</font>

482
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">roll or without sending anybody out</font>

483
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:33,070
there if you didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a redundant how</font>

484
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:35,760
hot standby which are not cheap okay

485
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,760
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>

486
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:48,780
okay and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scott white from</font>

487
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:54,730
google our last lightning talk thanks

488
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:57,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so thanks to thank you thanks to</font>

489
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,970
Josh snow horn and his roller coasters

490
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:03,429
and his buckets of rum I have 10 minutes

491
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,910
to talk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my brain is not functioning</font>

492
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:08,200
so I'm going to speak very slowly and

493
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:13,660
hopefully will remain coherent the whole

494
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:18,370
time so project cardigan an SDN

495
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,380
controlled exchange fabric so networking

496
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:23,678
has many<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to many people in this</font>

497
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:26,559
room but essentially I claim now

498
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,960
networking is boring why is networking

499
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,580
boring well it's in a bit of a rut in a

500
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,650
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

501
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons maybe but I mean we started with</font>

502
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,910
pen Meggie<font color="#CCCCCC"> thermit and 100 big ethernet</font>

503
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,480
and one gig Ethernet and 10 gig Ethernet

504
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,580
now 100 gig you did it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know with</font>

505
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ram we've managed to lose when I started</font>

506
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">we had even less than 50,000 routes but</font>

507
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,400
we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything would break it a</font>

508
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,080
hundred thousand outs now we're cramming

509
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,570
almost half a million rossiter<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am and</font>

510
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:59,049
will double that shortly soon I'm to uh

511
00:22:52,570 --> 00:23:01,330
I'm sure so you know what if what if we

512
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,470
stopped and thought about what what if

513
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,720
what if we tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

514
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,760
differently what might it look like you

515
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,470
know might not change anything might

516
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:14,260
change something in some small way and

517
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,840
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that leads us to the sexy</font>

518
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,129
software-defined networking software

519
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,110
defined networking is another one of

520
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,549
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know is all</font>

521
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,570
singing all dancing at this point means

522
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:27,610
everything to everyone but some people

523
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,730
got together in New Zealand basically

524
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,709
and thought well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if what if we</font>

525
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,260
thought of software-defined networking

526
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,690
as being you know an enabler for

527
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,480
networking very similar to what open

528
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:44,440
source operating systems right if if it

529
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,110
allows the user of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

530
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,380
actually reach down in and have more

531
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,300
control over it and what in that context

532
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,950
that earlier question of what what

533
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:58,659
might you do differently with networking

534
00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:01,090
becomes slightly more concrete so the

535
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,820
folks who I'm speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> over or mostly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

536
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:07,780
New Zealand there's a nice p down there

537
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">citylink who raised a point that you</font>

538
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,139
know they felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like interexchange</font>

539
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,450
internet exchanges would be you know a

540
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,390
good potential starting point for for

541
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:18,700
some exploration here and then they were

542
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,600
there are a group of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people down there</font>

543
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,130
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community and in the</font>

544
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,050
operational community who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested</font>

545
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:34,270
in stn and they needed something to

546
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:36,970
focus on so basically well like I said

547
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,560
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain is not functioning so I don't</font>

548
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,960
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go over what an internet</font>

549
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,280
exchanges in here too much but I think

550
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,900
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to point out what an</font>

551
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,610
internet exchange is not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

552
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,950
router it's not a switch it's not any

553
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular type of enabling technology</font>

554
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:53,110
in the end and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in exchange is where you</font>

555
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,030
advertise things you want sent to you

556
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">and where you push packets that you want</font>

557
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get back end up so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font>

558
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:05,230
generic turn you know description of

559
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:06,780
what any IX is so so we came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

560
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,750
this project cardigan which is an

561
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:13,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunate name with some subtle New</font>

562
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:17,290
Zealand humor which I won't try to

563
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:23,500
explain here something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with their</font>

564
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:29,139
sheep and wool ah but but but basically

565
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:33,760
um so phase one for this project

566
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:37,480
cardigan was to get an SDN device onto

567
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:41,320
the i-x in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wellington and so this was</font>

568
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,990
completed back in December basically we

569
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:48,340
took the picture there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of</font>

570
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:51,580
this PK 8 30 to 90 which is a switch

571
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:54,850
that actually supports<font color="#CCCCCC"> OVS on the top</font>

572
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:58,389
and that was convenient because these

573
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,260
fellows in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazil CPD have this project</font>

574
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,810
they've been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for a while</font>

575
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:05,140
called open flow sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob flow and what</font>

576
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:06,100
Rob flow does is it takes essentially it

577
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,169
takes

578
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">OpenFlow on the bottom and quagga on the</font>

579
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:13,330
top and it loses it together with some

580
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,189
with some virtual machines and it

581
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:18,789
enabled it in its peak cell vs on the

582
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:22,450
bottom so we were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take out ovs</font>

583
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:25,330
and put in this this hardware that

584
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,090
actually speaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 vs up the top and it</font>

585
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,860
all just worked and so essentially what

586
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,850
we've got now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> without a device on the</font>

587
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">i-x that will accept the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BTB packet</font>

588
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:39,100
through the switch make its way through

589
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:42,070
the VMS up to the quagga instance the

590
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">quagga instance will process the the BGP</font>

591
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:46,928
update changed the Linux routing table

592
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:49,840
in the vm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's another</font>

593
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:51,610
process that will you know watchdog<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

594
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,000
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and push them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back down into the</font>

595
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">harbor so voila we've got you know an</font>

596
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,330
SDN control plane that's controlling

597
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,159
local hardware and you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

598
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:08,949
operational forum so there we are we

599
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:11,169
have a route but you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

600
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,900
that's not really exciting right we have

601
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:18,070
a route it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty boring so the</font>

602
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">next phase was fairly obvious probably</font>

603
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,809
two to make it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> full route server so in</font>

604
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,428
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time as we got it up we</font>

605
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,770
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> then just added a bunch of</font>

606
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:28,840
routes so that everybody on the

607
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wellington a new exchange computer</font>

608
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,699
across it so again still pretty boring

609
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,140
progress<font color="#CCCCCC"> was still pretty boring a</font>

610
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,679
couple weeks after that after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

611
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,299
hacking to actually extend some of the

612
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,299
functionality that existed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

613
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:49,809
flow something interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen we</font>

614
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:53,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually brought up a second switch that</font>

615
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:54,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">was in a remote location in a different</font>

616
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,980
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the city that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually being</font>

617
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,980
controlled by the same open flow

618
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,409
controller so now we've got an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

619
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,059
distributed router running in an

620
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:07,870
internet exchange as a route server and

621
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:09,789
it's actually passing production

622
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:12,189
customer traffic in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

623
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">rihan's which is a research network in</font>

624
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,690
New Zealand<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they were good enough to</font>

625
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually hook their office up to it and</font>

626
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">are running real traffic across it so</font>

627
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:24,089
it says they're big thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 ends and</font>

628
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dylan hall for taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that step so uh</font>

629
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:29,639
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know now that we've got this</font>

630
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:33,039
interesting I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

631
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:36,248
capability what's the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the</font>

632
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,719
next step well there's a couple a couple

633
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:39,700
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we need to do I mean I</font>

634
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:41,200
showed one route<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not too</font>

635
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,269
interesting we've got the control plane

636
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,589
proof of concept now we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

637
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:46,509
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the data playing we need to</font>

638
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:49,149
stress<font color="#E5E5E5"> test today to plane and show that</font>

639
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:52,149
we can actually get you know routes in

640
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:54,218
and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the data plane sorry i should</font>

641
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,658
say prefixes or entries in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

642
00:28:54,219 --> 00:29:00,849
the data plane in a you know in a

643
00:28:55,659 --> 00:29:02,229
reasonable time frame in scale there's

644
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:05,468
also some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do a layer</font>

645
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:10,419
to you know to experimental things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

646
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:11,919
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the most direct directly</font>

647
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:14,589
interesting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we're going to</font>

648
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,950
work on next is actually getting the

649
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:20,549
fabric to enforce policy so I mean we

650
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,169
have this sdn we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this capability of</font>

651
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:24,789
programming the fabric to do to only

652
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:26,259
have rich to build we want to do exactly

653
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:27,639
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need well let's run with that</font>

654
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:30,549
let's actually make the fabric and

655
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:32,769
forces security and prevent customers

656
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,690
you know participants from being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

657
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:37,149
hurt each other and see how that

658
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,649
simplifies operations it increases

659
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:42,609
reliability so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

660
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:46,958
<font color="#E5E5E5">next big step for us so in the end</font>

661
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:50,019
hopefully network is almost not quite so

662
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:52,119
boring as it was and here's a list of

663
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:53,999
folks in losing that have been hard at

664
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:58,619
work on this so thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

665
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:58,619
now any any questions about any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

666
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:11,530
cool okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much just one</font>

667
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,000
housekeeping item this is your<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

668
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,440
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visit the nog lab if you</font>

669
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,250
haven't already that's happening from

670
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,050
1030 up until noon in Atlantis a and

671
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,180
right now we have a break sponsored by

672
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Netflix and we will see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in here</font>
