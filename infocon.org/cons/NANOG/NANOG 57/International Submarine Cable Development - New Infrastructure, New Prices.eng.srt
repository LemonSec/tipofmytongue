standing in front of seaworld yesterday

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,849
and did not get in there was a little

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,380

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,489
in this session here with Tim strong

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:56,520
from telegraphy talking about submarine

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:58,108
cables welcome good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> my name is</font>

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,800
Tim strong i'm with the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> research</font>

18
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,140
firm tell a geography and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">take about 30 minutes and present some</font>

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,670
of the data we've been gathering for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,000
last for several years on the submarine

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,950
cable sector and see how they the

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,600
developments in this transport layer

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,490
sector have affected IP prices and

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,380
transport prices everyone knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,750
the big bandwidth boom and bust that

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,280
happened a little over a decade ago but

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,810
since then there have been a lot of

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,240
developments in the submarine cable

30
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,700
world and there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of activity</font>

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,699
even now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward that's going to</font>

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,530
change things as new capacities come

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,549
online prices have shifted and we're

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'd like</font>

35
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> divide the the presentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up into</font>

36
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,048
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite-sized chunks first of all I</font>

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,610
want to talk about recent cable

38
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">investments so just take a brief moment</font>

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,579
to look backwards that's what has

40
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,689
happened in the summary cable world

41
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,398
secondly I want to talk about planned

42
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,048
builds to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on in</font>

43
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,530
the future and how that might affect

44
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,229
your businesses thirdly I want to talk

45
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some of the reasons there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

46
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,350
construct cables demand lack of supply

47
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,440
potentially prices like competition

48
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,680
in certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> markets fourthly is a bit of</font>

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,780
an aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk about how users</font>

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,930
of this transport layer capacity have

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,430
configured their circuits specifically

52
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,820
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three so in other words the</font>

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,380
geography of international connectivity

54
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,820
and finally I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap up by talking</font>

55
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what's going to happen with</font>

56
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,799
capacity prices where we currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand</font>

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,119
now how transport prices affect IP

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,310
transit prices and where things<font color="#E5E5E5"> might go</font>

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,160
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's occurred to me is a bit</font>

60
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,490
of an opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that since we nanog is</font>

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,090
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> orlando this year we're in the place</font>

62
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,690
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Walt Disney built so I</font>

63
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,640
thought it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be appropriate to have</font>

64
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,420
a separate sort of theme for the

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:07,049
presentation today now the magical

66
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,179
kingdom of submarine cables I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

67
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,960
stuck this in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I don't want</font>

68
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,790
to put this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as beginning of the</font>

69
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,200
presentation in case any Disney

70
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,200
copyright lawyers around although I

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,910
think we're going under fair use yeah so

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,739
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss different lands</font>

73
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,870
of the the world of the submarine cables

74
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,030
and basically you kind of have two

75
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,920
choices if you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there thinking</font>

76
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,100
I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the transport</font>

77
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,320
I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only care about layer 3 or you</font>

78
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,710
hate Disney for example your hand

79
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,690
despise our our way of life well this is

80
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,370
only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be 30 minutes about 25</font>

81
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,990
minute presentation five-minute Q&A

82
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,000
afterwards if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any questions</font>

83
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,670
you're welcome to go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,410
coffee on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand if you're</font>

85
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,690
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there thinking man I love nanog</font>

86
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,280
but I wish there was someone who would

87
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,950
present some information on summer and

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,110
cables and you kind of find yourself

89
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,609
daydreaming about I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know writing</font>

90
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,850
space mountain with your fellow loggers

91
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,280
then all I can tell you is a picture

92
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,720
MacBook Airs down sit back and fasten

93
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,140
your seatbelts because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Buster you're in</font>

94
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,790
for the ride of your life yeah check

95
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,268
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

96
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,699
yeah that's an advanced Microsoft

97
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,820
Technology right there what can I say

98
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is magic okay let's let's start</font>

99
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,750
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about what's happened in the</font>

100
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,070
cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and as I promise we're</font>

101
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,789
going to be the lands of the magic

102
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,710
kingdom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> submarine cables so occurred</font>

103
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,240
to me that the cable operators are

104
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,570
really pushing out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boundaries or the</font>

105
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,009
frontiers of what's happened in in the

106
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,810
world of connectivity which countries

107
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:44,039
are connected which are not so we're

108
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,710
going to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> this little section yeah</font>

109
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">frontier lad hope you like the belts</font>

110
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,739
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a I've been wanted to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

111
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,139
one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and never had an excuse to</font>

112
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:58,259
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so 1998 a little over a</font>

113
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,120
decade ago here is a map<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

114
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,150
countries in the world that had fiber

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,729
optic connectivity the<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grey</font>

116
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,679
are the ones that shaded in gray the

117
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,770
ones that had either a submarine cable

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,849
connected to it or as landlocked or was

119
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,940
a country<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had access to a submarine</font>

120
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:20,340
cable via a neighboring<font color="#CCCCCC"> country with a</font>

121
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,990
terrestrial fibro access so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

122
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,510
most of the developed markets in the

123
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,030
world already had a connectivity to at

124
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,520
least one cable the one shaded in red

125
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,070
did not there were quite a few countries

126
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">in red that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still do not have access to</font>

127
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,770
a single cable much of Africa for

128
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:42,389
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like that parts of South</font>

129
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">America in fact in 1996 i believe the</font>

130
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,349
population of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world in countries</font>

131
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,340
that did not have access to cable is

132
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:52,560
about 4.8 billion that's no less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

133
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,539

134
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,289
the world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have access to a</font>

135
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,940
cable and in fact i just recently

136
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,940
learned that probably should have shaded

137
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">somalia cambodia and even north korea in</font>

138
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,669
gray<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they have Overland access</font>

139
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:11,280
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 countries that do have fiber</font>

140
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,948
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> not surprisingly apparently the</font>

141
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:19,710
North Korean connection isn't heavily

142
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:23,520
used but the frontier has expanded lots

143
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,109
of connectivity here's a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

144
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,500
countries that I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find and I</font>

145
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,530
could

146
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,300
be wrong on some of these that do not

147
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,349
yet have submarine cable connectivity

148
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:37,200
the list is growing to Africa but look

149
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,080
at the actual usage just one country in

150
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,280
Latin America Brazil have uses three

151

153
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:50,670
it's been an uneven development in the

154
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:55,500
last several years but things are

155

two or three systems planned and even

the Arctic has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of there are</font>

187
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:22,800
so this actually shows the ones that we

188
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,289
tell our geography think are currently

189
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,880
funded that's of as of today it could

190
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,140
change tomorrow there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some cables</font>

191
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,750
that apparently are fairly close to

192
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,460
getting their funding so the number is

193
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,599
really dwindled when we look at it this

194
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:39,530
way from eight to three in the Pacific

195
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:45,660
from nine to four in Latin America

196
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:48,480
so where is the development happening we

197
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,430
think that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are currently 12 cable</font>

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,220
systems that have reached funding or

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,680
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in terms of funding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

201
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,620
in Latin America or one region is a

202
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,290
Latin America another is southeast asia

204
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,699
guessing that not too many of you are

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:13,370
terribly interested in this South

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct any more remarks to that</font>

209
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,700

215
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,060
focused on that region there's also a

knowledge none has reached full funding

222
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,750
status yet Australia a lot of new cables

223
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,700
planned for that area we'll see what

happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> even across the Pacific where</font>

225
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,410
there's fairly recently been some builds

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:06,390
a lot of rumors now about new cables

227
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:11,339
going in there so we'll see but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

228
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:14,520
focus in on a Latin America there are

00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">several cables that are that are planned</font>

and many of which are funded and they

generally start from the top this is

293
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,800
this is sax a south atlantic cable

system it's essentially run by a

295
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,380
consortium of Angolan carriers just kind

296

of interesting Angola to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazil this is</font>

299
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,069
couple reasons one it would enable South

300
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,050
Africa to us capacity which I'm guessing

301
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,870
if they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the right the</font>

303
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,340
just as fast from South America<font color="#E5E5E5"> on South</font>

Africa to Miami is it isn't right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

305
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,830
from London to South Africa but also

306
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:36,839
they really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get their capacity</font>

307
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:38,520
to Florida or to New York so they may be

308
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,520
encouraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build their own system</font>

309
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:45,810
that to connect this South Atlantic

310
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,870
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's a glimpse at</font>

311
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,550
what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

312
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,870
cables let's look at for a few minutes

313
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,719
that some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are given</font>

314
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,700
to build these systems there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

315
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good reasons and you occasionally</font>

316
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,080
here in the market some very bad reasons

317
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,510
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know why it really gets</font>

318
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,250
on my nerves is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to build a cable</font>

319
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,020
this place this country because they're

320
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,810
hosting the Olympics or the world cup I

321
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,819
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the 90 terabits of unused</font>

322
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,489
unlicked acids not going to be enough to

323
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,830
handle the Olympics so there are some

324
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,810
myths in the industry so we're going to

325
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:23,370
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> this land of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the magic kingdom of</font>

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,540
cable bills is capacity exhaustion up

332
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">until just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few years ago the amount of</font>

333
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:46,410
potential capacity that was not lit was

334
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,060
beginning to dwindle demand was because

335
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,189
of growing demand people were lighting

336
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,500
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> wavelengths the amount of unlit</font>

337
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,900
wavelengths in these cables was going

338
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,769
down so eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to run</font>

339
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,300
out of capacity

340
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:02,129
build new systems right not really

341
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">something strange has happened it's not</font>

342
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:06,089
that demand has gone down demand

343
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:08,189
continues to be strong but the

344
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:10,410
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upgrade technology and</font>

345
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:12,689
submarine cables has really changed in

346
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,759
the last few years cable operators are

347
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:17,009
able to squeeze far more wavelengths at

348
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,199
far greater bit rates than I thought

349
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:21,209
possible just a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago so now we</font>

350
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the potential capacity for the</font>

351
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:26,518
existing systems is far higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

352
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:29,879
previously thought so yeah demand is

353
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,189
still growing strong this is just Latin

354
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:35,309
America you can see the red line is

355
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:38,399
annual growth the percent of annual

356
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:40,170
growth each year in terms of used

357
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,860
international bandwidth and by that I

358
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:47,779
we're defining<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as the amount of</font>

359
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:50,369
capacity actively used in network so we

360
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:53,850
tell geography go out and survey people

361
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:55,739
like you in under NDA get information on

362
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,209
how much capacity running our layer 3 or

363
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:59,069
other types of networks then add them

364
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:01,229
all up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's growing very rapidly</font>

365
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:02,878
about fifty three percent last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

366
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,309
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit higher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font>

367
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,689
global average a very strong demand in

368
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:08,689
Latin America so that's a good reason

369
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:17,009
but why is this happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> user growth</font>

370
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:18,660
in in South America is very strong the

371
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,639
red line is the number of broadband

372
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,670
subscribers just just fixed by the way

373
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,829
mobile is even higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> than this fixed</font>

374
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,079
broadband subscribers has<font color="#CCCCCC"> group going up</font>

375
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:29,638
and at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the speed of their</font>

376
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,239
individual connections has gone up as

377
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,730
well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users are pushing this who's</font>

378
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,799
connecting these subscribers well

379
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,480
unfortunately all that really cool

380
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,459
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt that we're able to</font>

381
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,970
collect we can't really break down at

382
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:47,459
the individual carrier level to publish

383
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:51,119
because it's under NDA so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I've</font>

384
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:54,738
done is to some basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp analysis</font>

385
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:59,910
adding it all up by carrier so worldwide

386
00:16:54,739 --> 00:17:04,049
the number the upstream ISPs with one

387
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:09,000
hop asn adjacency or access to just

388
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:09,510
broadband ISPs if you add it all up the

389
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,550
number of

390
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,280
subscribers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those ISPs level three</font>

391
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then telia are one and two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

anything like that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pure asn</font>

395
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,199
reach but it's kind of interesting if

396
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:29,639
you look at Latin America the people who

397
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,410
are the biggest in the world overall

398

aren't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest in that</font>

which is an idli small market<font color="#E5E5E5"> Verizon</font>

the next slide at the transport layer

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have many choices of different</font>

cables but essentially that there are

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,439
three big boys one is level three which

414
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,170
also sold a fiber pair on their

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,790
secondly<font color="#CCCCCC"> telefonica so so we're seeing</font>

423
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,010
limited competition and as we'll see

424
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,879
later on in the at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the</font>

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:41,310
presentation prices have not fallen

nearly as fast down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> latin america as</font>

00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:48,060
they have in some certain other parts of

430
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,330
deployed in their networks let's look at

where they've deployed them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

words the geography of international

475
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,580
a pretty big range that we've observed

476
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,879
so this is right in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle the</font>

477
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:14,129
median of our observations put Miami on

478
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:16,980
here very low I think the median price

479
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:20,158
for Giggy was a dollar some dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty</font>

or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that for you can find</font>

potentially even lower in mcminn Miami

483
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:30,649
Mexico City there's been a lot of

484
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:33,779
competition that price competition there

485
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:35,820
but you move to South America in Central

486
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,600
America and you see that prices are far

487
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,760
higher

488
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,760
like to focus especially on saw Paula

489
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,530
which is of interest to a lot of ISPs

490
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,320
and content providers because of Brazil

491
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,030
is such a big market very expensive to

492
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,340
access the internet from a provider in

493
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,930
Sao Paulo it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be generally</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Paulo twenty to thirty dollars it's a</font>

498
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:04,050
tremendous difference so that's one

499
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,240
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs choose to</font>

500
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,899
instead by transport up to the US and

501
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,930
get their uh their transit there but if

502
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,580
you're an American content provider or

503
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:18,000
European content provider an ISP and you

504
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,980
want to get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in in Sao</font>

505
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,900
Paulo it's also a problem for you

506
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,270
because if you're if you want to buy

507
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,190
locally in those markets and you're not

508
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:30,090
able to peer for whatever reason it can

509
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:32,160
be an expensive proposition so not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

510
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,840
our price<font color="#CCCCCC"> is lower in the United States</font>

511
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in Asia in other parts of the world</font>

513

that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little counterintuitive</font>

515
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,220
normally what we see is when there's a

caveat out there and finally the last

563
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:48,270
slide or two I have here compares IP

564

transit prices versus transport prices

565
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:53,879
and this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on monthly price</font>

566
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,559
per meg kind of like you price a port IP

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't think of transport prices in that</font>

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,780
you see that has come<font color="#E5E5E5"> down it has come</font>

580
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:32,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">down quite a bit however the price is</font>

581
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:35,520
still very high and if you're exempt for

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:40,020
example a nice p in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazil and you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">green line so that's mine the IP t plus</font>

587
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,928
transport but what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to buy</font>

588
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:54,480
local IP transit in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sao Paulo if</font>

589
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,909
you're a nice be down there or if you're

590
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,260
a u.s. ISP and you want to move down to

591
00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:03,030
there that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red line so you can see</font>

592
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still quite a big gap</font>

593
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,760
between

594
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,250
mean the option of going to my I mean

595
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,710
buying transport or getting local<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipt</font>

596
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,070
and saw Paula various reasons for this

597
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,650
but one clear thing that's it suggests

598
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,289
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me is that the cost of transport</font>

599
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,750
between Brazil and Latin America to the

600
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:23,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. still plays a very important role</font>

601
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,120
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to see what happens we</font>

602
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,270
know that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot of</font>

them if they're funded may have very

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:34,530
aggressive pricing schemes that it's a

606
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:37,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">little early to say but history suggests</font>

607
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,299
from our submarine cable industry that

608
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,220
when lots of cables are built especially

609
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:44,639
if some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have wholesale models</font>

610
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,260
prices do tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall and some of them</font>

611
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,169
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these prices can fall fairly</font>

612
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,408
rapidly so we'll see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

613
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:54,690
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conclusion of my presentation</font>

614
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:57,799
and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up for any</font>

620
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,309
you guys ever consider putting a sea

monster<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the corner or anything</font>

this it's a Victorian style and we

625
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,010
thought about sea monsters maybe next

626
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,720
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but i have a few samples if</font>

627

anyone sitting let's take a look alright

628
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,960
so my real question is with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> america</font>

cable you've got a company that's a

632

cash-rich they can pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cable</font>

633
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,590
for sure they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a captive audience</font>

634
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:50,059
of subsidiaries and every one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that they know they're</font>

a that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> no-brainer seems like the</font>

640
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,050
subsidiaries now are we using their own

641
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,809
cable to do international traffic so I

642
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:08,210
they're going to pull demand I would

643
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:11,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine out of whatever are the current</font>

644
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:15,050
cables and will though be enough growth

645
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:18,139
in demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> to absorb the loss if if those</font>

646
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:20,919
guys were to move to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> am one cable</font>

647
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:24,679
and then still still increasing

648
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:26,870
additional cables on top of perhaps a

649
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,520
loss in the overall demand I suspect

650
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,620
there will be sufficient demand I don't

651
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,910
know if it can support two or three new

652
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,239
wholesale cables but it can definitely

653
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:37,550
support at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least one not only is demand</font>

654
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:43,670
growing rapidly but there's probably pin

655
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:46,490
up demand Brazil numbers just showed

656
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,130
briefly the end user growth the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is</font>

657
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,170
sort of saturated at sixty-seven percent

broadband subscriber at her home

659
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:55,340
Brazil's at thirty percent and still

660
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,050
growing so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pent up</font>

661
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,360
demand and prices are still high enough

662
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,649
so even if they really tanked at least

663
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,820
for a few years you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

664
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:04,429
good pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good return on your</font>

665
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,169
investment so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's still a</font>

666
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:08,990
pretty strong business case for some

667
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:13,790
wholesale builds down even with that am

668
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:16,040
one coming online okay thanks matt

do you what do you thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

671
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:22,830
I mean at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day most of us</font>

672
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">want some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of diversity and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

673
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:29,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">one cable comes along is that enough to</font>

674
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:31,200
break the stranglehold I mean our sort

675
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:33,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">of experience in Australia shows that</font>

676
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,730
sometimes it does because people

677
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:37,289
rebalance but ultimately to get

678
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,960
diversity still need to buy on the

679
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:43,259
original cables now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can keep prices</font>

680
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,490
high so if we only build one cable down

681
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,519
there is that going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to</font>

682
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:51,059
drive down the prices a lot or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

683
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,529
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the others will play ball yeah I'm</font>

684
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,299
not sure just building am one's going to

685
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:56,129
be enough to build to drive down prices

686
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:58,049
but if one of these other systems comes

687
00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:00,809
online yes they're point-to-point

688
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:03,539
systems they're not full rings like the

689
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:06,240
old I won't call them<font color="#CCCCCC"> old timey but the</font>

690
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:09,869
older<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems from a decade ago so</font>

691
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,090
you'll still need diversity but in some

692
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:14,279
respects<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cosy market</font>

693
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,990
right now for these suppliers and if

694
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,519
they start seeing a lot of their

695
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,309
customers going<font color="#E5E5E5"> away they're going to be</font>

696
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">forced to respond and they do have a lot</font>

697
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,509
of spare capacity so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that's not</font>

698
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:28,678
the problem it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue</font>

699
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:30,749
potentially of competition so I suspect

700
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,220
there could still be sufficient

701
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:38,639
diversity even with only one or two more

702

cables<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks hi Steve Powell on level</font>

703
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:43,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">three I had a quick question on the most</font>

704
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:45,149
of the countries I'll say in the East

705
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,190
Side South America generally have very

706
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:49,498
high tariff structures usually in excess

707
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,450
of hundred percent you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know compared to</font>

708
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,950
let's say these countries on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the west</font>

709
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,409
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Andy's which is usually in a</font>

710
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,929
twenty to thirty percent region and my

711
00:30:55,409 --> 00:31:01,649
question is do you see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as having</font>

712
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:04,860
any impact and um let's say preventing

00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:06,899
let's say or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 14</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yo future build outs</font>

714
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,939
because of that high cost not just for

715
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:10,889
submarine cable but for any type of

716
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,509
infrastructure build-out and are you

717
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:14,490
seeing those numbers reflected in the

718
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:16,889
number in terms of what you're seeing

719
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,289
for statistics on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> east side versus</font>

00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:21,029
the west side I don't have a lot of data

721
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:24,360
tariffs in terms of government

722
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:26,129
regulations and fees correct yeah I

723
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,199
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of data on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / countries</font>

724
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:29,939
is more anecdotal but but yes I

725
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,410
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this as a problem and I</font>

726
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,840
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of glossed it over for the</font>

727
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:36,990
of time during my presentation but it is

728
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,090
a potential problem for business plans

729
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,880
of these cables and for the market in

730
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:44,040
general just a few examples in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazil</font>

731
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,640
from what I hear there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100-percent</font>

732
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">tariff on imported networking equipment</font>

733
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,570
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to have a data</font>

734
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,550
center if you want to go down there I

735
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to buy even if you can get</font>

736
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,730
treat cheap transport down to Brazil you

737
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own data center here with</font>

738
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,520
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think it's going to be</font>

739
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">great it still could be very expensive I</font>

740
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,780
also heard now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

741
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,560
still true but Argentina trying to keep

742
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,930
its current account and balance does not

743
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,179
like people bringing in foreign goods

744
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,650
and it can take a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so even if</font>

745
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,300
there's not necessarily a tear up there

746
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:17,850
there could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of red tape for</font>

747
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,050
that so it is potential problem and I

748
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:22,649
don't know if that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get solved</font>

749
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:24,120
any time soon yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just one I you</font>

750
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,470
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of confirms on my suspicions</font>

751
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,419
because you mentioned all those very

752
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,030
very high traffic flows from New York

753
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,760
and Miami and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was my thought maybe</font>

754
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,320
people have made the decision is cheaper

755
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build their data center to support</font>

756
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,899
Latin America in North America instead

757
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,430
for that very reason the latency

758
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,800
concerns that people and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

759
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,450
many customers down there potentially

760
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,399
but but yeah let's say you build in

761
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Santiago like Google is building well</font>

762
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,850
there's no new cables being built down

763
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,780
there so either you're going to have to

764
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,980
hope for a new system or you're going to

765
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,230
buy capacity on one of the existing

766
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,860
systems so it's kind of a trade-off

767
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:05,250
thanks thank you thanks for Jim thanks

768
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,260
very much 11 quick questions and hold on

769
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,270
one second we had one question on the

770
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,830
chat that I want to post out here I

771
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,960
missed the Olympics and World<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cups lied</font>

772
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,340
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity capacity in South America</font>

773
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,930
what are the predictions for the next

774
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:21,120
big event big event big sports events

775
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:25,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming up what are you expecting for</font>

776
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:28,429
South America to happen and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

777
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:31,440
we've seen like the London Olympics

778
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:34,680
specific carriers that handle it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

779
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,780
see a big increase but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

780
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,180
seen globally or even for the country

781
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,889
that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge change so I don't</font>

782
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,590
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a game changer no pun</font>

783
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,539
intended

784
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,029
for the overall capacity industry in

785
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:48,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brazil perfect thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you Tim thank you</font>

786
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:48,630
thanks everyone
