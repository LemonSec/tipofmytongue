and now we'll switch gears into a much

Doug Midori analysts with Renesys and so

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,010
in my job at Renesys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep an eye on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago and nobody knew what ever</font>

17
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,640
happened to it it had never been

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,739
activated the government would never

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak about it and so I set up something</font>

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,530
to clue me in if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ever saw something</font>

21
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:03,449
send me an email we ever saw some some

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,630
evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cables in use and co</font>

23
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,929
weeks ago that email came so taking a

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,539
step back so a little background on this

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,360
for people didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation so</font>

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,240
up until very recently Cuba has been

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,799
entirely reliant on satellite internet

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,589
due to the fact that they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

29
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,509
submarine cable going to their island

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,390
nation that connects them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the global</font>

31
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet so at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about two thousand seven</font>

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,930
the state telecoms of Cuba and Venezuela

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,280
got together and they announced plans

34
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,250
they're going to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cable from</font>

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,829
Caracas over to Cuba and try to solve

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,810
this problem it's the project

37
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,899
experienced a lot of delays but

38
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,540
eventually in February 2011

39
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:48,649
alcatel-lucent completed the the project

40
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:52,200
and but since then in about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years</font>

41
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:54,799
since that occurred there was no

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,030
evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> of any any any improvement in</font>

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet connectivity what there is in</font>

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,310
Cuba and and then it was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,969
explanation from the Cuban government as

46
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,360
far as what ever happened to this cable

47
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:11,700
so that all changed a couple weeks ago

48
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,090
so i actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had set up in market</font>

49
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,589
intelligence is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

50
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,819
one of our products<font color="#E5E5E5"> i set up you let me</font>

51
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if there's any new provider that</font>

52
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,750
shows up for attacks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuba and so i</font>

53
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,349
got an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email one day I went and</font>

54
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,209
investigated it and we looked at this is

55
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:28,629
this graph is kind of a visual<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeline</font>

56
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:32,319
of trace routes and latency measurements

57
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,510
going into Cuba that helps follow the

58
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,790
the sequence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> events here so on</font>

59
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,340
january fourteenth we saw the first

60
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,929
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> both routing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telefonica showed</font>

61
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,560
up as a variety for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a taxi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the</font>

62
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:48,430
state telecom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuba and that in and of</font>

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,410
itself was in the evidence of activity

64
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,420
of the on the cable what was really the

65
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,569
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smoking gun was the fact that we</font>

66
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,280
were seeing Layton sees around 400 300

67
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,018
to 400 milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a</font>

68
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,660
gentleman earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> as making the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

69
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how you can you pick out satellite</font>

70
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,739
Layton sees and they are like on the

71
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,900
order of 480 to 500 milliseconds they

72
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,450
really can't be any shorter or lower

73
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,940
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that due to the laws of physics so</font>

74
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,970
when we saw these these Layton sees that

75
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,130
400 we knew this this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be it</font>

76
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,280
couldn't be satellite in both directions

77
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,709
and so then we think on january

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,579
twentieth we published a blog detailing

79
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:32,620
these what was our discoveries we

80
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,109
theorized that likely the like 400

81
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,459
milliseconds was still quite high if

82
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:39,220
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really using the submarine</font>

83
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:42,310
cable so our speculation was that these

84
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,079
guys at the Edit exa had set up a they

85
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,180
had a default route I probably whatever

86
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,519
was their cheapest satellite provider

87
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,139
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending everything out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l</font>

88
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,209
traffic was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out their cheapest a</font>

89
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,549
satellite provider and then all sudden

90
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,190
you could come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a new way a new path</font>

91
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">via</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telefonica and so there was a</font>

92
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,599
symmetric routing going on and that

93
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">would explain why you had a very high</font>

94
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,540
but not high enough a latency to be

95
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,489
consistent with with satellite so that

96
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,290
was our theory and then was interesting

97
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,209
so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we published this blog we</font>

98
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,370
started get some media attention so we

99
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,820
were getting calls from reporters we did

100
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,060
stories with ap Reuters I did an

101
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,060
interview with NPR and as the story

102
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">started to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then I got a call</font>

103
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,150
on

104
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:32,080
like january twenty third from the

105
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:36,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">Reuters bureau chief in Havana call</font>

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,139
Danny said hey we've got an IT guy in

107
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,729
our office our IT support guy he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

108
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,800
Cuban it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning English but he's</font>

109
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,120
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that something just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

110
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,710
about an hour ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like oh</font>

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,060
really he's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

112
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,948
looks like things<font color="#CCCCCC"> have improved again</font>

113
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,409
and so while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the phone i'm</font>

114
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:52,629
writing in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRC at work like somebody</font>

115
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:54,250
pulled data from Cuba right now and then

116
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:56,169
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to hang up and were</font>

117
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,900
like yep we're seeing we're seeing a

118
00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:01,030
drop across the board as if they changed

119
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,479
their default route instead of going out

120
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,460
a satellite to go out the cable and so

121
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,289
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the satellite providers now drop to</font>

122
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,330
a something with more akin to a

123
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:12,180
asymmetric satellite link whether you'd

124
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,340
come in satellite and go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cable</font>

125
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,389
and anyway so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote another blog</font>

126
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,619
about hey look there's an improvement

127
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,840
looks like they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> may perhaps</font>

128
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,349
resolve this so maybe we were correct in

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,830
our theory and then what was nice was

130
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:29,409
just to put a bow on a nice week was the

131
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,169
human government actually came out and

132
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:34,289
confirmed this story I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd</font>

133
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:39,219
ever hear anything from these guys but

134
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:42,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> following day after we fell</font>

135
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:46,930
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> wood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the second blog the the</font>

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,460
Cuban Communist Party news outlet put

137
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,159
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> an announcement saying yes since</font>

138
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,948
January 10th we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing the the</font>

139
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:55,930
cable and and then they also put it in a

140
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:57,580
cat a little caveat or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> warning saying</font>

141
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,719
hey just because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting this</font>

142
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,568
cable going<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean they're going</font>

143
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:06,789
to increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet in Cuba</font>

144
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:08,909
which is highly constrained and so that

145
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:14,139
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice nice to get that confirmation</font>

146
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:16,090
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll wrap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up my my lightning</font>

147
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,279
talk here with you know internet

148
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,859
measurement can have real impacts this

149
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,569
lady<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yanni sanchez became our best</font>

150
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,879
friend that week she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

151
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,710
tweeting out anything we were saying we

152
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,169
got a lot of response from folks the

153
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,698
Cuban people people in Cuba were sending

154
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,039
us trace routes just to confirm you with

155
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,129
how they what they were seeing for for

156
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,360
traffic

157
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:52,309
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a it was a fun week they</font>

158
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:54,110
may have any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks the next</font>

if the slide decks<font color="#E5E5E5"> look similar is</font>

163
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,580
because I stole<font color="#E5E5E5"> them from Renesys so</font>

164
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,960
thanks Todd Underwood so I'm talking a

165
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,940
little bit about juniper<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP convergence</font>

166
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:27,020
there was a problem some of us have seen

167
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,699
it I've talked to about 30 people at

168
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">nana's over the last several years who</font>

169
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:34,250
have seen this issue basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

170
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,039
would notice is for long periods of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

171
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,080
like like 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> + minutes or more or less</font>

172
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,320
depending on the load there would be a

173
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,320
point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> route installation on any</font>

174
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,570
juniper router would stall you what you

175
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,219
would see is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would see routes go</font>

176
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,469
into the pending state and they would

177
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">just stick there and then eventually</font>

178
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,419
after some some number of minutes

179
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,430
something magic would happen the the

180
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,430
stall would clear everything we just

181
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,900
install quickly we've we've literally

182
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,780
been saying this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many years and</font>

183
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've been working with juniper everyone</font>

184
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,520
from small networks to not small like

185
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">medium-sized networks to very large</font>

networks have<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see</font>

187
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:20,530
this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an issue and they haven't</font>

188
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to reproduce it until now so</font>

189
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:27,280
here's how I managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reproduce this</font>

190
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:30,830
for them what we did we took a MX 480

191
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,838
just modern box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and PC uplinks doing no</font>

192
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,779
traffic it's literally doing nothing but

193
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp top-of-the-line routing engine so</font>

194
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:41,029
the quad core 1.8 giga hertz with 16

195
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,909
gigs of ram that you can you can buy and

196
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:47,750
we set up a normal ibgp mesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

197
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:50,990
which in this case to reduce the load is

198
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:55,130
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big 28</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ibgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions across</font>

199
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,500
four different bgp update groups it was

200
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,970
about 4.8 million paths in total that

201
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">are that are being fed into this box</font>

202
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a pretty standard if you run a</font>

203
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,850
network and you've got ibgp this is what

204
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,410
you'll see and we threw on<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

205
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,330
simulated full tables to try and

206
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,060
replicate the point being this is not

207
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,010
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> close to a real network load this</font>

208
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,910
is just the bare minimum that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

209
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,680
get and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see so this is</font>

210
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,360
kind of hard to read on the screen but

211
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,910
basically what you're looking at the

212
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,269
the number the red line is the total

213
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,949
paths on the box the<font color="#CCCCCC"> green line is the</font>

214
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,959
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of routes in the pending state</font>

215
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,550
and the blue line is the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

216
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,149
routes that are actually installed into

217
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,459
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fib so what happens you see that the</font>

218
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:41,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">Box does not get a full fib table for</font>

219
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:42,829
what is that about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 67 minutes but the</font>

220
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,750
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

221
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:48,260
six minutes it doesn't get any routes at

222
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,959
all and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is why and the next</font>

223
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,950
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how come it clears as soon as</font>

224
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,130
the total paths maxes out so here's what

225
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:02,209
we figured out happened the scheduler

226
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,339
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> our pd gets so busy processing</font>

227
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:05,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp routes that are coming in from all</font>

228
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:08,360
of its<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbors that it can't actually</font>

229
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,769
install the routes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fib which i</font>

230
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is a bad thing because i like my</font>

231
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:15,290
routers to forward packets once you

232
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">finish receiving all the routes and this</font>

233
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,250
graph isn't even accurate enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

234
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,470
it but it's an instantaneous drop it

235
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,180
starts the pending routes go away you

236
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,440
can now devote some cpu time to actually

237
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,269
processing the routes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

238
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,930
received and you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> installing</font>

239
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:32,410
them to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fib so we did a little work</font>

240
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,089
well with juniper and we got them to

241
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,069
test something that we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

242
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,449
correct fix for it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this</font>

243
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,100
does is it tweaks the schedule of

244
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:42,979
priorities a little bit so that instead

245
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,050
of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely blocked by receiving</font>

246
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,459
the routes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also take a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

247
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,829
time to actually do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them</font>

248
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,890
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really improve performance</font>

249
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:54,199
by a ton but it you at least don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit</font>

250
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,269
there with no routes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIB for four</font>

251
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:58,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">five six minutes and remember this is</font>

252
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:59,779
this is a lab scenario in real life and

253
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,699
in anything less than a top-of-the-line

254
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,260
routing engine what you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a real</font>

255
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:05,120
network is 20 plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes you try this</font>

256
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,029
on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> exat 200 it's literally like an</font>

257
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,820
hour and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ridiculous but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

258
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:12,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fix you can see it slows the overall</font>

259
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,360
convergence a little bit because you've

260
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,420
now got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more context switching but</font>

261
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,420
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually start to install the routes</font>

262
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,560
sounds good<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here's the problem oh</font>

263
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">my guess is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide that explains</font>

264
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything I understand here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

problem they don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to fix</font>

266
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,959
it they don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an issue so</font>

267
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,339
what they told me was to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find</font>

268
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,979
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who think that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue</font>

269
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:36,380
and get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say this is</font>

270
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,300
issue and we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone to solve it so</font>

271
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,310
if you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're right juniper</font>

272
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,370
routers to install routes into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB</font>

273
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,949
in less than you know multiple tens of

274
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:51,080
minutes go talk to your juniper account

275
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,520
team tell them PR 836 197 and tell them

276
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,990
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think this is a serious issue</font>

277
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should pay attention to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

278
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,250
resolve it's been going on for like five

279
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:08,839
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to care thank</font>

280
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:11,480
you and the final talk of the lightning

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,580
talk session will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ali Howard again</font>

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:22,130
this time he'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about ipv4</font>

283
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:23,990
address consumption hi remember me I was

284
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,000
here recently talking about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost of</font>

285
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,430
running dual stack and that was coming

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the talk the cost of carrier-grade</font>

287
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,620
NAT and the cost of addresses I've been

288
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,050
talking off a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost because</font>

289
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,220
that's sort of the way I think about the

290
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,890
trade-offs that engineers have to make

291
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,780
on building networks now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

292
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,730
so there's this address market who are

293
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,310
the potential buyers I have to be very

294
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,680
clear this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not time warner cable work</font>

295
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:53,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT signaling strategy if somebody</font>

296
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,339
knows our strategy let me know so the

297
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,710
motivations for this for the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

298
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,300
i'm doing here is I wanted to say if the

299
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,580
total<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of ownership carrier-grade</font>

300
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,099
net is so high<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are going to</font>

301
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,050
buy addresses instead of doing CGN how

302
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,520
high will demand be well let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

303
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,490
at where demand might come from let's go

304
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,720
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the largest networks and see how</font>

305
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,900
much address space they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

306
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,360
much address space they need ah now i

307
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,079
looked at the largest residential ISPs

308
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,120
and content providers and a CDN or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

309
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,740
really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to the transit</font>

310
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,150
providers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i apologize for the fact</font>

311
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,440
that i wasn't able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that included</font>

312
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,430
in time my shell scripting foo is weak

313
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,650
here's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the residential</font>

314
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,130
ISPs the four largest residential ISPs i

315
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:39,709
will name names i<font color="#E5E5E5"> downloaded the right</font>

316
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,240
views table cool stuff mmm i did some

317
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,550
grip that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the grep</font>

318
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,800
command that I used because there are

319
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,390
lots of switches in the order and yeah

320
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,439
so I did some gripping and

321
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:54,260
I did a show me from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Aaron who is</font>

322
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,360
who actually is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> registered holder of</font>

323
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,960
this address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space because I wanted to</font>

324
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I excluded customer</font>

325
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,650
routes so if you're running a network

326
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,970
and your originating a route for your

327
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,740
customer but it's actually their address

328
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,210
block that doesn't get included in how

329
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,680
much address space you hold because you

330
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:13,640
can't assign that to somebody else later

331
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,930
on right then I also did a visual grep

332
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,610
to say to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I was excluding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

333
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,199
and now I also made sure that I included

334
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,270
the subsidiaries that I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and I'm</font>

335
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,130
specifically in this case I knew of

336
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:27,050
several subsidiaries of verizon

337
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:28,730
including the ones listed here now the

338
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,170
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I looked at is the</font>

339
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,360
current number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of residential</font>

340
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,760
subscribers for each of these ISPs and

341
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,100
their growth rate i looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 2011</font>

342
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,130
annual reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dilute it so this is</font>

343
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,960
old its 2011 because the 2012 annual

344
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,330
reports aren't out yet for all of them

345
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,620
from any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them and they certainly</font>

346
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,210
weren't what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was actually doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

347
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,590
analysis so that's where this comes from

348
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is all public data you can</font>

349
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,740
reproduce this you can do your own

350
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,600
analysis I ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> please do this kind</font>

351
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,800
of analysis because I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

352
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,830
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one who's thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

353
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:02,359
this ready Shazam it's a lightning talk

354
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,300
so if you work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one of these four</font>

355
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,110
companies you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the column</font>

356
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,380
everybody else is probably looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

357
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,300
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rose so we start with how many</font>

358
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:15,110
addresses are routed by each of these

359
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,000
companies ATT has roughly 80 million 70

360
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,440
million 30 million 28 million those are

361
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,180
millions and millions of addresses

362
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,270
routed by these companies originated

363
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,130
from there a<font color="#CCCCCC"> esas mmm this is based on</font>

364
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,590
on route views on one particular day

365
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pulled for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> refuse from their</font>

366
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,300
annual reports in 2011 they had this

367
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,780
many millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers in</font>

residential internet users<font color="#E5E5E5"> their 2011</font>

369
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,160
growth rates<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now we start to say</font>

370
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,360
well I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get at how long do</font>

371
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,160
they have before they run out of

372
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,910
addresses and might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be potential buyers</font>

373
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,130
of address space 2011 18 th annual

374
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,980
report I read it twice it said they lost

375
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">5 million residential users well ok if</font>

376
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,830
you're losing 5 million users per year

377
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,360
you're never going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> round of ipv4</font>

378
00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:01,100
header space<font color="#CCCCCC"> comcast's looks like they</font>

379
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a significant number of address</font>

380
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,580
compared to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had a significant</font>

381
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,310
growth wonder where those five million

382
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,650
went so comcast has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a significant amount</font>

383
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of growth in 2011 but they still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

384
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,670
significant number of addresses and so

385
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,800
it's going to be some time potentially

386
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,990
before they run out of address space now

387
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other two it's there's a lot of</font>

388
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,920
variability in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you start to</font>

389
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,750
wonder what's the utilization ratio

390
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,750
right that's that's the real question is

391
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,520
how many users<font color="#E5E5E5"> / address do you get is</font>

392
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,960
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or how many addresses per user for</font>

393
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,610
residential subscriber you could

394
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,190
probably assume each residential

395
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,250
subscriber assuming native ipv4 each

396
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,200
residential subscriber gets one address

397
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,850
but you don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

398
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,400
aggregation level within each<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

399
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,500
and what's the full<font color="#CCCCCC"> ratio is there so I</font>

400
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,390
kind of took a swag and made some

401
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,530
numbers here please feel free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

402
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,830
whatever you want to with that

403
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:53,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">information it's really important that I</font>

404
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,480
highlight with the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

405
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:58,760
didn't include<font color="#E5E5E5"> I excluded voice</font>

406
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,110
customers and video customers because

407
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,480
even though they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be numbered at a</font>

408
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,250
public address space now they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

409
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,319
need to be numbered at a public address

410
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,369
SPECT oh so if you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> over-the-top</font>

411
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">voice or video great you if you're using</font>

412
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,489
one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public services</font>

413
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's on the internet that's an</font>

414
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,640
Internet application you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably need</font>

415
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,959
about public address to get there<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

416
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,980
some kind of transition technology

417
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,480
obviously if you're doing in-house

418
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,030
services maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not as a required so</font>

419
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,650
I decided I could exclude that your

420
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,590
mileage may vary there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

421
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:33,380
mileage may vary here I excluded

422
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,240
commercial customers because I couldn't

423
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">find any way even if i could find how</font>

424
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,110
many commercial customers a network has

425
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I couldn't find any way to correlate how</font>

426
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,490
many addresses per customer they might

427
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,320
be assigning again too much variability

428
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,510
I just couldn't figure it out I did

429
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,879
explicitly therefore exclude the

430
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,010
commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for verizon for instance</font>

431
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,630
because I knew that ASI me would I mean

432
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,490
that's where it came from but I can also

433
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,290
let you know that I saw another 25

434
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,540
million addresses coming from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 07 01 I</font>

435
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,550
also excluded the wireless business on

436
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,300
the grounds that separate network

437
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:09,290
separate customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> heileen added already</font>

438
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:10,970
and LTE includes ipv6 support in the

439
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,800
spec and we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see ipv6</font>

440
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,400
support through LTE deployments so

441
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,240
probably not

442
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,150
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm arguing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wireless won't</font>

443
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,850
be a major driver of a vibe I pv for

444
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:27,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">address consumption in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future more</font>

445
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,280
to go for content sites I picked some

446
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,550
that I liked that I said these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are big</font>

447
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,870
content sites or cd8 whatever they were

448
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:36,360
and I was looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> physically trying to</font>

449
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,860
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about big and growing networks to</font>

450
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,199
see where they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be going how many</font>

451
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,189
addresses they held again kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran</font>

out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time it's why I made it a</font>

lightning talk couldn't didn't have time

454
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,420
to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at the annual</font>

455
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,810
reports to figure out what the growth

456
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:53,370
rates were again did a bulk who is foo

457
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:55,290
and show me the net range and then for

458
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,719
each octet multiply the third octet by

459
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,120
255 addresses in the second octet by 255

by 255 in the first octet by 55 by 255

461
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,030
by 255 that's how I figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how many</font>

462
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:08,879
addresses a network had so they're so

463
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:11,040
here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go this really surprised me it</font>

467
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,919
addresses in that it turned out that

468
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,500
they have an awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of / 29 s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Swift</font>

didn't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the transit networks that</font>

how they're managing the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

significant um of addresses maybe not

483
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">even surprising but but one wouldn't</font>

484
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,139
expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization with few</font>

485
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:00,090
addresses would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a major driver of</font>

486

consumption in an ipv4 address market in

487
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:06,240
the future and when one other sort of

488
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,460
exclusion here is the 560,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> I listed</font>

489
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,840
for Microsoft does exclude the 600

490
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,760
whatever it was thousand addresses

491
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,639
acquired from nortel because they're not

492
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">all rounded yet they haven't all been</font>

493
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,470
re-registered so there's you know

494
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,640
there's some hard to measure hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

495
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,370
get in there and figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

496
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,810
addresses those were so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I left that out</font>

497
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,639
so Microsoft does have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than that</font>

498
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:30,970
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in the bank</font>

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,550
that's it Shazam that's where you go I

500
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,140
hope that's exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and informative for</font>
