1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:11,759
thank you very much so like to invite

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,190
Jim<font color="#CCCCCC"> cowie up here we had a panel</font>

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,389
yesterday with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center with some</font>

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,029
of the data center providers from the

<font color="#E5E5E5">New York area the mid-atlantic area</font>

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,880
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data center impacts of</font>

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hurricane sandy Jim is going to come up</font>

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">here with his panelists and talk about</font>

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,210
the actual more or less logical impacts

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,058
of what we saw in hurricane sandy I know

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,600
there's a graph in one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides</font>

12
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:38,820
in here that has the right backless

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,540
information in it and I was actually

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,309
stranded in London during<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandy and I'm</font>

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">I live in the northern New Jersey area</font>

16
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,690
and I got to see when my probe dropped

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,820
offline in that craft and came back on

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,709
and I could tell that my UPS actually

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,820
lasted for about four hours longer than

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,230
most of the other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my area so</font>

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,780
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting data I think they</font>

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:09,330
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to that we can all learn from</font>

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:18,509
in this so Jim laptops here for my

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:20,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfort very good hey everybody we're</font>

25
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,650
gonna have a great panel here this is a

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,330
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> two if you will of the superstorm</font>

27
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,340
sandy sandy saga which started yesterday

28
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,619
now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you saw yesterday was really</font>

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the very low level physical</font>

30
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,530
support the people who were really you

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,549
know waist-deep in salt water and diesel

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,200
fuel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and urea and whatever these are the</font>

33
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet researchers the internet</font>

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,960
measurement community they were in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

35
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,549
warm offices hundreds or thousands of

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,990
miles away probably with a cup of tea

37
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:59,070
their power didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> go out and they were</font>

38
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,789
collecting data on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> event so just by</font>

39
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,758
way of introduction I think yesterday

40
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,429
you saw a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information about</font>

41
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,979
the storm itself storm surge the clouds

42
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,769
the radar

43
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,319
the disasters that befell<font color="#CCCCCC"> Manhattan and</font>

44
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the surrounding regions so today we're</font>

45
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,260
going to look logically as Dave said at

46
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet and the impact here it has</font>

47
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,239
been said that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is the</font>

48
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">planet's most complex man-made system I</font>

49
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that that's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true and so</font>

50
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,530
this was a natural experiment it's we're

51
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,930
not happy when these things happen but

52
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,790
we do take advantage of them if you take

53
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,340
a big complex system it has billions of

54
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,319
people attached to it and nine layers of

55
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,150
abstraction and you want to find out

56
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,298
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will happen if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you turn off all the</font>

57
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,370
power in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the biggest cities that</font>

58
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,069
exchange is traffic you know we would

59
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,349
not probably request than anybody try

60
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:57,828
this in reality but<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it does happen</font>

61
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,869
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all spring to action and see what we</font>

62
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:02,120
can see from as many different vantage

63
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,680
points as we can so today you're going

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear a little bit of the fire hose of</font>

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,480
observation about what happens between

66
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:13,010
diesel fuel and and users up top so as

67
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,760
you listen to these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking</font>

68
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,760
because we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time for</font>

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,220
questions I hope how could these

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,620
measurements be useful to me to you the

71
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">network operators a lot of this will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

72
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,180
describing what we saw because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw it</font>

73
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,470
and if there are ways that this could be

74
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,269
useful to the Operations community

75
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,459
figuring out ways to respond better to

76
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:34,030
make these systems more resilient and

77
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:38,239
survivable we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

78
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:41,019
so a panelist today go in order we'll

96

of mine Lynn and<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI so our question is</font>

97
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,080
what can pings tell us about the degree

98
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:33,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">of outages that happen in in hurricane</font>

99
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,490
sandy and so in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we tell</font>

100
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,190
what happens at the edge of the

101
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">network's the customers to the people on</font>

102
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,250
the ground and ultimately our goal is to

103
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,350
understand can we track in general

104
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,419
networks across the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal</font>

105
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,979
and understand natural disasters and

106
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,409
also unfortunately understand human

107
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:54,080
disasters things like Egypt where things

108
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,180
were intentionally shut down to begin to

109
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,580
characterize the difference between long

110
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,160
outages and wide outages that is outages

111
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,750
that affect a few people for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time</font>

112
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus outages that affect a lot of</font>

113
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,720
people for a short time and to begin to

114
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus not just on routing in the core</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet but on the edge of the</font>

116
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,950
internet what happens to people in homes

117
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,120
and what happens inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ISPs see</font>

118
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,530
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the kind of questions we're</font>

119
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,419
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at in this work so the</font>

120
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:27,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">general approach of our work starts with</font>

121
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:29,060
pings and so we take a / 24 we ping a

122
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,389
bunch of addresses in it and watch over

123
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,100
time and basically our rule is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if</font>

124
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,660
they're all responding and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

125
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">sudden they stopped responding something</font>

126
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,820
happened and so we look for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> bands</font>

127
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,250
in this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of graph so each bar there</font>

128
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,719
is a size 24 the green dots represent

129
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,800
ping addresses that are responding to

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,610
ping there should be two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred fifty</font>

131
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,889
six of them in this experiment and when

132
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,610
you notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vertical black bar that's</font>

133
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:57,919
what we call an outage so from this we

134
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,289
process this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and detect outages for each</font>

135
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,240
block right the the times when things<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

136
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:07,880
down we then simplify this graph and

137
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,990
have one line<font color="#E5E5E5"> per every slice 24 and</font>

138
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,400
then there's you know there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

139
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,780
of size 24 is in the internet so we

140
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,489
cluster them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the lines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

141
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,960
that represents similar kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

142
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,030
behavior get clustered next to each

143
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,650
other in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our in our picture and that</font>

144
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,669
ends up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a picture like this oh and</font>

145
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we call them based on geolocation</font>

146
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,420
and so this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the bottom right</font>

147
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,580
shows you the kind of graphs we can

148
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,050
produce so that green blob in the middle

149
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,419
is the results of the Japanese

150
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,760
earthquake you can see there was an

151
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,490
earthquake the dates you can't quite see

152
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,920
the dates go across the x-axis and the

153
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">blocks across the y-axis and you can see</font>

154
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the earthquake took down a bunch of nets</font>

155
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,950
and then they sort of slowly came up

156
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:50,010
after the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple over the course of</font>

157
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,190
a couple of days<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's that's</font>

158
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,570
our experimental methodology so for the

159
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,490
data that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be talking today</font>

160
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:01,610
about sandy we're using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sample of</font>

161
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,590
41,000 / 24 s taken basically randomly

162
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,920
where we probe all addresses in each /

163
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,840
24 and basically that results in one

164
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,930
probe every few seconds to some address

165
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,510
in that size 24 so that's a fair amount

166
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,130
of traffic that's not something we're

167
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,530
comfortable doing with to the internet

168
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:23,159
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole and actually work in progress</font>

169
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,320
is is replacing this very detailed very

170
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,030
complete measurement with something

171
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's much much lighter weight about 1%</font>

172
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,929
of this traffic rate we think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font>

173
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,540
the kind of results will show you with

174
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,520
as few as about 15 probes / / 24 per

175
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,100
hour something that I think is well

176
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,930
below the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of background noise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% of</font>

the tech report if you're interested so

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,130
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad sandy so we were</font>

182
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,490
taking a survey of 41,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> sighs</font>

183
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:59,040
twenty-fours when Sandy hit the data set

184
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,140
is listed at the top when we pare that

185
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,480
down we find 11,000 of those were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

186
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:07,740
United States when we pare that down we

187
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,270
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4,100 of those had enough data that</font>

188
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,740
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for outages in them there</font>

189
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,020
there were enough IP addresses that were

190
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,590
responding that we could see this sharp

191
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:20,419
drop when when things shut down we

192
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:24,900
geolocator them using<font color="#CCCCCC"> max mind which is</font>

193
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,370
not ideal but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we have so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

194
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,650
located in the states you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the</font>

195
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,050
map on the right hand side 60 of them

196
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,760
end up on some unknown location in the

197
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,840
united states so that's that blob

198
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,539
floating out in the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

201
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:44,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-axis and networks go on the y-axis</font>

202
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,959
and then I works are all shuffled to

203
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,970
make the close ones out at things that

204
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,189
have outages in common times appear at

205
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,329
the same next to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and so what</font>

206
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,550
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see this is in UTC so the sandy</font>

207
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:58,959
made landfall it at midnight and what

208
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,449
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's a bunch of</font>

209
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,638
networks that go offline around shortly

210
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:05,319
after sandy makes landfall and you can

211
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,220
actually see it takes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while for them</font>

212
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:11,469
to to come back in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

213
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,120
quantify what we saw we look at the

214
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,100
marginal distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sophie in each</font>

215
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,800
column you sum up how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many blocks are</font>

216
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,120
down that tells you the percentage of

217
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,459
networks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they do</font>

218
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,819
down at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and so we'll look at</font>

219
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:26,619
that next so this graphic takes that

220
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,389
marginal distribution and blows it up

221
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,300
and shows each sample points each little

222
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:35,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">red dot is one of our observations 11</font>

223
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,990
minutes and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is before sandy</font>

224
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,850
about point O to percent of the blocks

225
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,350
we were observing were down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

226
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,610
because you know the you know it's a big

227
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,529
place there's always somebody doing

228
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,769
something so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of baseline</font>

229
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we typically see what happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

230
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:52,149
sandy makes landfall is jumps by a

231
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:55,990
doubles and this is looking just to the

232
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:58,089
United States / 24 s and so by this

233
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,709
claim we claim that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of</font>

234
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,930
outages doubled in the United States

235
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:04,239
when sandy made landfall now it's

236
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,370
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the outages the</font>

237
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,170
absolute rate of outages is still quite

238
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,930
small right the internet is pretty

239
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,630
resilient and New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the</font>

240
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,269
entirety of the United States but a

241
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,579
pretty significant uptick in outages the

242
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:20,260
other neat thing that we can see as we

243
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,060
look at this data is we can watch

244
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,949
recovery and you can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outage rate</font>

245
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,510
go down back down to baseline and it

246
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:31,569
takes about four days to get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

247
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,610
so so this is nice but but do we really

248
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:36,279
know this is sandy and so to answer that

249
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,110
question on the next slide we looked at

250
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,630
our geolocation data and looked at what

251
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,730
blocks were down and where were they and

252
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,230
so the light blue values in the middle

253
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this graph our new york and new</font>

254
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:51,100
jersey and so from<font color="#CCCCCC"> our data we can see</font>

255
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:52,900
the majority of this uptick is in

256
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,140
York in New Jersey so consistent with

257
00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:01,780
the where sandy made landfall or / where

258
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:04,680
networks are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then this picture</font>

259
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,390
actually places the blocks where we see

260
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,180
places the blocks that show outages that

261
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,610
we saw the top three pictures are at the

262
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,500
three days before sandy the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

263
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,020
pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the four days after landfall</font>

264
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,310
and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spark the spike in</font>

265
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,329
outages in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new york city area</font>

266
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,630
so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same data as in the prior</font>

267
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide just plotted on a map</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

268
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,160
that summarizes the work we're doing the

269
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,990
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> line is we believe that pings are</font>

270
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,060
a very effective tool to judge how the

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,430
edge networks are going out they're not

272

<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect of course but but give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

273
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,640
insight into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the magnitude of outages</font>

274
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,530
and the scope of recovery we're working

275
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get a deployable system because we're</font>

276
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,520
not comfortable putting three pings a

277
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,460
second into every at every block in the

278
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,470
internet and we're pretty close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

279
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,360
and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking forward to being</font>

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to track outages internet wide</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mainly in the ripe NCC service region</font>

314
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:50,130
and what we measure is paying straight

315
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:53,910
routes which which I'll cover in this

316
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:56,580
presentation we also do<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS HTTP ssl of</font>

317
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,890
course v4 and v6 and we do that towards

318
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,980
a couple of fixed destinations which are

319
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:06,120
internal to our the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ripe Atlas</font>

320
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,190
infrastructure so that means all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

321
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,870
probes measure towards these

322
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,920
destinations and these currently are the

323
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:16,320
root servers and data centers where we

324
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,660
host some of rap battles infrastructure

325
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,070
that's three currently and we have

326
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">user-defined measurements which is</font>

327
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,269
and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a user of ripe Atlas can</font>

328
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,730
can define themselves and the way that

329
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:34,570
goes is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by hosting one of these</font>

330
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices you actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gain credits and</font>

331
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,990
you can use these credits to make

332
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,389
measurements on this on this whole

333
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:48,449
system so by you give and take from from

334
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:51,120
the community resource as you will so

335
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:53,319
what was the right ballast team wants

336
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,240
from people here of course is to use

337
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,310
ripe Atlas and we want feedback on how

338
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,740
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it even better and so there I</font>

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stopped my sales pitch by a non</font>

340
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,930
salesperson and get back to what what

341
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:09,730
I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

342
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,739
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is hurricane sandy we produced a</font>

343
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:18,250
couple of laps articles and the URL

344
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:22,480
there is points to that first we had a

345
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:25,570
couple of ripe Atlas devices in the

346
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,290
affected area so we could actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

347
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:31,569
what these devices how their

348
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:35,139
connectivity was during the outage so

349
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:37,329
that's not measuring from the outside to

350
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,310
towards these destinations but actually

351
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:46,029
measuring from these from the affected

352
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:49,119
area out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the world and this actually</font>

353
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:55,079
showed shows what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw there so these</font>

354
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:59,260
are pings from about a dozen ripe Atlas

355
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:04,899
devices towards a destination in Germany

356
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:06,610
and every every strip chart has the

357
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:09,100
baseline is the minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT that we ever</font>

358
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,130
saw for this source and destination pair

359
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,370
and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes over then the rtt</font>

360
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,899
increased so you see a degraded

361
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,350
performance or at least for ping

362
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:23,680
measurements in orange<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I marked the</font>

363
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,350
sandy landfill and as you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

364
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the top three are a New Jersey probes</font>

365
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:33,100
and they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for for some time the</font>

366
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,649
middle part<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in New York City we had a</font>

367
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,410
couple there in data centers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stayed</font>

368
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:40,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">up</font>

369
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:42,800
but also a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> that went down and as</font>

370
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:44,779
for a reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also plotted the ones</font>

371
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,040
in Philadelphia that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had that all</font>

372
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:51,649
stayed up so we have a view from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

373
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,339
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the outside but we cannot</font>

374
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,959
really sort of we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have enough</font>

375
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,259
deployment to actually get very fine

376
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:06,289
granularity on what was what had an

377
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:10,220
outage where if you just go from the

378
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:14,289
devices in the affected area so what I

379
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:16,970
wanted to do next is sort of zoom out

380
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:19,669
like a macroscopic level and see if we

381
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:25,069
can actually do something more like like

382
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:29,270
a seismometer so where you actually have

383
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:31,549
some kind of a signal during like a

384
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,179
natural disaster that shows something

385
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:37,340
about the state of the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

386
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,950
actually you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like like</font>

387
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:43,340
this or it looks like it if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

388
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:46,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changes in path if you just start</font>

389
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:50,030
counting how much churn there was in the

390
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">treasured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path and a way to do that is</font>

391
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,168
to look for each source destination pair

392
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,070
where you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace route look at all</font>

393
00:17:54,169 --> 00:18:01,070
the IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go back in time for</font>

394
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,510
and I took eight hours look at all the

395
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,549
IP addresses that you saw in trace right

396
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:09,530
path for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this source destination pair</font>

397
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:11,750
and see if you find a new IP address and

398
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,520
I need these eight hours to account for

399
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,350
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> load balancing and all kinds of fun</font>

400
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,350
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jew network operators do</font>

401
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:25,658
and what you see then is something like

402
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:29,750
this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just counting how many</font>

403
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:33,080
paths changes I saw at a given time for

404
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:37,250
trade routes from all the ripe Atlas

405
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:40,100
probes to five destinations in Northern

406
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,490
America here and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see a</font>

407
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,350
baseline<font color="#E5E5E5"> from below 50 path changes for</font>

408
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,539
everybody on in the two days before

409
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:51,789
sandy an orange<font color="#CCCCCC"> again is sandy landfall</font>

410
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,729
and the day after there was flux<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

411
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:57,129
was churned there was stuff going on and

412
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:58,149
it died down after that again so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

413
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:01,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's pretty cool that you would</font>

414
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:05,168
actually see this from from at the

415
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:09,999
traceroute level a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of European</font>

416
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:12,549
targets same thing but graph is the

417
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:14,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolute amount of journey we saw is</font>

418
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,239
lower because we have less probes

419
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:22,479
deployed in the US and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help with</font>

420
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:26,379
that to make that better doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

421
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:30,220
trick on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the a s level so we just look</font>

422
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:32,728
at the path and just look what the a s

423
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:38,999
path was that we saw in the trade routes

424
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:43,929
and we you don't don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really see a</font>

425
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:45,460
pattern there so what what that what I

426
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:48,309
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means is that in the stuff</font>

427
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,259
that we measured most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> churn of</font>

428
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:52,330
the flux of the things that happened in

429
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:56,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network were internal to two</font>

430
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:58,779
autonomous systems and of course the

431
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,769
obligatory ipv6 slide and not the first

432
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:05,859
one of the day I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an ipv6 we</font>

433
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:09,729
actually see two sharp<font color="#E5E5E5"> peaks around</font>

434
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:13,239
midnight UTC of the 30th and 31st and

435
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:16,840
that is actually around the time when

436
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:20,309
one major ipv6 transit provider which

437
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,309
name has something to do with hurricanes

438
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">switch path so and that's that maybe</font>

439
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:30,580
tell something about how dominant that

440
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,289
player is in that market now assuming

441
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,580
back into New York a little bit and

442
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:41,320
seeing what do we see with regards to

443
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:42,820
path going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through New York again from</font>

444
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,229
all the ripe Atlas probes and in this

445
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,678
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a single destination in</font>

446
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:49,509
Amsterdam and just counting the number

447
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,080
of paths that go through New York and

448
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:56,679
also the number of paths that go through

449
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,889
the Ashburn Washington area and what you

450
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,019
can see so New York isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in red Ashburn</font>

451
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:03,159
is in blue here which you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

452
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">sandy landfall</font>

453
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,050
is that the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths dropped</font>

454
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:13,149
significantly but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also see</font>

455
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:15,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">that quite a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of paths remained there</font>

456
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:23,700
was quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of traffic still</font>

457
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:27,240
traversing New York here and trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

458
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:32,110
see what that looks like geographically

459
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:34,210
so using the same data as the same trade

460
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,159
routes from from the last graph so all

461
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,160
the right battles probes towards a

462
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:43,080
single destination in in Amsterdam in

463
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:47,020
this case it's it's this orange circle

464
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:49,270
and all the ripe Atlas probes in this on

465
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,970
this map are the downward pointing

466
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,820
triangles and I colored them based on if

467
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:58,420
they on if they went through New York or

468
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,550
not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gray ones didn't go</font>

469
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:06,700
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path didn't go through New</font>

470
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:08,800
York at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> red is they moved away from</font>

471
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,500
New York City<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you compare pre and</font>

472
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,280
post sandy blue is they kept going

473
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,530
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> New York</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> City and also funny is</font>

474
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,470
that there's the greens that's actually

475
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's before sandy hit they</font>

476
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,630
didn't go through New York but after

477
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:29,590
they apparently did so I don't know what

478
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:32,170
or how but I mean it we have a lot lots

479
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,939
of vantage points there so you find

480
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,220
these types of effects and also

481
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:40,450
interesting I think is to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font>

482
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:45,940
this destination up<font color="#CCCCCC"> till</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Australian</font>

483
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:47,860
Southeast Asia going to a destination

484
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,460
and amsterdam that traffic also

485
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:54,129
traversed New York so stuff happening in

486
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:58,840
New York affects large parts of the

487
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:02,150
world this is a same same visualization

488
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:06,620
for a destination in

489
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:09,530
in maryland's d would root server you

490
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,600
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went kept</font>

491
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:17,590
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through New York other paths moved</font>

492
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:19,969
away from New York so a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of things</font>

493
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,500
path or<font color="#E5E5E5"> nose notice will be more</font>

494
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:25,730
unstable the day after sandy landfall

495
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,190
stuff moved away from New York but not

496
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,690
completely but the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing thing</font>

497
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,050
actually is that everything kept or

498
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:38,720
everything the internet mostly kept

499
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:42,169
working so but there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a next time</font>

500
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,470
the Mayas were wrong the world in didn't

501
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,960
end in 2012 so what I'd really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

502
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear from from this audience is how ripe</font>

503
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,270
Atlas can serve you best<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next time</font>

504
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,970
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next event and one idea i</font>

505
00:23:53,270 --> 00:24:01,450
actually had based on the the panel

506
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:05,170
yesterday is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could crowdsource</font>

507
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:09,170
having more locations that we probe to

508
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:11,390
so asking data centers can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give me</font>

509
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:15,350
an IP address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can probe in you</font>

510
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:18,860
give us some some information like what

511
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:20,990
data center is what is and we just put

512
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">it up on our dashboards and we dedicate</font>

513
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,490
say 50 ripe Atlas probes towards the

514
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:28,219
destination and that will maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Safety's</font>

515
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,260
data center some some support calls and

516
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,580
people asking is your data center still

517
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,690
up your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center still up and they</font>

518
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,129
can just go look at dashboards like that

519
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,860
so that's that's an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had there and</font>

520
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,620
I'd be very interested to hear people's

521
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:48,760
opinions about that and now or after the

522
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,760
session so that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me thank you</font>

523
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">thanks ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I take questions probably at</font>

524
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,560
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have so it's interesting here</font>

525
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,240
you start to see how New York becomes a

526
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">linchpin not just for connectivity to</font>

527
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,940
New York but lots of stuff goes through

528
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,560
New York so Doug's next see I my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is</font>

529
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,150
Doug<font color="#E5E5E5"> midori I'm an analyst</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with Renesys</font>

530
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,399
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be our take on the</font>

531
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:13,720
impacts of superstorm sandy on in global

532
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,130
connectivity so the day after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

533
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,780
hurricane we

534
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,190
published a blog detailing routing

535
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,230
outages where they were by state and

536
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,300
over time that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not what I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

537
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,710
talk focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on today but if that's of</font>

538
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,830
interest to you I refer you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our blog</font>

539
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,230
there today and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

540
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,909
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we gained out of our using</font>

541
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,880
our global traceroute infrastructure so

542
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,710
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own servers in about eight</font>

543
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 86 cities around the world that</font>

544
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,600
are tracing the entire internet at least

545
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,720
one time<font color="#E5E5E5"> of day and from there we can</font>

546
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,149
gain a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths knowledge of how</font>

547
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,870
traffic is actually passing through

548
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:54,500
providers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet so looking at</font>

549
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:57,070
traces that go into New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> after sandy</font>

550
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:00,860
made landfall again like the other

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,450
speakers here we saw drop off and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

where I'm estimating landfill is

556
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,320
obviously the hurricane wasn't a occur

557
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,850
at a single time but just as a frame of

558
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,100
reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where where we were in</font>

are going to not complete so it's not a

568
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,210
surprise what we thought was a when I

569
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,159
when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on this after</font>

570
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,750
right after the hurricane I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

571
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,900
a more interesting question<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be how</font>

572
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:53,300
was how did the loss of a critical<font color="#CCCCCC"> node</font>

573
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:57,200
of the internet affect a traffic going

574
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,430
from from a non-us place to a non-us

575
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,870
place because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font>

576
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,830
always have a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciation for how</font>

577
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:05,870
much traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through New York</font>

578
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,490
and so overall an aggregate from all

579
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,250
those places<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did see a dip and how</font>

580
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,770
many traces were traversing traversing

581
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,690
New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> from outside the US to outside</font>

582
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,820
the US and I through Canada in there as

583
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:21,830
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're going to have some</font>

584
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:25,429
similar international transit so we look

585
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:27,770
at a couple examples of this so one of

586
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">these is first one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> starting from</font>

587
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,129
Chicago which isn't

588
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,809
obviously outside the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> but outside the</font>

589
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:34,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside the Northeast certainly outside</font>

590
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:36,678
of New York so starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Chicago</font>

591
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:40,580
heading<font color="#E5E5E5"> east towards Europe and Asia we</font>

592
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,919

594
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,970
a dip and traces that are going through

00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:49,519
New York and we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> missing chunk</font>

596
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,009
and look and analyze it on the the graph

597
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,019
on the right and here we're seeing you

<font color="#E5E5E5">know what what changed in this and this</font>

599
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:59,929
in these traces so we see a shift from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

600
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,899

604
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,440

and traces going through New York the I

00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:01,549
little hard to see by the way if there's

645
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,330
the background stories of these would be

646
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,820
interesting to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what was so</font>

647
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,960
I don't know what what data center

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">fascinating story for a lot of these</font>

652

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,439
here of traces that we're going through

00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:28,100
New York we look at where those traces

655
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,840
you know where what the shift was in

656
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,330
there on the right side<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see that they</font>

this one's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complex a</font>

663
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,279
lot of previous stuff I've try to choose

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,950
simple things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain</font>

665
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,200
this one's a little bit harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow</font>

666
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,350
but bear with me so these are traces

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,809
starting from our server in in jeddah

pinning the bottom band is hair painting

677

00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:14,510
within the providers and I think found

720
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,668
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and I think events like</font>

721
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,020
these help us understand better

722
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:19,880
understand how providers handle

723
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:22,340
disruptions and other connectivity

724
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,330
challenges and we we learned a lot out

725
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,330
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

726
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:37,230
very nice and so last but not least

727
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:38,850
certainly Patrick tell us about who's

728
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,290
you know paying and traceroute Saul very

729
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,320
well and good but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's see some actual</font>

730
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:47,940
users will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see some user data everybody</font>

731
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:51,560
I'm Patrick this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tigger everybody was</font>

732
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ticker right okay just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> checking so uh</font>

733
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,620
Jim started this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with these</font>

734
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys are internet researchers he wasn't</font>

735
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't research</font>

736
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:02,550
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mostly go to conferences and</font>

737
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:04,620
drink but I do have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people at</font>

738
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:08,880
Akamai who do some research and they

739
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,918
look up data about what Akamai serves we

740
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,270
as you probably know have a large

741
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,100
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> of servers all around the world</font>

742
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:18,600
and we serve lots of traffic to various

743
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:20,040
and sundry people on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet just</font>

744
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
to be so that you understand this is the

745
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,969
exact opposite of what these guys are

746
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,159
doing there the rest of these panels are

747
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:28,109
doing things like checking out from

748
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,710
outside seeing if something pings in

749
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:33,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying if seeing if a prefixes up or</font>

750
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,649
seeing if a traceroute moves the only

751
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,419
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be showing here is</font>

752
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:38,370
actual traffic that Akamai serve to

753
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,649
actual end users so things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

754
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,299
requested this means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance</font>

755
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:45,089
of a network provider keeps<font color="#CCCCCC"> a provide</font>

756
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,310
gives a prefix up but all the users are

757
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:49,260
flooded out or out of the movies or

758
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything else we won't see the traffic</font>

759
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,710
so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little harder to tease out</font>

760
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:57,870
exact data but I think there's something

761
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show here so as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said it's a little</font>

762
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:03,150
hard to see the effects of the exact

763
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,520
effects sandy was not an atomic event

764
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,040
right landfall happened at a certain

765
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,960
time but different networks different

766
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,040
providers different kolos different

767
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,840
houses were affected at different times

768
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fact there's actually some effect</font>

769
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,250
before sandy ever maids now landfall

770
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,799
because coned was turning power off

771
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:25,050
proactively you gotta love<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when your</font>

772
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,750
electricity provider decides to shut off

773
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> power before it accidentally stops</font>

774
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:32,130
but anyway to help try and show this i'm

775
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to show a bunch of graphs that are</font>

776
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,270
five days in length<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can see a day</font>

777
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,049
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day of and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple days</font>

778
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:42,150
after so you can kind of get an idea of

779
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:44,580
the before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and after see how the effect</font>

780
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i put a red line</font>

781
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,350
through midnight east coast time which

782
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:51,680
apparently was a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> because sandy</font>

783
00:35:49,350 --> 00:36:00,120
made landfall at midnight UTC but

784
00:35:51,680 --> 00:36:04,799
nobody's perfect next so just a little

785
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:07,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit about the graph information is on</font>

786
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,880
the geography level so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i broke it out by</font>

787
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,020
state or somebody broke it out by state

788
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,340
for me just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be clear I didn't</font>

789
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually do this work I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just get to</font>

790
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and talk about the graphs</font>

791
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:18,480
so we have a bunch of individual states

792
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,580
and we geolocate the IP addresses of the

793
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">end users reaching the Akamai network we</font>

794
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,440
did not we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not care where the server</font>

795
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,970
was that was serving this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if server</font>

796
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,980
in New Jersey is serving somebody in New

797
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,470
York we use the IP address of the end

798
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">user in New York as the destination and</font>

799
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:36,480
that's what the graph is for I took off

800
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,820
the y-axis is to protect the guilty and

801
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,140
so my lawyers wouldn't yell at<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but I</font>

802
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,030
made sure that all the graphs that are

803
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">side by side so if you see two things</font>

804
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,840
left and<font color="#E5E5E5"> right they have the same y axis</font>

805
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,300
so you can see the same scale there's no

806
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,700
change in scale there there is a change

807
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,810
in scale from slide to slide but all the

808
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,330
ones that are next to each other have

809
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,850
the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same scale enough details</font>

810
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:58,319
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of graphs that I was given</font>

811
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was all like do we have any data and</font>

812
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,850
somebody like plastid me this PDF with

813
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,530
like hundreds of graphs in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

814
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,910
just some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I tried to copy</font>

815
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,890
and paste couldn't even fit it on the

816
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,960
slide because it was so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of them</font>

817
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,299
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of overlapped him but you</font>

818
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,900
can see we have lots of fun data and we

819
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,090
know you know lots of things like which

820
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,460
verticals of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers are served in</font>

821
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,630
which states and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> which time so I</font>

822
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,720
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick out some things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

823
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,640
useful first thing I did is I took eight

824
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,279
states on the united states east coast

825
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,529
from maine down to virginia that's a

826
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,840
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to read the the tops there</font>

827
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,950
but the slides will be posted and you

828
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,380
can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red line like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

829
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,450
midnight<font color="#CCCCCC"> east coast not midnight UTC but</font>

830
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,410
the same idea holds that it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

831
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:46,620
sandy was hitting land and these eight

832
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,640
states don't show a big difference sorry

833
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,380
some of the lines are kind of flat

834
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,470
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to keep the scale the same</font>

835
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,910
so some

836
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,230
the smaller states like New Hampshire

837
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,359
doesn't have as much traffic as

838
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,040
Massachusetts so the scale is a little

839
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,330
different but it still shows there

840
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,220
wasn't a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of effect for these</font>

841
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,859
eight states across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. eastern</font>

842
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,680
seaboard but if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> drill down a little</font>

843
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:07,690
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> further into just new york and new</font>

844
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,569
jersey these two states for obvious

845
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:15,670
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> were a little harder hit traffic</font>

846
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:17,200
is clearly affected this is the scale is

847
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,220
correct there's a white line at the

848
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,319
bottom that you probably can't see

849
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,049
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero and so if you just look</font>

850
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,340
there's essentially each white line is a

851
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,260
third of the traffic so you dropped

852
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,660
approximately thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty-five percent</font>

853
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,720
of traffic and it's a very clear and

854
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:35,830
obvious change everything goes down and

855
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:38,950
it stays that way for days so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font>

856
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:41,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">found I think we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

857
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,609
says this is more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just prefixes</font>

858
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,869
going down<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something there's real end</font>

859
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:48,098
user impact here interestingly some

860
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:51,460
segments of our customers actually

861
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:54,430
increased traffic I picked<font color="#CCCCCC"> out this one</font>

862
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,720
is called financial services vertical I

863
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,480
don't actually pick which customers go

864
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,799
into which vertical but it's kind of

865
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,330
obvious what this is a bunch of banks

866
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,710
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the banking</font>

867
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,869
customers actually saw more traffic

868
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,390
after sandy hit at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in new york and</font>

869
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">new jersey it's not quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear but in</font>

870
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">New York there's more traffic to</font>

871
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,440
financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> services after sandy hit so</font>

872
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:15,700
I'm a little was a little confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

873
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,230
that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess it makes a</font>

874
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit of sense New York is very you</font>

875
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,260
know financial centric a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

876
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,540
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move money I guess because</font>

877
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's damage I don't know but there</font>

878
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:28,359
are some actual increases here there

879
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,790
were four verticals as we call them for

880
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:32,220
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that increased financial services</font>

881
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:36,279
i guess you can kind understand that

882
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:38,200
travel hotel sites duh I wonder why that

883
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,140
increase right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of interesting</font>

884
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:45,160
everybody's asleep in my too monotone

885
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:47,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">hello who is checking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so hotel</font>

886
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,839
sites went up sandy hits when people go

887
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:51,250
to a hotel site in book a hotel who here

888
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,960
is surprised by that anybody anyway

889
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:55,390
interestingly you know things like

890
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">travel airplanes were not going up it</font>

891
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:01,390
still went out<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy utilities also saw</font>

892
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,799
increased traffic again not terribly

893
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,069
surprising right you're out of

894
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">electricity you go to the web</font>

895
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,979
coned and figure out when it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

896
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:10,130
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> since there's one who turned</font>

897
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:13,788
you off there's also a<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote unquote</font>

898
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,959
vertical called miscellaneous<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

899
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,249
know what's in it doesn't really matter

900
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,538
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's literally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an order of</font>

901
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:20,448
magnitude less traffic than any other

902
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:21,709
vertical so there there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> drips and</font>

903
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:23,390
drabs of little stuff that went up a

904
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:26,288
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit but these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only four</font>

905
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:30,469
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that went up after sandy hit</font>

906
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:32,150
everything else every other thing in our

907
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:34,729
database everything we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

908
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,349
every graph I could find<font color="#CCCCCC"> was now they</font>

909
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:40,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't even even they were clearly just</font>

910
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:42,979
down so sandy hadn't effects on more

911
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,690
than just prefixes I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly if</font>

912
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:47,149
people wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a certain site</font>

913
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:51,079
like finance like hotels like<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilities</font>

914
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:53,690
they could and they did but everything

915
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:58,670
else was down so this actually probably

916
00:40:53,690 --> 00:41:01,069
shows in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion something more than</font>

917
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:03,589
just the power outages something more

918
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:05,930
than just you know the data center

919
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:07,969
offline this shows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> human side of</font>

920
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:10,549
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with sandy because if</font>

921
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:11,839
you you know if your iphone is working

922
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:13,609
then you can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

923
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,828
and you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for only what's important</font>

924
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:17,269
and then you find out a hotel and then

925
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:19,609
you go and pack your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and you move</font>

926
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:21,439
and it has not you doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

927
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:23,209
whether or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> your prefixes up or</font>

928
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,009
whether you your traceroute goes through

929
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:27,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">london or not what matters is that</font>

930
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:28,910
people needed the internet for certain

931
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:31,039
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they could still use it which</font>

932
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:32,690
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really gratifying to me and gives me</font>

933
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,940
warm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fuzzies to know that you know</font>

934
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,469
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who had a real problem could</font>

935
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,209
still use the internet could still do

936
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:40,219
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they needed but then</font>

937
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:43,729
when they didn't need it they packed up

938
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:45,319
and left and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not terribly</font>

939
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:47,538
surprising if you think about it as a

940
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:49,910
person instead of as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer so</font>

941
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:54,640
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what I draw from the</font>

942
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,640
superstorm effect and I think that's it

943
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:09,740
awesome so there you have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with four</font>

944
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:11,960
perspectives I guess you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

945
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,549
left looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it you say well it's as</font>

946
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,910
as I think we were asking questions

947
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:20,660
yesterday we said the power goes out

948
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,098
internet goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but overall once</font>

949
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,509
you get beyond the local effects that

950
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:26,450
are documented<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> places where</font>

951
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:28,099
people have no power it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to</font>

952
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,269
see how well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did I think you know if</font>

953
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:32,900
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst that global warming</font>

954
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:36,470
can can bring us I say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know bring it</font>

955
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,509
on I guess we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take questions at this</font>

956
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,279
point I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear any thoughts that</font>

957
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:42,769
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys might have about the data</font>

958
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:43,970
you've seen here or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of the</font>

959
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,558
operators would like to stand up

960
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,868
courageously as the gentleman did

961
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:49,339
yesterday and admit to having swung

962
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:58,249
massive amounts of traffic around the

963
00:42:49,339 --> 00:43:02,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">planet as you saw in the graphs all</font>

964
00:42:58,249 --> 00:43:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">right please get identify yourself sandy</font>

965
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:07,390
Murphy Sparta and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

966
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:18,190
reverse sort of question<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security</font>

967
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:20,569
protections in BGP I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always wonder if</font>

968
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:25,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">the security protections are making</font>

969
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:28,400
things harder to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible so we have</font>

970
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:34,269
many different projects which will send

971
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:37,819
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> an alert if your prof your prefixes</font>

972
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:39,558
anomalous behavior it gets originated by

973
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:41,150
someone else or the path changes or

974
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:44,329
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw in one of the</font>

975
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,970
presentations a suggestion that routes

976
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:49,160
that had never been seen before suddenly

977
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:51,499
appeared and there was a suggestion that

978
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,339
this was a backup route and people build

979
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:58,609
prefix filters on you know daily basis

980
00:43:54,339 --> 00:44:01,210
any sign whatsoever that any of those

981
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:07,190
security protections were hampering the

982
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:08,380
response to the incident interesting

983
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,650
anybody

984
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,960
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might have been my slide as</font>

985
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:17,079
far as like identifying a alternate

986
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,569
route perhaps now those were traceroute

987
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:23,019
base and they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing base so as</font>

988
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:24,819
far as like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP based alert or they</font>

989
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:26,919
wouldn't have been one the fact that the

990
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:29,140
paths often just stay the same and the

991
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,990
the rerouting was happening internal to

992
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:34,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">a provider actually every one of the</font>

993
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:39,549
cases that I've got in this presentation

994
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:41,618
those were happening internal so I guess

995
00:44:39,549 --> 00:44:46,269
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any evidence Norma aware of</font>

996
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:49,450
any that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh that those types of security</font>

997
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:52,118
mechanisms were hampering anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

998
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:53,769
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you is there something</font>

999
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:58,450
specific you were hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in the</font>

1000
00:44:53,769 --> 00:45:01,000
data no I was hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an absence of</font>

1001
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,788
impact from security protections on and

1002
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,410
I asked the question knowing that if the

1003
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:08,769
answer turned out bad it was going to be

1004
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:10,720
bad for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

1005
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:14,200
absence of evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah good as far</font>

1006
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,919
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think so so our specific it is</font>

1007
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-to-end to try to include that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

1008
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,000
possibility that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we measure but I can't</font>

1009
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:24,430
distinguish it and that might be a

1010
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,950
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask the audience they</font>

1011
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,288
presumably know if they were him he did

1012
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:35,319
doing their work because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1013
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:39,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks Dan magesh oh sorry sorry I</font>

1014
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a reverse question to you sandy</font>

1015
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:45,099
hope you don't mind what might actually

1016
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,259
be interesting is to see from your data

1017
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:52,119
if you send out these alerts if you saw

1018
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:55,410
an increase due to an event like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I</font>

1019
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:55,410
don't know if you looked at that or

1020
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:02,529
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah okay none of the projects i</font>

1021
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,250
mentioned that do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of thing or</font>

1022
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:08,529
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so its various</font>

1023
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,390
different you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> their been lots and</font>

1024
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:12,250
lots of nano presentations of different

1025
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,660
projects that have that as a focus they

1026
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,730
look at the routing history the attempt

1027
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:21,098
to identify some sort of anomalous

1028
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:22,240
behavior and send a lower right Larry in

1029
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:25,210
recess one I

1030
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,859
I didn't look at that data but yeah we

1031
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:28,990
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at I didn't look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

1032
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:32,320
but I mean if there's some correlation

1033
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:33,700
between between<font color="#E5E5E5"> an event like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

1034
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,060
and and these alerts if they are

1035
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,890
specific to do routing security then

1036
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,930
that's of course interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

1037
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:45,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bennett it's sort of an evidence that it</font>

1038
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:49,330
does have an effect there right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1039
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:55,750
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks yes dan McGann pure one</font>

1040
00:46:49,330 --> 00:47:00,130
networks just can you speak a little

1041
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:03,430
closer Mike no yelling into this thing

1042
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:05,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go sorry dan McGann</font>

1043
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:08,169
pierwszy networks just humor the group

1044
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:09,940
i'm one of the operators who was

1045
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,380
affected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and you guys are</font>

1046
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering what happened with some of</font>

1047
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,910
these networks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll tell a quick</font>

1048
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">little story we have a presence at 75</font>

1049
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:23,529
broad and 60 hudson 75 broad was a bit

1050
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:25,960
of a nightmare with power issues when we

1051
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">advertise routes through to our transits</font>

1052
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,210
we generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise the whole region</font>

1053
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:33,240
not just the city so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we knew</font>

1054
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:36,420
that 75 broad was going to be affected

1055
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:40,569
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertised routes for adjacent cities</font>

1056
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,250
through transit in 75 broad one of the

1057
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">first things that we did was we stop</font>

1058
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:47,230
advertising those routes out of transits

1059
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,170
in that city or specifically that data

1060
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,550
center we were told repeatedly that

1061
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:55,359
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose power any minute now</font>

1062
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:58,780
which was sort of frustrating after we

1063
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,790
basically made that adjustment we were

1064
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,100
at the point where we're debating making

1065
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:06,310
is is metric adjustments which would

1066
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:09,250
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of avoid sort of the the New York</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">high-risk area we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that was</font>

1068
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:14,250
pretty much not necessary because of the

1069
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:19,300
rate of fell over being what it is and

1070

part apology the 60<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hudson site</font>

1071
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:25,210
basically remained stable route

00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:27,250
advertisements were<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweets lightly just</font>

1073
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:29,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that we weren't advertising as many</font>

1074

1075

as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result we're depending more heavily</font>

00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:39,359
on pops and places nearby like

1077
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:41,280
for Virginia things like that the

1078
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,160
overall results were<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could see some</font>

1079
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,560
pretty staggering traffic shifts on our

1080
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,410
backbone and as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure when</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys do all your probes you'd see</font>

1082
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:55,259
the traceroute adjustments have been

1083
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:56,550
made but the actual service impact was

1084
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,970
something that just due to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1085

robustness<font color="#CCCCCC"> of networking technologies it</font>

1086

was really not there other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than when the</font>

1087
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:10,828
actual end users lost power thank you

1088
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,319
good observation i know that when we

1089
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:15,690
when we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it was Doug's plots</font>

1090
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:17,430
that showed some of the different colors

1091
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:19,200
for different providers are different

1092
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:21,960
cities as traffic was swinging the

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,700

1096
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:30,480
right even though you were swinging a

1097
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:33,049
lot of traffic the experience of the

1098
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,750
prefixes at the ends was probably not

1099
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:39,180
very different it's surprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

1100
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:43,140
little these alternative paths you know

a manish from DHS cybersecurity division

1104
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,740
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions I had for the</font>

1105
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:59,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">panelists is a lot of the data presented</font>

1106
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:02,129
here is post analysis now have have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1107
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys learned any any insights from your</font>

1108
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:06,960
analysis which which you're hoping to

1109
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:10,079
apply for example in an ongoing way for

1110
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,000
example to detect micro outages large

1111
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,680
outages you know everybody sees a bump

1112
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,530
in some form or another but it's the

1113
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,299
micro outages which which can often be

1114
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:20,160
very difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot and is there are</font>

1115
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">there any lessons learned from your</font>

1116
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,200
analysis here that would apply to those

1117
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,939
well for one I'd like to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

1118
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:33,000
deeper into sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a path changes</font>

1119
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually mind I mean from</font>

1120
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,560
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get like IP addresses that you</font>

1121
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,069
can geo locate or you can do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds</font>

1122
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:43,740
of fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> things where you can actually see</font>

1123
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:46,920
stuff in London not technically an

1124
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:49,319
outage but stuff in the middle changing

1125
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,690
that is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily see</font>

1126
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:55,470
otherwise and that is I think something

1127
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:57,390
interesting to further look into and one

1128
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:59,399
other thing that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is sort</font>

1129
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:02,098
of make stuff more more real-time so

1130
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:08,730
next time you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dashboard type</font>

1131
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:10,950
functionality hopefully so in in the

1132
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:14,849
data we presented we focused on sandy

1133
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:17,430
which was a macro outage but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the</font>

1134
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:18,900
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've looked at shows</font>

1135
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:21,078
it's very critical that we establish a

1136
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,520
baseline how much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the u.s. is down</font>

1137
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:26,520
regularly and I think including micro

1138
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,099
outages is essential in that and in fact

1139
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:32,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">a really important question for the</font>

1140
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:38,010
operator community is can is there any

1141
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:41,490
insight into sub routable prefix outages

1142
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:43,230
that you can share<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know I</font>

1143
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:44,970
have data and I have estimates and I

1144
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:49,170
built I know how i compute them I

1145
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:51,359
believe them but the extensive analysis

1146
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:54,569
over the last 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> on routable</font>

1147
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:57,299
prefixes we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an analog to that</font>

1148
00:51:54,569 --> 00:52:00,450
when you get to smaller outages yet we

1149
00:51:57,299 --> 00:52:02,759
know you know as examples you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1150
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:07,259
the last speaker that there is stuff

1151
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:08,700
that happens inside of of ISPs and I'd

1152
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">love to give a better visibility into</font>

1153
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,558
that i might add 10 sir did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it</font>

1154
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:17,339
so essentially what you're saying is

1155
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:20,040
some ground truth validation would would

1156
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:21,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">be very helpful yeah and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1157
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,690
how to get that other than other than

1158
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:27,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">from you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys I just add one comment</font>

1159
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:29,940
there so you know we did our initial

1160
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:31,980
blog on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impacts we we actually do</font>

1161
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,079
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a continuous you know</font>

1162
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,220
identification of outages mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1163
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,900
are routing outages but we can do this

1164
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">for trace right as well I think when you</font>

1165
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to a now specific you're thinking of</font>

1166
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:43,379
micro but if it's a single IP that was

1167
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,119
responding yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is not</font>

1168
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:47,700
responding today it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to</font>

1169
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,049
make a conclusion that there's an outage

1170
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,450
or this thing was turned off there's a

1171
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:53,700
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that could happen it gets</font>

1172
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:58,020
this conclusion gets stronger as you see

1173
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:59,330
a larger impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> across maybe across the</font>

1174
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,190
whole provider or cross

1175
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:03,560
a series providers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same geography</font>

1176
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:07,640
then things there's more evidence to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1177
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:10,430
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of but we we log these things as</font>

1178
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,040
they are happening and and so that's

1179
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:16,460
that's how we were able to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1180
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,170
report on hours after the event so

1181
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:20,240
there's so there's one other thread<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1182
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,860
wanted to pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you mentioned most</font>

1183
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,899
of what was presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> was post facto</font>

1184
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,880
analysis I think that's I think that's

1185
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,160
true<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the board right it certainly</font>

1186
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,610
took us about a month to pull together

1187
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,310
the data analysis I think a key

1188
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:36,140
challenge going forward is can we get to

1189
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:38,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where we can provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font>

1190
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of analysis that you saw in much closer</font>

1191
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:44,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time I can imagine 15 minutes</font>

1192
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:47,180
delay or so and start to use this not

1193
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:49,040
just to so what happened story but start

1194
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:54,649
to use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of what is happening and</font>

1195
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:58,190
where should we send the fuel trucks yes

1196
00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:03,410
sir Brian Dixon<font color="#CCCCCC"> garrison labs at a</font>

1197
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:07,760
previous job I was involved in a carrier

1198
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:10,609
that used a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of satellite and just go</font>

1199
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,770
into the latency that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was seen when you</font>

1200
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:16,040
go geosynchronous you expect each

1201
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:18,580
direction to add 280 milliseconds so

1202
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,900
you'd expect if there's a bi-directional

1203
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:22,940
round-trip time that would jump at about

1204
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:29,000
five hundred and 60 milliseconds so

1205
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:31,760
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably seeing satellite just</font>

1206
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,540
FYI okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we do see satellite in</font>

1207
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,010
fact that i've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lightning talk</font>

1208
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,080
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this afternoon with</font>

1209
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:37,700
inclusive satellite analysis of latency

1210
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,770
so you'll see those the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same observation</font>

1211
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,410
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I've got included in there but</font>

1212
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:48,440
yeah it could be satellite that's true

1213
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:51,740
so I don't know good I think we have

1214
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:55,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">reached the oh I've got one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1215
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:57,620
question sure dave swanson with

1216
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:59,450
windstream we had a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sizable</font>

1217
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,730
presence in lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> manhattan that day and</font>

1218
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">i guess to kind of answer some of the</font>

1219
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,990
questions about seeing the traffic

1220
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,759
shifts we had to move a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

1221
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:09,859
from like a counterclockwise path over

1222
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,660
to a clockwise path do to you know

1223
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:13,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">losing 75 broad and losing the</font>

1224
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:17,060
particular past one<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that direction so</font>

1225
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:18,589
a lot of the anomalies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you would</font>

1226
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen we're not necessarily</font>

1227
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,440
unreachable prefixes would have occurred

1228
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,660
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen a spike in</font>

1229
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,010
latency and then a drop could have been

1230
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">attributed things like that that was</font>

1231
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:29,690
stuff that I ran into directly that day

1232
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:31,100
where I'd have to pull traffic off this

1233
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,930
route over here on the right move it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1234
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:35,870
this traffic this path on the Left where

1235
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:37,279
the end result was the same but it

1236
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,930
definitely made some stuff live in the

1237
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,970
process so what's the clockwise

1238
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:42,649
counterclockwise is that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the layout</font>

1239
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just basically a ring you know you</font>

1240
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,930
have a gate would go a couple hundred

1241
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">miles this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direction versus what we're</font>

1242
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:48,799
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go couple hundred miles that</font>

1243
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,150
direction so there were there was a lot

1244
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:53,600
of shifts like that that took place that

1245
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:55,850
day at least on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> network good thanks</font>

1246
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:59,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that I think you know all of us so</font>

1247
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:01,009
go so so question for the audience so

1248
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:04,340
we've heard a lot about the heroic

1249
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:06,260
efforts at tweaking routing to to keep

1250
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,780
things up and to get transit traffic and

1251
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:11,390
we saw some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1252
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:15,040
curious if you guys have any comments or

1253
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:19,700
war stories for those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's because because if the if the CEO</font>

1257
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,720
to get those bits through or if the if

1258
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:32,120
the end user doesn't have power I'm

1259
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,819
curious if you had a feedback from your

1260
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:40,490
customers about that or if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

1261
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:42,140
you measured that seems good I able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

find all of us at coffee and tell us

your deepest darkest stories about this

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really does work best when you</font>

match internet measurement with

00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,280
objective reality from the operators so

1269

thank the<font color="#E5E5E5"> panel with me</font>
