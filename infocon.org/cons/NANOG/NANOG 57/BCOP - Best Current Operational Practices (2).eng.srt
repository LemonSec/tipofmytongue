13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,850
a lot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,110
history so first that the problem

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">statement is fairly straightforward</font>

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,440
right there are some their presentations

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,690
given all over the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kinds of</font>

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,550
operator forums and there are like you

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">know fifty to a hundred little operator</font>

20
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,010
forums and each presentation is regional

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,650
and relevant at the time that it is

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented and once it's presented their</font>

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,540
typically archived on the respective

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,340
operator site as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> power point they</font>

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,830
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally have any audio with them</font>

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,090
or any translated text and you have no

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,610
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> as to whether or not their</font>

28
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,049
currents after their archived you know

29
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically as soon as the presentations</font>

30
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,770
given it it you know someone could do

31
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,539
something different or better that is

32
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,250
well vetted and makes it current so the

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,310
scenario is that an organization whether

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,200
they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> here or they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font>

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,759
an operator out in the world who doesn't

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,740
participate in these meetings it's

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,240
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem they attempt</font>

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,369
to search for the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,520
operational practice or the best method

40
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,140
of implementing a solution on your you

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,429
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite qualified search engine</font>

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of</font>

43
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,860
information so it's really hard to tell

44
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,899
what's accurate what's currents and

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,549
moreover what's been vetted right there

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,259
are lots of data out there that we have

47
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,149
no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just some Schmucks</font>

48
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,159
opinion or if they're you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">subject matter expert leader in the</font>

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:13,310
world so how does the searcher know if

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,310
its current valid etc

52
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,839
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a bunch of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

53
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we've tried a</font>

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,650
few different ways and looked at a bunch

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,349
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different methodologies one of which</font>

56
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,840
is that we could figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way to tie</font>

57
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:29,480
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the given regional operator forms</font>

58
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,310
into a single searchable archive you

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,260
know ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the operator</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forms to</font>

60
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,239
record every single presentation getting

61
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,440
translated into text and make that

62
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,519
available to the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

63
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,310
decide yourself when you're searching

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a solution or two as we could build</font>

65
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">a new solution something that fits in</font>

66
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,849
the middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this or we have actual</font>

67
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,709
vetted solutions from operator forums

68
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:51,500
that have regional best<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

69
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,720
operational practices and some means of

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,519
which to get things that are vetted as a

71
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,989
global best current operational practice

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:03,280
into a global of globally available

73
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:07,129
repository so we took an attempt at at a

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,519
something like a bc o P global

75
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:12,470
repository it started out with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

76
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,900
people that identified this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gap and we</font>

77
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,489
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great deal of dialogue on to how</font>

78
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,739
to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and brought it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a bunch of</font>

79
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">different rir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and operator forms and</font>

80
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,209
certainly we every time we walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

81
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:25,700
room and said would you be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in support of</font>

82
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,650
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this for the global</font>

83
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet and everybody in the room</font>

84
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,000
raises her hands and goes yes you know

85
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,430
that's that looks good you know you

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,930
should go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that which is</font>

87
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">always great right everybody wants to</font>

88
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,470
meet but doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to solve</font>

89
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,989
the problem we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of volunteers</font>

90
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:47,090
for building this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a solution</font>

91
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:50,120
across lots of different regions and and

92
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,150
we took some action so we had several

93
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings like this in in both this</font>

94
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,310
region and in others to develop a

95
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,339
process by which we could develop best

96
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">current operational practice documents</font>

97
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,459
it has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily nano eccentric in</font>

98
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,560
other words the track has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily</font>

99
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,910
held at nano of meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that we've</font>

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,250
held some other smaller regional

101
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,870
meetings all over the world not really

102
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,190
in an organized fashion kind of just the

103
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,810
volunteers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were available at the</font>

104
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,948
given regional meeting would would give

105
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,459
this a shot and check it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

local<font color="#CCCCCC"> community we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that other</font>

107
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,640
regions have used some other

methodologies whether it's you know

109
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,430
their methodology for managing documents

110
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,880
as a whole

111
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:32,630
or their idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of bc o peor</font>

114
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,699
dragged along it hasn't hasn't really

115
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,620

without a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pushing towards</font>

118
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,479
something that should be you know good

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,830
for the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that greeted</font>

121
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,780
that really taken off yet and and while

122
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,729
we were working through this this

123
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">regional process we identified another</font>

124
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,570
gap which is that you know it doesn't

125
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily make sense for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

126
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,300
one single dcop repository in that

127
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,190
things are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different in different</font>

128
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,270
regions and there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

129
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:14,050
should be global a bit like<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Chris was</font>

130
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,430
referring to<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the teaser the RIR</font>

131
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,560
methodology for identifying that

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is global as the same text and</font>

133
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,940
has adopted in all of the respective

134
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,849
regional internet registries so we've

135
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:29,659
explored various ideas for allowing for

136
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:31,490
a global solution these by the way are

137
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:32,659
the beat cops the date I just stuck this

138
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,310
in there so people could see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

139
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:36,740
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some progress we do have a bc o</font>

140
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,409
P development process that is mostly

working in the region we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:42,590
some documents and ratified a best

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,010
public peering exchange and there's a

146
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,979
current draft for ipv6 peering in

147
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:57,139
transit it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not the point of</font>

148
00:05:51,979 --> 00:06:00,320
this particular particular track so

149
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:04,190
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> read such a situation and and this</font>

150
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,169
track is about you know a take<font color="#CCCCCC"> two or an</font>

151
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,659
evolution of the idea behind best

152
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:09,770
current operational practices so I've

153
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,680
had a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different discussions about</font>

154
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:16,789
how to scale this and what it would need

155
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,259
sported we you know made a put in a vid

156
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,780
deal of effort into<font color="#E5E5E5"> defining the goals</font>

157
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:25,009
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was open transparent</font>

158
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:27,469
bottoms up both regional and global have

159
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,699
the documents state currents<font color="#CCCCCC"> ongoing</font>

160
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:33,440
updates and that it was

161
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:37,180
multi-stakeholder and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind</font>

162
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,990
this particular track was to make a

163
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,210
template or<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

164
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,390
the nanog regional track as an example

165
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,250
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide a package to send to other</font>

166
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,870
operator forums<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether they want to use</font>

167
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,330
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not is entirely up to them right</font>

168
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,370
but but we wanted to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example</font>

169
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,650
somewhere done that would make it easier

170
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:58,130
for other operators other operator

171
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,349
forums to get involved we created a

172
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:04,210
draft for both a global process and a

173
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,500
regional process for bc o P participants

174
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,969
we knew we needed some funds and some

175
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,270
staffs and resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually execute</font>

176
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,680
the above so it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just volunteers</font>

177
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,780
you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dragging it along but</font>

178
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,670
rather you know an organization that

179
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,520
really supported it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> unhelpful</font>

180
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">awareness and we needed to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

181
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,159
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a neutral party so it</font>

182
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,170
wasn't one particular region or one

183
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,750
particular operator or a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> rir</font>

184
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:30,290
but a neutral global organization to

185
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,750
support us so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is fairly simple</font>

186
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,430
right and it's slide by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

187
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,630
used an image that it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> RI our names</font>

188
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,510
but this is really meant to represent

189
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,040
all of the operator forums that are all

190
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the planet and there are so many of</font>

191
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">them there was no way I could stick them</font>

192
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,820
on a slide the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you have</font>

193
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,789
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own regional DCOP development</font>

194
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,290
process your own regional bc o P

195
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:54,100
repositories and the ability to work

196
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:57,710
with all the other to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross pollinate</font>

197
00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:02,120
these bc<font color="#E5E5E5"> o peas or make them global bc</font>

198
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,739
op's so in in searching around you know

199
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,080
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lots of similar things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

200
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">listed a few here so for example right</font>

201
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,450
501 or 554 in the right region is a are

202
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,560
examples of some documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

203
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,000
meant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current operational</font>

204
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,640
practices there is the IETF<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs which</font>

205
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,530
are not entirely operationally focused

206
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,020
but they're good examples of how a

207
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,239
global repository would be done for<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs</font>

208
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,370
there are individual repositories not

209
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,050
very well published but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist and</font>

210
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,750
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's your good old friend</font>

211
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,750
the your favorite qualified search

212
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:39,679
engine so what's happened in the last

213
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,200
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months well the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">been but helping volunteer for running</font>

215
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,000
the bc o P group asked I stock the

216
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:50,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet society</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for help facilitating</font>

218
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,820
the supporting staff

219
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,790
and they agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help the bc o P group</font>

220
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:01,040
asked the local nan on board and program

221
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,410
committee to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help facilitate this region</font>

222
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,390
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog was more than willing to help</font>

223
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,100
facilitate<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in this region as you</font>

224
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,420
can see by this track and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has been</font>

225
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:14,000
historically and the beat cop drafted a

226
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,800
new development process to accommodate

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,510
that so it's it's a work in progress and

228
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,310
is meant to be open and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottoms up and</font>

229
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,650
transparent<font color="#CCCCCC"> community driven so it is</font>

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,280
you know up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to help continue to</font>

231
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,689
modify that and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the lists and</font>

232
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,150
facilitating stuff had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> living on</font>

234
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:35,660
house so we created a list some new list

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,460
one is bc o P at<font color="#E5E5E5"> nana org and then</font>

dash subscribe at those lists which nano

has accommodated and we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

242
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,800
creating some global lists for a few

probably a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce list as that</font>

work what I'm responsible in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the team</font>

324
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:01,450
for is to facilitate operator to

325
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:03,520
operator communication in order to

326
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,400
capture the best current operational

327
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,790
practice out of deployment that people

328
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,420
did so the lessons learned how it should

329
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">be fixed the solutions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that were found</font>

330
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,969
in order to to

00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:21,980
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and also I know it's a bit</font>

332
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:26,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">in it's a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too tough of a mission but</font>

333
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:29,959
operator to the ITF ITF needs the

334
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:33,290
improved feedback from the operators

335
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,508
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually useful and what is</font>

336
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,839
wrong in the standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app they are</font>

337
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:41,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">producing we saw the the opportunity for</font>

338
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">increased operator feedback but I will</font>

339
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:50,239
talk about that in in a glance these two

340
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:52,369
processes are related but we are

341
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:55,220
approaching them as a two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

342
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:59,929
separate processes that in my personal

343
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:05,359
opinion can be addressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> as with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

344
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:09,949
same tools and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the challenge</font>

345
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:12,350
well when I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin slides I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

346
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:14,479
we we will be brothers onstage we will

347
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,569
be saying the same things basically so

348
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,999
we separately came to the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

349
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:26,089
definition there is there is no easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

350
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:29,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to find the operational practice</font>

351
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:33,379
document and be sure that it's valid

352
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:35,868
accurate and true right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

353
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:37,459
spread all over the community than

354
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:40,100
verbal conversation in the hallways

355
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:42,949
there are presentations that are

356
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,939
recorded<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not in rep region we make</font>

357
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:48,559
sure we record all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions oh yay</font>

358
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:51,559
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> email lists we have web forum</font>

359
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:58,009
threads so the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is scattered</font>

360
00:16:51,559 --> 00:17:04,069
around also there is a clutter in the IT

361
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:09,380
landscape so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no reliable way of</font>

362
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:14,089
finding these these documents the

363
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,500
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status is that also not many</font>

364
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:20,658
written documents are shared with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

365
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:22,519
community why because lots of

366
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:27,580
enterprises and big companies that

367
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:29,140
deploy ipv6 or any new technology

368
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,540
if they're at their own opinion on

369
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,380
sharing with the community they think of

370
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,510
this like like private secret super

371
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,980
hidden information and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

372
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:45,250
ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help their competitor to fix</font>

373
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,500
the problems in an easy way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a certain</font>

374
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,190
degree I could understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but we</font>

375
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,070
need to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around that so the</font>

376
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:59,640
solution idea is that we believe an

377
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:01,750
organized global repository would be

378
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,840
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution to this problem</font>

379
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,270
and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> facilitate the work and</font>

380
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">start the process inside the null</font>

381
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:12,639
communities around the world and

382
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,889
encourage them to start writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

383
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:23,010
documents this would simplify many many

384
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:25,360
things to search the information finding

385
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,900
and this was simplified network

386
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:33,000
deployments even for less traveled

387
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:37,180
operators make now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these documents</font>

388
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,590
should be or now must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> written by</font>

389
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:44,140
experienced operators and not by

390
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:48,600
philosophers wizards and I don't know

391
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:51,730
who will never touched a UTP patch cable

392
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,219
this should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be written by people that</font>

393
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,550
actually got<font color="#CCCCCC"> their got their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hands dirty</font>

are using these things in the production

get something that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense right and</font>

we as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet society deployed 360</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that will run this process</font>

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,209
like like

406
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,190
it happened here in in your community

407
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first community that is well</font>

408
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:45,970
in front of everybody else and then step

409
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:50,230
back and take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the global</font>

410
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:54,760
repository now the second issue that we

411
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:57,760
have that we see is and it's not

412
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,070
directly related to pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think</font>

413
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,830
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we can fix both things with the</font>

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:07,960
same tools this is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF for if</font>

415
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,129
anyone in the room does not understand

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:15,520
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ITF is this is a standards making</font>

IDF everything that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using guys</font>

419
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:25,000
comes from the IIT effort most most of

420
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:29,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet Society is</font>

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,990
administrative home or the ITF and we

422
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,780
need to we need to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

423
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:40,960
take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the processes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

424
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:45,190
inside the ITF and try to help them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

425
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,650
improve these processes so we have

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:57,160
communication there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a myth that</font>

428
00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">operators does not participate in the</font>

429
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:07,990
ITF this myth is half true there are

430
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:13,900
operators in the ITF process they are

431
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:18,340
but usually the big ones and as we

432
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:21,970
learned these operators usually don't

433
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,820
have time to prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> well for what they</font>

434
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,820
came for<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ITF meeting and usually</font>

435
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,810
they are they are run over by other

436
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:33,580
people that are well prepared from from

437
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,879
research organizations from the vendors

438
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:41,050
from everybody else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually they are</font>

439
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:44,740
not hurt well even even if they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

440
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:51,850
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> some feedback they are not hurt</font>

441
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:53,770
in many cases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> us well common sense</font>

442
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">would say that standards could be better</font>

443
00:21:53,770 --> 00:22:00,910
designed and better built if the

444
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:04,540
operators would have some word in the

445
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:08,679
process or would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give the</font>

446
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:13,990
feedback and say what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with this</font>

447
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:16,059
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we understood that we</font>

448
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:22,809
identified this this problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to help right let me go into into</font>

450
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,928
this area of why operators are not

451
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:32,590
participating in the ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is usually</font>

452
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:35,370
two things lack of<font color="#CCCCCC"> manpower and because</font>

453
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:38,050
operator needs to be in there knocks

454
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:41,320
running their networks make sure the

455
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:44,020
whole things work operators are

456
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,389
participating in Knox and usually they

457
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,059
can't afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send the best people for</font>

458
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:53,290
one week three<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a year for right</font>

459
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:58,059
for a sorry for ITF meeting and also

460
00:22:53,290 --> 00:23:04,170
operators relies on vendors however you

461
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:06,730
might oppose this sentence it is true

462
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,030
operators relies on vendors operators

463
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:12,309
talk to their vendors sometimes believe

464
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:16,360
the glossy papers and the the road maps

465
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:19,080
but operators talk to vendors and tell

466
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:24,159
them what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need but vendors does not</font>

467
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:29,830
always rely the message to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ITF as it</font>

468
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:31,720
was accepted so there are hidden agendas

469
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,550
there is politics behind that there is

470
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matt there is money attached to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

471
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:39,100
would not like to go into into this

472
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,559
discussion why this is like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is but it</font>

473
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:49,178
is like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so these are the reasons</font>

474
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:51,370
that slows down the operators feedback

475
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:57,190
to the ITF

476
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:59,469
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of solution ideas if</font>

477
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mohammed will not go to the mountain the</font>

478
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:05,940
mountain must come to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mohammed this</font>

479
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:09,449
is an old old old saying that means

480
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:13,059
let's create a discussion group or a

481
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:16,680
discussion point or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group or a</font>

482
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:21,040
track or whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it</font>

483
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:23,440
inside air IRS on mog communities where

484
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,240
operators can actually communicate their

485
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:32,650
needs and ones from the standard

486
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:34,840
processes so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

487
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">create these discussion points or</font>

488
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,669
working groups like you were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

489
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:42,160
it in here in nano kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really</font>

490
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy that now we have a perfect exam</font>

491
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:48,910
example for the rest of the world how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

492
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:53,639
do it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could bring in the</font>

493
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:58,630
presentations from the operators that

494
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:03,730
would present their deployment of new

495
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:05,980
technologies and that would mean not

496
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,260
just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> off on the stage saying</font>

497
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,679
yeah we deployed it like this look at me

498
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:16,059
i'm i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best but that presentation</font>

499
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:19,000
would mean i'm here because i would like

500
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:21,639
to start a document on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best current</font>

501
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,429
operational practice and i'm searching

502
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:29,470
for help if anyone got the same

503
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:33,280
experiences as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did i'm inviting him to</font>

504
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:35,559
work together with me to start a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bc o P</font>

505
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,649
document and this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the default</font>

506
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:42,910
intent of the operator presentations in

507
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the working group like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that next thing</font>

508
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,920
in the same space would be updates from

509
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">iit of working group chairs and</font>

510
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:59,500
co-chairs on their work<font color="#CCCCCC"> done inside ITF</font>

511
00:25:52,770 --> 00:26:02,170
I've been to some ITF meetings and if

512
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,760
you as an operator that usually don't

513
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,720
have time to follow all the mailing list

514
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">and all the discussion</font>

515
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,090
inside working group go to the ITF

516
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:14,830
meeting and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear the update from</font>

517
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:17,559
draft 02 to draft 03 on one particular I

518
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:20,620
don't know internet-draft you would not

519
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:23,340
understand the word what's going on so

520
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,530
what what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking here for is to</font>

521
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:30,610
create a platform for interested people

522
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:32,980
from the ITF that would come to knock

523
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:36,280
meetings and in five or ten minutes

524
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:38,070
present what they are doing they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

525
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,870
there working groups like I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

526
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:43,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">homeland</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> McDonnell's Lee comes to your</font>

527
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,309
meeting and uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5-10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes to say</font>

528
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,908
look we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are working on this and this and</font>

529
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:52,299
these issues right and then probably

530
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:54,039
somebody in in the room would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I</font>

531
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:56,620
did not know you're working on that I

532
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,600
need it exactly that where can I get

533
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,418
engaged where who do i contact where I

534
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:06,428
send an email and this is how this is

535
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:08,620
how the discussion starts we are also

536
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,900
looking for presentation from internal

537
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,418
draft orders that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

538
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:16,750
interested in evaluating their idea in

539
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:19,510
the community again the requirement is

540
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,710
to put the whole idea from start to

541
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,220
finish in five or ten minutes

542
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:28,320
presentation and actually explain what

543
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're working on and maybe somebody in</font>

544
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,559
somebody in the audience would say oh

545
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,409
this is exactly what I needed but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

546
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,928
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to work on</font>

547
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:40,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit different way so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

548
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:43,299
establish the communication between

549
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:48,700
standards and you guys the operators

550
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:50,500
that run the world right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

551
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be tough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so presentations from</font>

552
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,090
vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> noncommercial why presentation</font>

553
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,130
from vendors I hate commercial

554
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:02,439
presentations i can tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm an</font>

555
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:04,480
operator but during the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

556
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,750
with some people from some vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

557
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,630
found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is certain level of</font>

558
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:13,330
frustration because they would like to

559
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">standardize things but then when they</font>

560
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,870
get like 10 operators in the room there

561
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">are 10 different operators that run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

562
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:22,580
different networks slightly different

563
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,890
and there are 10 different requirements

564
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:29,179
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to standardize so there is no</font>

565
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:31,460
lowest common denominator agreed so here

566
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the idea that also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendors</font>

567
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:39,280
present their frustrations and try to

568
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:43,309
understand from the nog community on on

569
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,050
what stuff they should what what would

570
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:47,170
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lowest common denominator on</font>

571
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:50,960

focused groups together to have this

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:32,230
yet and we can open the mic for the

586
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,070
you were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about motivations why</font>

587
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,200
operators don't participate or often

588
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:50,520
don't participate effectively at the

589
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF there's another component that that</font>

590
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,480
I as a comment as a frequent participant

591
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:56,159
at IETF run into which is I don't think

592
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,050
when I when I'm having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem with an</font>

593
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,120
implementation I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a</font>

594
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">speck problem or a protocol problem most</font>

595
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,629
of the time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a vendor</font>

596
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:06,270
problem and if the vendor comes back and

597
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,880
says no no it's working as designed it's

598
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,770
just designed poorly well then usually I

599
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,770
go beat on the vendor rather than go

600
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,780
beat on the ietf and so I can see some

601
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,750
benefit here to short circuiting it but

602
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,460
it requires a mindset change in in the

603
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,190
operator the potential operator

604
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,630
participants to say as I'm implementing

605
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,570
something if I'm frustrated with

606
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,820
something think about how I would fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

607
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,889
if I were fixing a problem not just how

608
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,540
do I get around the problem that I'm

609
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,700
having with this particular

610
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,649
implementation and that's not

611
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily the you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as an operator</font>

612
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,440
not necessarily the mindset that I want

613
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have I just want to get the thing</font>

614
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:47,370
working because I've got more work to do

615
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:51,060
completely four different comment as a

616
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:53,310
working group chair of the ipv6 renumber

617
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,960
a working group I'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> delighted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

618
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,840
and talk well we're sort of winding down

619
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,940
but I'd be delighted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and talk to</font>

620
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,889
this organization this group about the

621
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,570
work that we have done get the operator

622
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,300
feedback it's very operations focused

623
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,669
working group and while I might be able

624
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come to every nanog and present I</font>

625
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:13,470
probably can't go to every regional nog

626
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,669
and present and I'm guessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

627
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,440
probably are not asking for a commitment

628
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,920
from all working group chairs to attend

629
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,210
five regional operator forums of course

630
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,220
there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know remote participation</font>

631
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,600
opportunities and of course they're

632
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,460
definitely hasn't as an internet draft

633

646
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:07,740
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're willing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you travel</font>

people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world will travel</font>

649
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,280
the working group chairs will travel to

650
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,410
two other meetings so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know and there</font>

651
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,990
should be also some exchange of

652
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,580
information or reports from from the

653
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,860
other similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> working groups around the</font>

654
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,220
world so they can exchange what was done

655
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:29,909
previously and so on and and to your

656
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:34,140
first comment you know being in your in

657
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:39,900
operation so long when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started as as a</font>

658
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:42,750
young invincible engineer I had no idea

659
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:47,490
that I can make a change that I can

660
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:50,340
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved in I ITF or air I</font>

661
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:53,910
our process and change anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

662
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,020
just rambling what they do what are they

663
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,460
smoking there when they were

664
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,740
standardizing it or what are they

665
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,540
smoking when they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

666
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,570
in air I are you know I had I had no

667
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:06,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea that I can make a difference and go</font>

668
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:09,389
there and take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a part in the process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

669
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:13,590
change something and I still think we

670
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:16,200
need to we need to tell the communities

671
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:18,389
to young people young engineers full of

672
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,910
energy that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make this</font>

673
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:23,640
difference thank you at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lewis from new</font>

674
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:25,500
star and for wireless we wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

675
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,780
smoking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff working the ITF</font>

676
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,160
writing specs and nowadays i'm on the

677
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,950
operator side where i'm wondering what I

678
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,809
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> smoking when I read the specs bad so</font>

679
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,550
I feel a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this pain just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drawn</font>

680
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:38,250
what you're saying but this really is a

681
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:40,500
big gap for being fact less now I gave a

682
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,480
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about DNS SEC how operators use it</font>

683
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,130
versus what the specs say and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did that</font>

684
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,679
passed over the past year so this really

685
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,970
means a lot I should talk to you

686
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,220
afterwards about some other things with

687
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,340
DNS very specific but I have a question

688
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,320
about this approach and the thing is

689
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:57,230
incentive for input is what I find is

690
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,939
always the hardest thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

691
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,950
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with other discussion</font>

692
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,960
areas other<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of</font>

693
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,610
world you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't always get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

694
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,559
amount of input and being like you do in

695
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">nanog and it's kind of harder in some</font>

696
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,279
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of people</font>

697
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it's people have things to say</font>

698
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,619
so whether or not they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to say it to</font>

699
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:17,509
this audience that audience is and then

700
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:19,099
how are you going to let<font color="#CCCCCC"> them say here's</font>

701
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,139
how we solve a problem without saying is

702
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:23,690
wrong but have others say that's a good

703
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:25,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically show that your birth</font>

704
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,409
best current means people vets to say

705
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:28,730
it's a good idea is but let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them just</font>

706
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:30,889
say what they want and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas will</font>

707
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,359
just get thrown away and some will keep

708
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:34,970
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and that's what's needed I</font>

709
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:36,619
think throwing on some of the ITF stuff

710
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,598
where whenever we tried to do a DNS

711
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:39,919
buyers guide type of thing it just got

712
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,950
laughed at we could never agree on

713
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,779
anything in DNS at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF venue that's</font>

714
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:51,379
part of part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my frustration is coming</font>

715
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">from so when I saw the the process</font>

716
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:59,960
proposal from Chris I immediately added

717
00:34:55,668 --> 00:35:03,828
the the idea of trying to encourage the

718
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,859
bcl<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pete authors to get at least some</font>

719
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:11,720
consensus and try to validate their work

720
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:13,490
in the community some things may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

721
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">validated because they need to go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

722
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,709
fast track or David or their urgent

723
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,649
matter that needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> published soon</font>

724
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:24,349
as possible some other things I think

725
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get the consensus and i think that</font>

726
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:28,099
the consensus in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community is the</font>

727
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:31,730
most important thing it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

728
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:33,710
fastest process possible but decisions

729
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:39,410
done on a consensus are the most solid

730
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:43,190
ones right so um and 44 BC<font color="#E5E5E5"> appeal to</font>

731
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:46,730
promote them to global level we thought

732
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some committee that would consist</font>

733
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:52,400
out of several<font color="#E5E5E5"> different regions from</font>

734
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:57,530
the working group that would evaluate

735
00:35:52,400 --> 00:36:00,500
and see which documents from the

736
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">region's can or should be promoted to</font>

737
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> global level I just to follow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

738
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:08,180
when I say when you say the word

739
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,589
consensus the BC or PS don't have to be

740
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,759
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only way to do something</font>

741
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:12,109
this could be this is a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

742
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,850
to do things you can have multiple of

743
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:14,900
them that are accepted

744
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,640
and sometimes they're very

745
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,350
domain-specific like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in north</font>

746
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,109
america i have certain regulations to

747
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:22,339
hear two and so on not somewhere else so

748
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,380
I'm just we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to have</font>

749
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete cohesive this is the cult this</font>

750
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,100
is the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think that's what</font>

751
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,300
tears down some of the process in other

752
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,580
places where they want to have one

753
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,140
unified way because that's part and

754
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,400
parcel of what they're after but this

755
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,900
case I mean there are many good ways to

756
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">do something it's worth saying here's</font>

757
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,610
here were four or five documents any one

758
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,440
of those they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different but they're</font>

759
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:46,100
all good ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is you</font>

760
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:49,910
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do yeah so just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be clear we</font>

761
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:52,190
are now in questioning mode I'm set for

762
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:56,120
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> half year to travel around the</font>

763
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:59,300
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> to different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dog meetings and to</font>

764
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:02,330
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to put together what the</font>

765
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:05,000
suggestions are for the process and how

766
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:09,080
to how to how to approach this issue

767
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,240
right so expect me<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like half a year</font>

768
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,610
coming back and saying look this is the

769
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,020
proposal this is what I heard around the

770
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:21,050
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we heard around the</font>

771
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:23,870
world and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay IGN</font>

772
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:27,470
jean-christophe from team Camryn to give

773
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:29,120
you some feedback perhaps for the one

774
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,819
side where you suggested why network

775
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,680
operators don't participate you didn't

776
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:37,360
list a point that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would make for</font>

777
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,859
myself as being an operator enough I've

778
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:43,300
worked with a few groups multicast

779
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:46,100
groups some dns some routing stuff and

780
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,410
part of the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find it</font>

781
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,870
difficult to participate more in the

782
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,910
IETF is that it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be actually quite</font>

783
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:57,259
discouraging when I do attempt to do

784
00:37:52,910 --> 00:38:01,160
that the process can be exceedingly too

785
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:03,950
lengthy watching for example one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

786
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:09,379
multicast pieces of work that had some

787
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:11,270
early input on just went to RFC maybe

788
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,740
like a year or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I when I saw</font>

789
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:16,400
come on like my name is on that for my

790
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:19,399
eight years ago forgot all about it for

791
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,930
respect to take so long it's just very

792
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,790
discouraging to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started on it to</font>

793
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">begin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with when you see that happen the</font>

794
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,020
other couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is when I've tried</font>

795
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,620
to contribute to specifications a few

796
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">times</font>

797
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:33,140
and it may be my own fall or maybe my

798
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:35,540
expectations weren't set is spending the

799
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,220
long time to comment on drafts and then

800
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,540
not even seeing like the grammatical

801
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,209
changes make it into the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

802
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,320
the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> is discouraging it's when</font>

803
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,650
that's happened to me three<font color="#E5E5E5"> or four</font>

804
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:49,720
times I I guess I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impression</font>

805
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:51,890
that some of the work being done maybe

806
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,810
not on the behalf of the community

807
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,890
sometimes but someone really has

808
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:57,020
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do for</font>

809
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves or for their organizations I</font>

810
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,350
want maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going a little too far I</font>

811
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,910
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Randy sometimes as a point when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

812
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:07,970
said when he calls it the IV TF yep

813
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:11,180
exactly and you know I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

814
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:13,609
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> also frustrating that that 44 RFC</font>

815
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:16,520
6-3 4-6 we need a two and a half years

816
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:19,910
to get it true right why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed two</font>

817
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:22,400
and a half years operators were at the

818
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:25,069
point when they were about<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide</font>

819
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,220
about the transition mechanism and they

820
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:30,650
were all deciding for CGN right and we

821
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,200
we wrote the alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the CG and</font>

822
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:36,140
the a plus B and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not published</font>

823
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,000
in a timely manner so now the cisco

824
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:42,650
picked it up and who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on map</font>

825
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:48,320
but it was a year and the process took a

826
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:52,190
year too long oh then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hearing</font>

827
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,990
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I what I hear here is that then we</font>

828
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to understand how to make how to</font>

829
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:59,270
change this process but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

830
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">changing I ltf profoundly are you</font>

831
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,990
committing to that

832
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:12,319
so your question is my committed to

833
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:15,079
helping change the process I don't know

834
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:18,259
maybe I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure that that process is</font>

835
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,700
the thing to change perhaps maybe part

836
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,109
of it is what may be like Aaron

837
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,759
suggesting is kind of a slightly

838
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,440
different approach to doing some of this

839
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,849
so a different group sort of gets

840
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,040
together what I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

841
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:30,710
perhaps would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be helpful and i'll be</font>

842
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,810
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to even attempt this myself is for</font>

843
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:35,359
someone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to nana</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aughh or ripe or</font>

844
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:38,180
apricot or wherever and say I'm do a

845
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,910
presentation to a talk that says here's

846
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:44,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the latest IETF stuff work maybe a</font>

847
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:47,210
sample of five important things the ipk

848
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,710
I stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> of BGP sack you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane in the</font>

849
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,290
DNS working group or whatever you know

850
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,970
the v6 ops kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just talk</font>

851
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,200
about it and and at least open that

852
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,029
dialogue here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that might be</font>

853
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,848
helpful I don't know that the process

854
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:01,430
itself not to encourage by changing that

855
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:03,920
to be quite frankly okay so we agree

856
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:07,399
that's exactly what was we proposed so

857
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:15,790
yeah this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you and other</font>

858
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:15,790
questions then thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

859
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:30,609
okay so this this really is on two

860
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:35,400
fronts right one is one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local</font>

861
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:38,940
regional<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCOP process and one is a</font>

862
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,460
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> by which regional</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DCOP</font>

863
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,290
organizations can help make things

864
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,480
globally available or create a global

865
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:49,900
standard to refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use give to other</font>

866
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,570
people whatever one thing that's that's

867
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,790
that's not entirely clear based on the

868
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,140
feedback so far as it does this sound

869
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,400
reasonable is this the right thing this

870
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:00,520
is supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

871
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,780
community-driven not you know if you

872
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,710
guys trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure this out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

873
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:08,740
side so it's really important that you

874
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:12,330
stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say this sucks sure this is</font>

875
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:14,529
great and and give some guidance as

876
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:17,650
volunteers as members of the community

877
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:20,320
or or participate and help out there's

878
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:25,450
certainly been a lot of discussion over

879
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:29,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years on on some small lists and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

880
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:32,740
going to move those<font color="#CCCCCC"> too nanog today</font>

881
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:35,080
actually for that discussion to continue

882
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,540
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love to hear you know if we're</font>

883
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,609
doing something wrong please<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand up</font>

884
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:42,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a suggestion for what the right</font>

885
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:46,830
way is or or say you know keep going

886
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,830
love some actual feedback for this

887
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,050
crickets

888
00:42:54,930 --> 00:43:01,700
awesome

889
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:05,058
how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> he spoke yes dated by rocky</font>

890
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,379
AT&T consulting just as a as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

891
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:09,740
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things I've heard so far is</font>

892
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:12,650
people talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing specs for</font>

893
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,240
new things<font color="#CCCCCC"> but my understanding is that</font>

894
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,309
we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the best current</font>

895
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,970
practices so we'd really be talking

896
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:21,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document Tim are we not</font>

897
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:25,578
talking about the documentation of

898
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:28,460
what's out there now so again this is

899
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:31,490
community so the original vision was was

900
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:34,609
you know the big picture how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we fix</font>

901
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:38,209
the global<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet right how do we make</font>

902
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:39,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy for anybody who needs</font>

903
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,950
information on an operational best

904
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,650
practice to find it now that might be

905
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:47,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">really common things like how do we</font>

00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,480
implement i Gress egress filters update

908
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,500
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sort of standard set of</font>

909
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:56,569
operational guidelines to say here's an

00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,279
8020 model and a place that you can go

911

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitive reference on how to and</font>

912
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:07,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that's current and common</font>

913
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:10,250
falls into that area whether that's

914
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:13,730
whether that's regional or global is a

915
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:15,319
whole different issue right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

916
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">think if you made it if you ask for a</font>

917
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:21,470
call for volunteers to write up the the

918
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:24,920
how to's you could probably get a get a

919
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:27,109
decent<font color="#CCCCCC"> getid get a decent pool of</font>

920
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,930
volunteers who would do that as opposed

921
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:34,339
to the new the newest more cutting-edge

922
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:36,319
stuff absolutely so um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a call</font>

923
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:38,630
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well right there are several</font>

924
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,609
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> areas of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interest or one is</font>

925
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,930
fine subject matter experts who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

926
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:43,880
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to write</font>

927
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:46,009
documents and share them right there's

928
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,470
another set that is find people that are

929
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:50,480
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you know this does or</font>

930
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,890
doesn't fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that 80 20 mile right to</font>

931
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,390
actually vet the document so you don't

932
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:56,538
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have somebody writing something on</font>

933
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:59,270
going here you go this is definitive and

934
00:44:56,539 --> 00:45:01,579
done and embedded move forward you know

935
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are other aspects of it</font>

936
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:06,640
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are how do we facilitate a best</font>

937
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,029
current operational practices

938
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,730
development process

939
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:14,650
regionally and who is interested in

940
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:16,300
helping define a best current

941
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,790
operational practices development

942
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,550
process globally and one of those two

943
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:23,800
things look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so yes this is a call</font>

944
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:26,680
for volunteers if you are willing to

945
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">write documents absolutely fantastic if</font>

946
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,730
you're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go find people outside</font>

947
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,259
of these organizational areas that you

948
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,940
believe are subject matter experts and

949
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,170
could help the world get a little

950
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,320
cleaner a little better make the

951
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:39,910
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice great thank you very much</font>

952
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,190
please drag them in sign them up to the

953
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,990
list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them to write something if</font>

954
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,150
you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the way we're</font>

955
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:48,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this change the format think we're</font>

956

959
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,480
this is the finest thing you could do

960
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,619
for volunteer service for the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

961
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">the global</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet and your community</font>

962
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:10,900
is take some time and spend it here in

963
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:12,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">my opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Thank You Lea Lea mmm Lee</font>

964
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,650
Howard again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you pretty much</font>

965
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:16,240
answered what I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say because</font>

966
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,260
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing two different sets of</font>

967
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,919
activities and there was a question

968
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how do we motivate participation</font>

969
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,390
and it sounds like for some set of

970
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">people once there's a document once</font>

971
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:30,069
there's a draft document getting people

972
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to read it especially if they know</font>

973
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:33,850
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a discussion at a</font>

974
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:36,840
meeting getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to read it well</font>

975
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:40,630
we have mixed results at the IETF but

976
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,710
some people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to the IETF so but</font>

977
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:44,200
no way that there's here's the agenda

978
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:46,210
these documents will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussed we'll</font>

979
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,569
discuss a certain document completely

980
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:52,810
different than say an errand public

981
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:55,330
policy this consultation which is

982
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,890
because anybody have any ideas they

983
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,259
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort</font>

984
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:00,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">of shoot some you know float some things</font>

985
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,500
and see what's gets shot down and what

986
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,420
gets brought up which would wear new

987
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,270
stuff might come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

988
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:09,910
it may be easier and I'm sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of asking</font>

989
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:11,290
you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also asking here so there's a</font>

990
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,339
difference between commenting and

991
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,259
contributing to an existing document

992
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:17,830
which can be done in a meeting kind of

993
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:20,440
forum or on a mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> and batting</font>

994
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,430
ideas around which is much better suited

995
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,869
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation in a four</font>

996
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,359
like this are we talking about the same

997
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:28,160
things yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you know this this</font>

998
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:30,440
is the challenge with with bums up open

999
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,089
community rate is is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you have</font>

1000
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,700
to start somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> so starting on</font>

1001
00:47:32,089 --> 00:47:36,109

1004
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:43,369
until something's broken just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much as</font>

1005
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,660
if I wanted a document written written

1006
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:46,309
on something I'll have to do is write

1007
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,529
one that's entirely wrong and presented

1008
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:49,819
as being right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have 300 people</font>

1009

are a good place to start right you

1014
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:03,890
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discussed list and if that</font>

1015
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,210
turns into individual working groups

1016
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,799
that gets pulled out or particular

1017
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,770
subject matter expert areas that gets

1018

needing drafting or starting or

1023

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want to create one my</font>

thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> was so my thought was that gee</font>

1025
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:32,328
there's this mailing list that I've

1030
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:46,339
week somebody says how do I something

00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:48,650
and if there's any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of discussion at</font>

1033
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,990
obvious that it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be the wrong</font>

1034
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,630
venue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the perfect topic to</font>

1035
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:58,459
just slap up on a page someplace saying

1036
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:00,400
documents needing drafting and then

1037
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:03,290
somebody can jump in and start using

1038
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,869
scribed or a wiki or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the</font>

1039
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:08,089
appropriate tool is or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font>

1040
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:10,700
because you know XML to RFC is such an

1041
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:12,890
easy tool to use and start making<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from this room assuming</font>

walking out of the room going what the

heck<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they talking about you know</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists to facilitate those kind of</font>

1054
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,250
things we've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> started with the</font>

1055
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:45,589
request for a discuss in and announced

1056
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:51,310
but it's it's up to the members of this

1057
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:54,110
community yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you Lee</font>

1058
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:57,710
something triggered<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thought in me</font>

1059
00:49:54,110 --> 00:50:00,440
but what you said I remember the

1060
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:04,000
exercise in a ripe community how to get

1061
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:07,700
people involved with right 50 1554 right

1062
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,930
with 501 we got reasonable amount of

1063
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:13,520
feedback a few people got engaged but it

1064
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,200
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in the community okay</font>

1065
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,780
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time you comment if you</font>

1066
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,109
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you don't comment you</font>

1067
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:23,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get some cycles maybe not right if</font>

1068
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:25,040
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> too long then you say okay I'll</font>

1069
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:28,850
read it later and you never read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1070
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,430
again and we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> after a year and a</font>

1071
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,290
half to a reasonable consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> but well</font>

1072
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:35,120
very strong consensus in the community

1073
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:38,720
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to publish something else</font>

1074
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,160
this was an ongoing<font color="#CCCCCC"> live document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

1075
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:45,069
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish something and not</font>

1076
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:48,410
babysit it forever however this document

1077
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:50,210
was so when spread around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was translated into more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

languages right all around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

1080
00:50:52,330 --> 00:51:01,130
governments enterprises started using it

1081
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:03,530
and it got legs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden when</font>

1082
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,860
we started the replacement document that

00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">was later known as Phi Phi for all of a</font>

1084
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,440
sudden huge amount of people wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1085
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:14,660
comment it and they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">engaged just to put their name on the</font>

1087
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:20,270
acknowledgement section right have a

1088
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:22,690
look in in 255<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that is in acknowledgement section and</font>

1090
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:28,340
you know if you produce the first

1091
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:31,009
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a document let get some sort</font>

00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">of consensus and becomes successful and</font>

1093
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:39,040
used you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then improve it and the</font>

1094

community will be

1095
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:54,010
will be interested in these specially

1096
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:58,930
vendors in my case<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so other</font>

1097
00:51:54,010 --> 00:52:01,810
comments questions before moving on<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1098
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:05,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to ask Chris</font>

1099
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:08,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">Grundmann presents a suggested draft for</font>

a regional<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cop development process</font>

1101
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:17,530
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of feedback we've gotten from</font>

1102
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:19,450
people on list and this is to comment on

1103
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:23,080
how you'd like to drive the local

1104
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:24,910
process so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when you speak up you</font>

1105
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,620
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is either things get done are</font>

1106
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:29,589
things don't but nothing gets done

1107
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:32,230
without community support so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1108
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:33,790
when you stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yell at Chris or</font>

1109
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:37,630
the room and say your writer you're

1110
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:43,150
wrong and we're participating or not and

1111
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:44,440
with that Chris thanks aaron yan yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1112
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:46,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">i said i think what we've talked about a</font>

1113
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,550
little bit here<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is this kind of it</font>

1114
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:50,560
in my view anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three three</font>

1115
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:53,890
pieces what we're talking about here one

1116
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:55,720
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the regional process for</font>

1117
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,620
creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> VCO piece and in documenting</font>

1118
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,850
them and putting them in some place

1119
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,650
where people can actually find them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1120
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,810
then another one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that at a</font>

1121
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:03,310
global level and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third one is</font>

1122
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:05,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">using that as operational feedback back</font>

1123
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:09,640
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> forums like the ITF and so this is</font>

1124
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific to a nanog focused regional bc</font>

1125
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:16,750
o P working group and how we will

1126
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:19,630
develop those beasts<font color="#E5E5E5"> eops and this again</font>

1127
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:24,040
this is a first draft it's based on

1128
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:26,290
quite a bit of other work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

1129
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we've tagged it for now is is the</font>

1130
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:34,270
nanog dcop development process and and

1131
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:38,470
again the idea here is to bring forth

1132
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:40,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">right suss out all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this useful</font>

1133
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:42,669
network engineering knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> is out</font>

1134
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:46,090
there and put it up in one place where

1135
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:47,290
it can actually be found and the

1136
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,690
document itself the development process

1137
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,070
itself borrows heavily from the Aaron

1138
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:52,930
policy develop processes that's

1139
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:54,160
something that seems to work fairly

1140
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">with community input and community</font>

1141
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,490
feedback as an ongoing process for

1142
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:01,329
keeping the living document current and

1143
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:03,520
working previous to this is aaron said

1144
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:06,069
this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been going on for a number of</font>

1145
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,140
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> create a development</font>

1146
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:11,349
process that this is now being basically

1147
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:14,618
a revised<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of that and the way</font>

1148
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:15,490
it's structured is in two pieces so

1149
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,710
there's a development process

1150
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:21,308
fundamentals kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1151
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:23,770
a nanog<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcf/d working group kind of a</font>

1152
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:28,180
common set of ideals and goals and then

1153
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:30,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual process itself so in the</font>

1154
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,078
current draft a document which again as

1155
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:33,579
soon as we move everyone who is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1156
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,930
current mailing list over the new

1157
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:36,579
mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list will send this out and</font>

1158
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,529
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start beating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

1159
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:40,030
directly in the actual text but I want

1160
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,740
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> run through kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the highlights</font>

1161
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:43,809
here of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've contained and and</font>

1162
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,939
again as Aaron said this is at any point

1163
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:47,440
here feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to jump up if there's</font>

1164
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:49,780
anything on on any of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> sections</font>

1165
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,190
that seems like it's out of line<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1166
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,720
doesn't mesh with what we've talked

1167
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,910
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here today or what you your vision</font>

1168
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,149
of this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be now is a great time to</font>

1169
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:59,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">start that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation so the purpose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1170
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,079
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about quite a bit so if</font>

1171
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">we dig into the philosophy one of the</font>

1172
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,349
first things is being free from

1173
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:07,030
organizational agendas so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

1174
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:09,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things here that there</font>

1175
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:12,309
may be some specific organizations who

1176
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:15,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">influence other organizations and we</font>

1177
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:17,470
want to be ensure that any<font color="#CCCCCC"> vco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peas that</font>

1178
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:20,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">are written reflect actual operational</font>

1179
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:21,848
reality and experiences alright so we're

1180
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:25,119
synthesizing the knowledge from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1181
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:26,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire community again overall for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1182
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,190
for the upper levels for the entire

1183
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:32,559
global network engineering community but

1184
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:36,460
more localized to the regional area as

1185
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:39,430
well I needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available to everyone</font>

1186
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:41,440
and it need to be communal knowledge and

1187
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:44,290
then of course one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goals of all</font>

1188
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,670
of this right why even do this is we

1189
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,440
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know creating this</font>

1190
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,910
knowledge or this repository of

1191
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,740
knowledge and allowing folks to find it

1192
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:52,390
easily as<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're building and operating</font>

1193
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,250
networks around the world will help

1194
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:56,890
advance the internet and push it out

1195
00:55:54,250 --> 00:56:01,030
further into more more areas and and

1196
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:02,618
have to run better in all those areas so

1197
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:04,869
what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the scope of such a</font>

1198
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:06,490
working group here within nanog again

1199
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:09,130
publicly available community regular

1200
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:10,660
documents synthesizing the knowledge of

1201
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">real world network engineering best</font>

1202
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:17,170
practices<font color="#E5E5E5"> ongoing living documents that</font>

1203
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:19,930
are scrutinized and revised over time

1204
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:22,660
and and to get an earlier point as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

1205
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:24,310
these would not be rules by any stretch

1206
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,509
of the imagination right these are

1207
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,369
intended to provide good advice about

1208
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,690
operational practices call out

1209
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:35,200
exceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they're notable and</font>

1210
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:37,869
move on I think they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be based on</font>

1211
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,490
on for general principles the<font color="#E5E5E5"> openness</font>

00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:40,810
transparency<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom-up and ongoing the</font>

1213
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:43,390
same principles that everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else in</font>

1214
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:44,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is based on I can feel it</font>

1215
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:47,980
all very straightforward<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the ones</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that were added</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin's slides were</font>

consensus-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeds into both of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

1219
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:59,890
as well the last part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1220
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:02,200
fundamentals section really is is a

1221
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:05,230
criteria for publishing of EcoP which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1222
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:07,629
think need to be fairly strict but

1223
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,160
there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot there really we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1224
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:11,080
clear and technically sound documents

1225
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,879
and the way to judge if their kinetic

1226
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,840
and technically sound is through

1227
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,210
consensus through the community

1228
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,950
discussion and people agreeing that yes

1229
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,869
that's really a good way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and</font>

1230
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:22,149
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously being developed this open</font>

1231
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:24,100
transparent process so that it's capable

1232
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,630
for people to jump in and say yes or no

1233
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that's a good idea that's a bad</font>

1234
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:31,330
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a horrible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of doing it or</font>

1235
00:57:27,369 --> 00:57:32,440
or that is the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do it we did</font>

1236
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a little bit into more than</font>

1237
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,820
nitty-gritty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process here we're</font>

1238
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,780
introducing some new terms there's a

1239
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,580
concept here of a steering committee

1240
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,040
right some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of organization a group</font>

1241
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:44,799
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people appointed by the community</font>

1242
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,930
some form that will be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1243
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,609
gatekeepers of what is a published PCO p

1244
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,720
and what shouldn't be published but

1245
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:51,970
there need to be somebody who judges if

1246
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,109
that consensus exists or not obviously

1247
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,790
subject matter experts are the ones we

1248
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:55,990
weren't writing these documents and each

1249
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,850
documents going to need a shepherd

1250
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:59,259
because if you have a small group small

1251
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:00,730
steering committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of the</font>

1252
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,380
gating factor they're obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1253
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:04,240
going to be able to keep track<font color="#CCCCCC"> of every</font>

1254
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,320
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> document if this is successful if</font>

1255
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,509
we have a lot of documents being

1256
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,890
produced<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially at first we'll need</font>

1257
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,570
each document type its own Shepherd

1258
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,490
which may or may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a subject matter</font>

1259
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:16,510
expert or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a member</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the steering</font>

1260
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:17,890
committee so with that kind of as that

1261
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,230
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> foundation in the background of</font>

1262
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:20,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">an ANA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acop working group what is the</font>

1263
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,780
process

1264
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,980
and look like right so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think then</font>

1265
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,980
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of this has brought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1266
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:30,080
ongoing this is just our idea being put

1267
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,270
forth and we really want feedback into

1268
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,290
this process because obviously building

1269
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,150
the development process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1270
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:37,850
the keystone of how this moves forward

1271
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:40,610
going into the future so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1272
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:42,920
start with an appeal move to a draft bc

1273
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:43,910
o P a candidate<font color="#E5E5E5"> bc o P published the vco</font>

1274
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:48,020
p and then obviously there needs be an

1275
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:50,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">update process so what's an appeal an</font>

1276
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:53,300
appeal is basically a question right how

1277
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,700
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do this at least example from the</font>

1278
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,550
mailing list i think is a great a great

1279
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">one because as I've started working over</font>

1280
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:01,460
the last several years with Aaron and

1281
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:03,620
others on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pc o P process I've</font>

1282
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,570
noticed those emails and now they always

1283
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:07,490
stick out to me and then within the

1284
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,720
nanog forum or other forums there's a

1285
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,459
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on where someone says</font>

1286
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,040
hey how do I do this and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens to</font>

1287
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,990
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually a handful or half a dozen or</font>

1288
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,640
even more people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who know how to do it</font>

1289
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:17,959
but it's not written they don't they

1290
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,589
don't just usually provide a link they

1291
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,720
explained it every single time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1292
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:25,070
when that question gets asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked the</font>

1293
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,299
idea then is to collect those into this

1294
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:30,770
nanog regional<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCOP working group</font>

1295
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:33,890
collect those questions and then move

1296
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:35,390
them forward right so what they would be

1297
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:39,020
moved with forward to would be a draft

1298
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:40,549
bc o P so any any appeal any question

1299
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,710
this gets asked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community that</font>

1300
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,990
has significant community interest that

00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not overly broad or or</font>

1302
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:48,709
overly specific if it's too<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific the</font>

1303
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,000
documents not worth reading if it's

1304
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,290
overly broad where all the sudden trying

1305
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,660
to document how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet works which</font>

1306
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:55,220

00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,890
relevant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community needs to be</font>

1309
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:02,509
someone willing to take this on and

1310
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:05,210
Shepherd it through the process if an

1311
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:06,440
appeal meets those criteria the steering

1312
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:08,210
committee would then selected as a draft

<font color="#E5E5E5">PCO p the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shepherd would go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1314

recruit subject matter experts to help

01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:19,130
then discuss it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right on the mailing</font>

1318
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:21,379
list may bring it to meetings keep the

discussion going until you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

1320
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,800
some consensus starts to coalesce around

01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:27,080
yes these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are good answers this is a</font>

1322
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:31,070
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of doing it which is when we</font>

judges<font color="#E5E5E5"> this based on community feedback</font>

from the discussion phase into the you

to add their exception or helped draft

and then you know just follow a regular

process of posting text a couple of

meetings as a gating factor for those

documents moving forward which we then

1353

bring it to being<font color="#E5E5E5"> published so again</font>

1354
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:36,919
rough consensus on the mailing list and

1355
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,650
within the meeting with no set of no

1356
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,620
major objections no reasonable outraged

1357
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:44,480
at the answers wrong and then again to

1358
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,350
the two-week text freeze before a

1359
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,950
meeting talk about it at the meeting

1360
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:51,770
two-week last call and again those

1361
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:54,169
durations are just placeholders for now

1362
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,280
whatever makes sense and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

1363
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:57,080
publish it somewhere where everyone can

1364
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,790
find it in a place where it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1365
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,200
searchable right so you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1366
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:01,850
surgeons be able to find it but you also

1367
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,379
want an easy URL where everyone you can

1368
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,880
point people to it and say this is where

1369
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:08,480
you go to find operational information

1370
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,860
within our region and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then of course the</font>

1371
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,980
final phase would be to cycle this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1372
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:15,850
back when you know technology changes

1373
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,870
when an operator finds a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

1374
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:20,420
whatever the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be obviously these</font>

1375
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:21,380
are intended to be living documents that

1376
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,380
are going to be changed in an ongoing

1377
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:25,940
basis and so an appeal will then also be

1378
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:28,100
submitted to say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a problem</font>

1379
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:30,010
with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing vc o P and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1380
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,970
fix it or perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can retire it</font>

1381
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:33,710
they'll just follow through the exact

1382
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">same process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most part and</font>

1383
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:39,530
update will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slightly different</font>

1384
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:42,169
that's it so so that is what we've

1385
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:43,610
outlined is kind of a draft development

1386
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:46,970
process for<font color="#CCCCCC"> BC Opie's in the Niagara</font>

1387
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:47,990
region and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is for folks to</font>

1388
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:50,540
review it

1389
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:57,470
and provide feedback starting here and

1390
01:02:50,540 --> 01:03:02,110
yes we mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so the need comments</font>

1391
01:02:57,470 --> 01:03:02,109
questions rotten fruit in your briefcase

1392
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:10,440
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve Hall level three on this is</font>

1393
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:13,050
just so a bit of museum because I'm

1394
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,940
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> an analogy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of the metal</font>

community and some of the PubMed drafts

01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:23,310
and some of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll call</font>

1398
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:25,560
consensus ideas and sometimes you know

1399
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:28,279
the there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a let's say a</font>

1400
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:30,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">monolithic answer that comes out as a</font>

1401
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:33,450
result let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of internal</font>

1402
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,589
debate when internally or behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1403
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:38,029
scenes there still might be a lot of

01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:41,250
contentious to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate or</font>

1405
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:44,400
differentiations about what is the

1406
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:46,260
actual answer you know the best answer

1407
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you just have those different</font>

1408
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:52,800
factions spinning off so one of my

1409
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:54,810
musings is maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of a not just a</font>

1410
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:58,400
consensus if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some type of</font>

1415
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,640
do some additional thinking and other

01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:13,710
the same well what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consensus I</font>

1417
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,990
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and see hey there were</font>

1418
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:19,740
actually one two three maybe four or

1419

five potential best practice solutions

1420
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:25,680
forward in this is just what happened to

01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think one one of the reasons why the</font>

1423
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,420
man listening to be public it needs to

1424
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,520
be archived is contained in that and

1425
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">then too I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think anything that is</font>

1426
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,570
contentious right if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

1427
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,820
single answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the desire here is a</font>

1428
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:41,460
documented so documented exceptions

1429
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:43,140
within the bc o P document itself is is

1430
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,970
extremely important and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1431
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">be part of the process so if we say okay</font>

1432
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:49,350
eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of time you can do this</font>

1433
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,850
or maybe it's split and you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

1434
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have two answers and then</font>

1435
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:53,580
there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> these major exceptions</font>

1436
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:55,200
where in this case you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this doesn't</font>

1437
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:58,670
work in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case doesn't work and try</font>

1438
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:01,350
and document to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best of our ability</font>

1439
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,060
that debate in kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> final form in</font>

1440
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,770
the document yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I was</font>

1441
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:07,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there might</font>

1442
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:10,350
be certain topics where one answer

1443
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,420
doesn't fit all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there may be cases</font>

1444
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:15,120
where doing something significantly

1445
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,860
different from what is the majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

1446
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,839
might actually work out for some group

1447
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,430
of people I'd hate for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go off</font>

1448
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wrong</font>

1449
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:23,990
way and we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other facets you</font>

1450
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:27,589
know again I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> used a medical field</font>

1451
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:29,450
as a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> example we're all there is as</font>

1452
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:31,730
of today even for things that we take

1453
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:33,529
for granted there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to be</font>

1454
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:35,750
groups of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying look no this is</font>

1455
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:40,609
it's this other thing and it's good for

1456
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:43,720
that debate to continue absolutely Lee

Howard I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming back again I</font>

1458
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,950
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word appeal as the way to</font>

1459
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,940
kick off the process appeal sounds to me

1460
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,109
like what you do at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1461
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:55,329

like I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer call or question or</font>

people for over a decade asking for

1473
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:35,160
these types of things I did work with

1474
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:37,649
Aaron for 13 years and I spoke to

1475
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:40,470
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people inside this region</font>

1476
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:43,530
and I had thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people over time</font>

1477
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:45,810
ask for exactly this what you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:48,900
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing right now they would</font>

1479

<font color="#CCCCCC">love to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from more experienced</font>

1484
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,270
I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the microphone to talk about</font>

1485
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:01,710
so I wanted what I wanted to do is I

1486
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:04,320
wanted to point back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

1487
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:06,540
things that that sally wentworth talked

1488
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,360
about earlier today and the increased

1489
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:12,480
interest that governments<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in what</font>

1490
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:13,770
operators do you know operators they

1491
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,550
really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want they have the</font>

1492
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:18,960
government come in and state what it is

1493
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:21,270
that they should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing how they</font>

1494
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,430
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be operating their networks but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1495
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:25,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone here would agree that in</font>

1496
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,029
the coming years it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become</font>

1497
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">more and more difficult to keep</font>

1498
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:32,790
governments outside of the fold they're

1499
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,350
going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say things they're</font>

1500
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:36,600
going to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perhaps mandate things</font>

1501
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:38,700
and become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in what</font>

1502
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,170
everyone in this room does and it may

1503
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,149
not happen in the North American region

1504
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:44,190
but it might happen somewhere else first

1505
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:46,190
there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come a time when a</font>

1506
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:48,270
government actually wants to mandate an

1507
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:51,540
operational practice inside its borders

1508
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:53,820
and I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pose that if that</font>

1509
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,770
were to happen I would much rather than

1510
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:59,280
point to something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in</font>

they get needed but at a minimum if you

point out something that's probably

obvious to everyone in the room all this

1550
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:15,179
process is only useful if we have you

know bc<font color="#CCCCCC"> o PS to send to other regions so</font>

I know I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron invited everyone to</font>

1553
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:24,360
take the time and and write something

01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:27,929
and certainly I I'm written anything

myself so I can't say anything but it's

important all this this work is wasted

if we don't have be cops<font color="#E5E5E5"> too or bc o PS</font>
