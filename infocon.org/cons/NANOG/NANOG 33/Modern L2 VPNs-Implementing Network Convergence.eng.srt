supported by the IP core network so to

38
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,320
accomplish this we came up with three

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,449
general requirements for the MPLS

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,199
and rather obvious is a stable IP core

42
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,790
we certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this on</font>

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,060
and definitely had confidence that we

55
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,510
to a provider edge with two links we

56
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:48,780
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull those the provider edges</font>

57

approach our second<font color="#E5E5E5"> general requirement</font>

84
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:10,049
was to maintain service separation on

the MPLS overlay and the IP core by

86

maintaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> service separation we were</font>

able to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network specific expertise</font>

intact so organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> already familiar</font>

with the l2vpn stuff and those with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,180
IP core didn't have to go through a

91
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,130
lengthy training process so that enabled

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,350
us to

93
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:33,469
get the service to market quicker the

94
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,480
caveat is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach there are</font>

95
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,220
others approach is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the organization</font>

96
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,510
of fault isolation and detection can

97
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:45,290
become more complex as you add overlay

98
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,810
networks to the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> core so coordinating</font>

99

maintenance windows and things like that

100
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,600
can can get tougher as this stuff gets

101
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:58,280
layered on so it's definitely important

102
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay ahead of that we felt the best</font>

103
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,460
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain the service separation</font>

104
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,920
was to achieve as much functional

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,320
separation as possible therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

106
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,170
third requirement was to have separate

<font color="#CCCCCC">igp functionality on the MPLS overlay</font>

108
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:15,500
and the IP core to meet this end we

109
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:20,180
employed GRE tunnels between the SC

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,310
nodes<font color="#CCCCCC"> / PPP links to the IP core using</font>

static routes for tunnel tail reach

112
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:29,960
ability we chose GRE based on

configuration simplicity<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

115
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,530
our vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> was able to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around GRE</font>

116
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:45,620
implementation very quickly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font>

get get it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so GRE met our</font>

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,200
requirements and it also allows the IP

119
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,120
core to continue to add other services

120
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,479
without changes being required on our

121
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,600
end pls overlay<font color="#CCCCCC"> network but there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font>

215
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,410
fully meshed tunnel construct and this

216
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,100
is indeed actually what we have out

217
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:16,819
there today we have three service edge

218
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,260
nodes tying into the IP core we we do

219
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,290
have more pops out there but those are

220
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:25,100
tied in<font color="#E5E5E5"> indirect links to the SC devices</font>

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:29,599
that are shown<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so we're going to</font>

222
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:31,070
full match we used /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30s you know the</font>

223
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,360
point-to-point links so that's obvious

224
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:39,140
we used RFC 1918 addresses for our

225
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,610
tunnel interfaces no need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to waste good</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">rest based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on stuff that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not routed</font>

227
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:50,359
these fully meshed tunnels then support

228
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,640
a full mesh of tunnel LSPs so here's a

229
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,580
logical view of the fully meshed LSP

230
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,189
construct again primary and backup /

231
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,710
tunnel and again two tunnels between

232
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,840
each service edge so we got a quite a

233
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:08,810
bit of diversity and redundancy built in

234
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:10,730
there and so in summary our l2vpn

235
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,699
service was successfully extended coast

236
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:18,740
to coast with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our tvs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> averaging</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy</font>

238
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,500

239
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:26,510
and we did it at minimal cost the

240
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,310
networks were already there we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

241
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,600
to purchase some interfaces for the IP

core

243
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,380
then bring up the links and in most

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases our service their devices are in</font>

245
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:44,240
the same pop as our provider edge

246
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:47,509
devices so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fiber run thus</font>

247
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,209
far as you saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in three nodes right</font>

248
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:52,009
so so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> we haven't experienced a</font>

249
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,819
significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> increase in operations</font>

250
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:57,649
complexity or scalability and

251
00:12:54,819 --> 00:13:00,079
scalability down the road is certainly a

252
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:02,120
concern but there's a lot more dro the

253
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,469
head of us and indeed there's there's

254
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,449
gonna be a lot more options<font color="#CCCCCC"> as new</font>

255
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:08,540
technologies emerge so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

256
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:11,719
meet those ends so so we'll see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

257
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:19,269
future brings and there are some

references that our interesting reading

259
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,500
and so if anyone has<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>
