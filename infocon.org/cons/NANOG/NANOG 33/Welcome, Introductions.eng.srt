great meeting a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good input a lot</font>

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,769
of stuff from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've heard last night</font>

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,559
transparency was an important theme and

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,129
I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> three main areas where we need to</font>

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,290
rethink what we've been doing there one

13
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,149
area is budget you'd like to know what

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,670
merits doing with your registration fees

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:49,020
and those numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,850
you soon the second area of transparency

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,770
was mailing list I do moderate the

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,300
mailing list I don't know if I've gotten

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,899
more transparent in the last couple of

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,500
months but I have eased up a lot and the

21
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,960
messages i sent since mid-november so

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,020
have all been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people using obvious</font>

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,939
pseudonyms or<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sometimes it's</font>

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,520
someone who is just forgetful like they

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,610
send in a message under network security

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,408
at their isp whereas we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,330
know who they are so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very</font>

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsive to those messages and add</font>

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,439
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> sig files to the messages but</font>

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,030

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,729
somebody is coming in under something

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">fake anyway so that's the second level</font>

33
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of transparency the third is the program</font>

transparency in the program committee

this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides that Steve</font>

proposals submitted for this meeting

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is low we usually get 30 to 35</font>

52
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">january-february is generally the lowest</font>

53
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,230
time for proposals I don't know why this

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,340
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we were particularly close</font>

55
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:30,510
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last meeting so out of those 19</font>

56
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,310
we accepted 14 rejected for accepted one

57
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,160
tentatively which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

58
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,930
consolidated<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program committee's</font>

59
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,030
comments and reported them back to the

60
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,990
speaker the speaker changed their talk

61
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,210
accordingly and we accepted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there</font>

62
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,670
were five late submissions these we

63
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,690
consider if they are extremely relevant

64
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:55,130
very timely or of very high quality and

65
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,130
four of those we did except this time

66
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,110
if you're curious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened</font>

67
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't read the mailing list</font>

68
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,730
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really unlikely because a</font>

69
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,649
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people have sent out notes</font>

70
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,569
these are the faces to look for to speak

71
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,000
with actually don't look for Paul he's

72
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">headed home already but he's available</font>

75
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,370
weird photo isn't it but he's here he's

76
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,500
still here you'll be heard throughout

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting as well dan and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,730
program committee and those names if not

click on general information and towards

89
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,410
the bottom there you'll find a list of

90
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,430
program committee people so some numbers

91
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,430
to absorb here

92
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,270
one thing I'm never quite sure comes

93
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,160
across on this chart the universities

94
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,930
colleges and naps those numbers

95
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,420
represent entities whereas the other

96
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:18,140
numbers represent individual people like

97
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:19,370
you and me numbers slightly down this

98
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,039
time again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

99
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,260
we're pretty close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the last meeting</font>

compared from last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this time</font>

114
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,310
these stay pretty steady

115

generally about half of you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs</font>

116
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,350
twenty percent of you are vendors and

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I paid a little more attention to</font>

120
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,800
this time it was kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting I</font>

121
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:25,560
saw the denial of service companies the

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,990
exchange points to generally identify

123

again our numbers say pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the</font>

commercial companies and twenty percent

131
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:55,859
of you don't so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is for</font>

132
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:59,229
meetings worth not exactly consecutive

133

but yeah

134
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,199
Michael<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dillon sent a very interesting</font>

135
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:04,518
message to the list in December he said

136
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,979
when he's looking four inches for

137
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,839
information on a topic and he knows he's

138
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,808
heard at some point Atlanta he Google's

139
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,309
for merits address plus the topic so if

140
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:16,129
you do that you need to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

225
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:56,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">suggest is that if you gain to host make</font>

226
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,279
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do it in the same city</font>

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,350
this time is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something may have</font>

asked why it's in Vegas<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got notice</font>

232
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,670
do it I'm based in Phoenix<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

233
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:15,889
unfortunately this is the peak season in

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">fees in Phoenix you need to have room</font>

for probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 rooms and 500 people</font>

236
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,260

242
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,989
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned after doing an hour than</font>

243
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
three times that for some reason the

244
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,460
folks of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merit in Michigan have a</font>

245

requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be in the warmth</font>

246
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:46,220
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to host it think</font>

247
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,320
about the seasons don't offer to do it

254
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,339
points of view way the network is set up

255
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,740
is from this war room over here this is

256
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,660
as you may have noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

257
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,670
actually plan ahead if you want to get

258
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,860
down to the conference area takes a

259
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,180
little bit of time to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> down here and</font>

260
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I didn't bring my segue this</font>

261
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,890

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,960
but would have been real useful yeah so

263
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,110
from a distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view the run</font>

264
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,670
goes from this network sorry this this

265
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:39,650
room is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a mdf underneath us</font>

266
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:43,689
that that run is actually a multimode

267
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:48,089
fiber goes through three hops<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,700 feet</font>

268
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:51,360
to the sprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMark</font>

269
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:55,230
that's done of multimode fiber from the

270
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,860
sprint be from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telco Demark there is</font>

a Juniper m5 the joopa m5 has an OC<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

south OC 3 back to where their facility

274
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:09,990
here in Vegas over<font color="#CCCCCC"> in OC 48 so this is</font>

275
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:13,050
predominately fiber all the way through

276
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,019
sprint did an incredible job not very

277
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,519
much notice there were some logistical

278
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,339
issues when you work with a large

279
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,999
facility like this and sprint came

280
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:26,249
through sprint were able to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the OC 3</font>

281
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:30,149
in place they<font color="#E5E5E5"> provided a native</font>

location that is reasonably

286
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,339
communications friendly in the past I've

bridges the time before that we were

291
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,620
stuck with trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bond dirty ones</font>

together the location is real important

293
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,870
just as a final thing if you do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

of time and not that much money it

302
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,760
doesn't cost hundreds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousands of</font>
