00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,120
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ITF on the topic of BGP</font>

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,879
derive requirements and do analyses of

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,710

00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:54,250
certainly are things of interest to this

<font color="#CCCCCC">community and and things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

26
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,610
we can all kind of come together in one

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,610
place to discuss this set of topics

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:31,679
so this is unfortunately this is this is

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,240
where how it ends up a little graphic a

we've got you know different when it

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,750
gets negative this is this is how it

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,230
plays out we've got the routing protocol

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,060
earlier there were some papers on it as

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,420
well there's some different solutions

44

that have been that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been some</font>

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,410
different sets of perceived requirements

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,150
you know some different idea of what

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,190
they think the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to solve and usually embed that</font>

53
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:41,530
thought we'd try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it from the the</font>

an agreed-upon set of requirements and

56
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,940
then we can do a bit of analysis of how

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:54,070
the difference of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those solutions of</font>

60
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,470
exchange among people with routing and

61
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:05,290
security backgrounds but definitely I

62
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:08,560
think a dearth of input<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you the</font>

63
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,470
operational community and and we need to

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">sit employ our best etiquette and talk</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">listen be constructive so</font>

66
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,740
here's a little bit more background of

67
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,650
what I see as some of the operational

68
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,300
things the known things that we've seen

69
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,960
improper route origination of

70
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,520

71
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,530
these are going back a number of years

72
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:41,730
but but accidental origination of 18

73
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:44,340
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> MIT S Class A that send a lot</font>

user in in Florida some years back and

76
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,780
then there's the infamous AAS 7077

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,930
everyone's routers out of memory and it

81
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,290
was pretty nasty for anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> who can</font>

82

<font color="#E5E5E5">remember then there's the malicious ones</font>

83
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,790
there's people originating antagonistic

84
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,440
or competing announcements whereas you

85
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">know where somebody wants thinks an</font>

address belongs to prefix belongs to

87
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,050
them and they send it out you know they

88
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,690
pop it up on this provider and then

89
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,960
another person says no it belongs to us

90
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,930
and in the meantime they split the 24

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">into 2 25's and and you know try and</font>

92
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,610
steal the traffic back that gets kind of

93
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,789
nasty and then there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop-up</font>

94
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,550
packing that anecdotes on I've seen at

95
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:45,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">least one instance of what seemed to be</font>

96
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that with some my own networks where</font>

97
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:52,000
people pop up and out some use some

98
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,669
unannounced space they do their bad

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,409
stuff and then they disappear so one

100
00:04:54,669 --> 00:05:00,359
really knows you know who they are where

101
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:05,050
they came from route filtering is

102
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,430
current best practice hopefully most of

103
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,289
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it I know that's been the</font>

106
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:15,270
authorized really i mean when when

107
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,710
people's people say okay well I've

108
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,419
you've got a new customer come on and

109
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,620
they say oh I've got some legacy space

110

that I'm bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> over from another</font>

their space what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you check just a</font>

113
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,270
quick who is or you know it's that is

114
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,039
that good enough that what if they've

115
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,620
changed their name and you know they've

116

been<font color="#E5E5E5"> through some corporate changes</font>

117
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,440
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's really them then</font>

118
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,930
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the projected operational</font>

119
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,840

corruption these are blind attack

123
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:56,979
approaches then you know if we take TCP

124
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,840
md5 checksum options as the protection

125
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,460
against that do we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into other</font>

126
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,388
headaches with key management how do we

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:08,010
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys around rogue employees what</font>

128
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,010
if what if somebody you know starts

129
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,430
publicizing the keys of their employer

130
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,470
and you know how does that affect things

131
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,600
and what if somebody compromises a

132
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,770
router entirely then then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">need they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know the keys</font>

134
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,719
because they've already they've already

gotten and it can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they want</font>

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,790
how we establish that<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust as is</font>

194
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,580
slightly outside the scope of the

protocol per se and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not sure if</font>

196
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,090
that's you know as I mean can we set it

197
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:24,140
aside or is it something really have to

198
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,460
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> head on at the outset and then how</font>

199
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,050
do we take what exists without

200
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,360
replicating problems I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean obviously</font>

201
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,660
all the problems that occurred that I

202
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,010
mentioned earlier like the AAS 7007

203
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,110
problem I mean all that all that all the

204
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,010
people were trusted obviously the trust

205
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,840
was what was inappropriate or

206
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:48,080
overreaching so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to just</font>

207
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of put in a bunch of pki or</font>

208
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,650
something and have the same problem

209
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:57,110
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> where where we say oh you know AAS</font>

advertisements from them because we

trust them you know that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

214
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:08,510
help guard against fat fingering much

215
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,040
less any malicious stuff what

216

inaccurate

220
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:23,829
what other choices do we have so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

221
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,140
these are definitely open questions and

222
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:29,610
hopefully people will comment on them

223
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:37,079
later during Q&A

224
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:38,640
why do this in standard there's without

225
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:43,229
some kind of standard you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know an</font>

226
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,319
operational bcp or you know at the very

227
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">least if not a standardized and</font>

228
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,810
interoperable protocol or set of

229
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,130
extensions how can we really know what

230
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,930
we're getting and how can we come

231
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,730
together as a as a community to

232
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,219
implement something if you somebody

233
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,350
else's well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do something</font>

234
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,529
and you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I think I understand</font>

235
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,250
what you're doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the person in a</font>

236
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:11,360
one hop away says all right you say that

237
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:14,190
your customer is doing something right

238
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,820
how do I know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know what they're</font>

239
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,579
doing and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I trust trust you you</font>

240
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,240
know trust them and trust you if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

241
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:26,550
really have clarity about that so that's

242
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,560
that's why we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to standardize that</font>

243
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:32,569
need to take on the work in the ITF and

244
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,569
and have it validated

245
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:41,980
so here's my advertisement cleaver plea

246
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,720

250
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:58,070
by the boards but I think you probably

251
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:01,090
just even based on what hopefully what's

252
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:03,830
presented here you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a useful and</font>

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,960
through a few and then sandy Murphy we

were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have Doug Montgomery from</font>

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,180
sport than a true professional tip to

280
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,300
come in at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last minute</font>

281
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:28,319
and work up some slides a few slides to

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:34,699
present and she's done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of work on</font>

vgp analysis and of the current EGP

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:41,400
expected and so she's got always<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

285
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:44,710
things to say hopefully we'll have good

286
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,840
interaction from the floor and and

287
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">may be few in a little panel discussion</font>

288
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,760
so that's I'd like to encourage that

289
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,650
later on and further ado

290
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,360

there are two mechanisms for protecting

that it precedes some of the work in

IPSec that was done to provide replay

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,490
going to get keys to all those many many

356
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:01,460
routers I heard AT&T mentioned as having

357
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:04,580
15,000 routers can't imagine how you

358
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,010
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of that information and then</font>

359
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,889
you not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have to get the keys there</font>

360
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:12,140
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the keys</font>

361
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:16,250
occasionally you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to replace them</font>

362
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:18,919
just as as a good security move it's

363
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,929
been used often enough you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to think</font>

364
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">about going to a new key and you have to</font>

365
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:25,760
worry about the problem of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out</font>

366
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,710
that he's been compromised in some

367
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,760
and you want to replace it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a new</font>

368
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:34,310
key so how do you accomplish those tasks

369
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,870
and any sort of reasonable amount of

370
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:39,560
time with a reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of effort</font>

371
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:44,659
and there's real need for tools to help

372
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:47,870
make this feel ok so then origination

373
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,720
protection so you can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two kinds of</font>

374
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,939
origination protection you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have</font>

375
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,740
protection that will show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that the a</font>

376
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">s is authorized to advertise the address</font>

377
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,750
or you can have protection that would

378
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:07,010
say the a s is not only authorized to

379
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:09,950
and advertise this address but it is now

380
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:12,290
currently doing the advertisement it

381
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,410
doesn't help for those people who are

382
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,629
using allocated but not yet announced

383
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,490
space it doesn't protect against<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

384
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,240
just if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the AAS is</font>

385
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,370
authorized<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so then you have to delve</font>

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,220
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deep and thorny question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

394
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,390

going to do about aggregates what are

396

you need some way to communicate this

author the secure information to the

00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,650
therefore it might be possible to not

what residual vulnerabilities do you

588
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,190
this was a fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> one a great initial topic</font>

594

00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:13,960
rather hard to solve that but it's a

596
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,250
goal that we're supposed to strive for

597
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,070
since it should rather rather than a

598
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:22,130

00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,639
system ids system you know should allow

730
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:52,699
you to identify that someone's inserted

731
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,889
bogus information so one of the things

732
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the draft attempts to push forward</font>

733
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,140
is that that the methods for logging and

734
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,060
tracking information need to be

735
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,310
standardized so that any router that you

736
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,990
log into or gather information from

737
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,630
should report in a format that you can

738
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:11,240
correlate with other types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of routers so</font>

739
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:14,060
that might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an area</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of focus it must</font>

740
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,290
provide for logging this should does

741
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,690
should know by the way that should for

742
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,540
non-repudiation is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

743
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,890
reputation gets to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal term and</font>

744
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,750
folks are very nervous about use<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

745
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:27,379
term especially security folks

746
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:29,810
apparently and the the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

747
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,540
nervousness is understood you know if

748
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,710
you've said that you you're completely

749
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:36,500
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to non repudiate every</font>

750
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:39,680
update that means that that any<font color="#E5E5E5"> mistake</font>

751
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">could be blamed on you</font>

752
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,830
must be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provide for logging</font>

753
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:49,130
again that's in standard form

754
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:53,950
transport protection the mechanism that

755
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:57,380
is used to secure origin and ASM should

756
00:35:53,950 --> 00:36:00,319
include transport protection in other

757
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:04,040
words we're already very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> close and</font>

758
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:09,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to solve the tcp md5 an IPSec</font>

759
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:11,570
but City issues already so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

760
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,910
help immensely in terms of the operators

761
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:16,250
is to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the existing</font>

762
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,960
transport protection or to modify the

763
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:20,660
existing transport protection system

764
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,900
such that it takes into account or it

765
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:27,290
works with the origination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of prefixes</font>

766
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:29,180
system what I pushed for just in terms

767
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,279
of ease of implementation is a single

768
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,810
keeper is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that single keeping the same</font>

769
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,670
one that secures your system security

770
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:37,150
with your peers as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as your</font>

771
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,150
origination

772
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,130
so questions how should the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf handle</font>

773
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,799
proposed security mechanisms as as we've

774
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:48,950
stated there several should we form a

775
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:52,759
design team advance any proposed system

776
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:56,919
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements and revisited any other</font>

777
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:59,779
options we're looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bones and</font>

778
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,730
with that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be</font>

779
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:05,180
Danny's Islamic

780
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,180
please

781
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:14,370
I didn't actually have a slide till

782
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,930
about 14 minutes ago so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of the</font>

783
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,069
gratuitous panel member i was just

784
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,960
setting up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i was involved</font>

785
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">in from the initial work the generic</font>

786
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,340
routing protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> security stuff and and</font>

787
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,050
helping rust and you know everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

788
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">see up here kicked the work off in apts</font>

789
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,620
so i actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

790
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,810
questions I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a show of</font>

791
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:34,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands from folks thought how many people</font>

792
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:37,259
actually care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the room so</font>

793
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:39,569
all right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so with the next</font>

794
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,160
question here is a one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

795
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,540
actually been involved or participated

796
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,540
in any way with this work in the idea

797
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:51,750
it's all I am so up so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that</font>

798
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,220
doesn't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> for itself I mean I myself</font>

799
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,630
and you know a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other folks</font>

800
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">there seem to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like kind of a core</font>

801
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,450
team that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a</font>

802
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,890
lot of work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this isn't</font>

803
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,169
the sexy thing and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not immediately</font>

804
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,540
deployable might not but it affects

805
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,710
everyone in the room and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know my</font>

806
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,970
point there and you know we've done the

807
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,140
same thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know with apricot and</font>

808
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,399
right when we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the folks there</font>

809
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,620
about dinner and grinding protocol

810
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,150
security stuff and the documents they've

811
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,410
been posted in an oven some of the other

812
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,240
end of the right stuff and some of the

813
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,770
other you know

814
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,290
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> here operator areas in a work</font>

815
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:19,700
times and you know I mean your feedback

816
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,290
matters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it doesn't you know</font>

817
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't cost anything to become involved</font>

818
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this it just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your time</font>

819
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,600
and getting involved you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with this</font>

820
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,070
stage and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh so I mean I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

821
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">show of hands there with the second</font>

822
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,580
question kind of speaks for itself so if

823
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,530
you actually care about this then should

824
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,880
become involved otherwise we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

825
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear your criticism in a few months</font>

826
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you see something published okay so</font>

827
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,550
that's that's it that's all that i

828
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,550
actually had inspected

829
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:53,320
the community for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Annie says</font>

830
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:57,820
it's not sexy it also doesn't make you

831
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:00,100
any money probably at all however there

832
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:03,040
may be made this would be the subject of

833
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:07,330
future<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFPs you receive I don't know</font>

834
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,630
from cus potential customers maybe it's

835
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,630
part of

836
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,870
procurement government procurement

837
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:19,700
requirements who knows a<font color="#E5E5E5"> or liability</font>

838
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:22,490
insurance so it may become important to

839
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:25,669
you in ways that that you don't foresee

840
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:28,129
or none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> received and hard to say</font>

841
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:31,610
what you know if we want those things to

842
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:35,150
happen but but the time to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

843
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:37,870
reigns is now obviously and we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

844
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,880
hear from you for instance that the

845
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:45,259
question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AAS pass securities is</font>

846
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,870
been possibly the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotly debated one</font>

847
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,750
on the email list and we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear</font>

848
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:52,759
from people for instance on on that

849
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,580
topic

850
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">lame actually I wanted to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a point</font>

851
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:01,490
rus-rus came up here to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

852
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,970
that the path of the routing update does

853
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:06,649
not necessarily traverse the a s pad and

854
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:10,310
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be one of the one of the</font>

855
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:12,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">points of me to keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it right so so</font>

856
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:15,200
please come up in sandy has something

857
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,610
else to say let's see some other shadowy

858
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,740
figure making its way to life but

859
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:21,860
support for it's at least a question we

860
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:26,799
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it right is that true isn't</font>

861
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,800
that true what relation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that happen</font>

862
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:35,990
I'm actually interested in the second

863
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:40,700
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sequence that I talked</font>

864
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:43,609
about the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authorize and</font>

865
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:47,029
authenticate origination of addresses

866
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:50,299
the a s path is very protection is very

867
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:52,369
contentious but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think that if we</font>

868
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:54,650
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we do not solve the</font>

869
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:57,349
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being able to authorize and</font>

870
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:59,539
authenticate address advertisements

871
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:01,609
there's no point of going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

872
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:03,110
additional step of looking at how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

873
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:08,020
protect me as

874
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:13,360
so anyone who has comments about

875
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:14,620
how they might feel about<font color="#E5E5E5"> databases that</font>

876
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,210
would have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

877
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,859
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those databases the</font>

878
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements for interaction with those</font>

879
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,810
databases

880
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:23,890
be interested in hearing

881
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,890
those kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> words</font>

882
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,420
anybody so that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll take that to</font>

883
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,590
mean everyone's cool with just using the

884
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">irr come on please somebody come up say</font>

885
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,440
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything good bad or</font>

886
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,730
indifferent woody what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

887
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,330
should have what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think should not</font>

888
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:45,210
happen I mean that that's possibly a

889
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:47,670
deployment implementation or deployment

890
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:51,420
detail that that's a little further out

891
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:54,030
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's it's not too too soon</font>

892
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,360
to start discussing it thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

893
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know forming a vision anybody</font>

894
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,500
somebody's making his way to the mic

895
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:05,490
that's great please state your name<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

896
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:07,380
all that David Barack<font color="#CCCCCC"> SBC just a just a</font>

897
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:11,180
question about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blaine about the</font>

898
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:13,920
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have one key</font>

899
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:17,609
however you do it / a s how do you

900
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,990
change it that's that's the question for

901
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:21,120
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> people it's going to be</font>

902
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,759
okay so that's their question that's

903
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,640
their problem got it existence operator

904
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,620
there's this old joke that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll ask</font>

905
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,080
you myself a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question and you ask</font>

906
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:33,299
yourself a question and whoever can

907
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,920
answer their own question wins and my

908
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,390
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how does the rabbit get to</font>

909
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,370
the bottom of the hole well it starts at

910
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,259
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dicks to the top and the</font>

911
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:41,940
victim naturally says well how does he

912
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,230
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom ah that's your</font>

913
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,270
question

914
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,400
that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of when people say</font>

915
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:49,530
instead of requirement and then say and

916
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,810
the security people will solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> historic</font>

917
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,820
while key rolling is one of the things

918
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:56,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put in the requirements document</font>

919
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,920
I certainly didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to presume and</font>

920
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:01,890
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective to state how that</font>

921
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,520
sort of thing would be accomplished so

922
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,589
raising any it when as an operator

923
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,300
trying to feed into this form if I raise

924
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:12,720
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that smells like a</font>

925
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:15,869
solution I get smacked so instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

926
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,520
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set solutions what I'm trying</font>

927
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:19,710
to do with this document at least is set

928
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,020
requirements and see if we can find

929
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,940
solutions that fit them there are

930
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,730
several mechanisms available for rolling

931
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,460
keys that that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could have</font>

932
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:31,680
it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up once and then</font>

933
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget it and let it roll for example is</font>

934
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,759
one mechanism then how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you set it</font>

935
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,460
again so there's there are mechanisms

936
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,290
out there for changing keys the TCP md5

937
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:44,270
version of changing keys is horrible and

938
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:47,220
I think we all the there's other and

939
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:50,160
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandy can speak to at least one or</font>

940
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:53,490
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the methods of changing keys all</font>

941
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,960
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe someone can speak</font>

942
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,500
to some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the methods for changing keys</font>

943
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,450
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an important topic that</font>

944
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:02,480
there's also the point that if you have

945
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:07,009
one keeper a s that means that each of

946
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,860
your peers has to be willing to

947
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:12,320
appear with you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that type of</font>

948
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:15,020
cryptography and that isn't always the

949
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,310
case and if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different peers who</font>

950
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,630
want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types of</font>

951
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,970
cryptography you're not going to be able

952
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,430
to use just one key and we did make that

953
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:24,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">azz I think as a result of that exact</font>

954
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,520
question

955
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,440
Mirman

956
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,569
hello my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Richard jimerson camara</font>

957
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,830
I just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to state for everyone here</font>

958
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:37,600
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rirs are very interested / tips</font>

959
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:40,690
participants and observers of what's

960
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:46,350
going on inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF in regard to bgp</font>

961
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:48,880
security and state that there is a

00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:51,040
organizational meeting of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> er stamps</font>

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,770
going on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming weeks at the</font>

apricot meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> kyoto they're actually</font>

965
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,980
going to sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

966
00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:01,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's on the table and go</font>

967
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:03,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">into a higher phase of organization</font>

968
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,879
amongst the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rirs themselves its prepare</font>

969
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,649
for assumed to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eventual set of</font>

970
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,030
changes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take place with each</font>

971
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:15,010
of us that will involve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rer</font>

972
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:18,340
databases and and it's risen risen to a

973
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:23,320
top level of priority inside management

974
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:24,850
of the rars and just generally stay for

975
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,790
everyone we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

976
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:30,220
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> participating and we are ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

977
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,380
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> some quite significant changes and</font>

978
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:36,490
moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> one question for you are</font>

979
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:39,240
you willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do bgp i think they've</font>

980
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:41,500
you only do bgp yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> just check</font>

981
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,180
that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the concerns I heard</font>

982
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,520
mentioned from someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna that</font>

983
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:48,440
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be you know sitting</font>

984
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,180
sort of at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of the tree</font>

00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,089
being a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> source of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> potential</font>

986
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:54,919
failure right you know I would reserve I

987
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:57,140
would reserve then you know that that

988
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,490
type a decision for the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

989
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:00,890
more closely participating in the

990
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,859
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but they are talking about a</font>

991
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:06,890
great deal can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mention anything</font>

992
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:09,828
about what you have planned to address

993
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:13,098
as far as security is concerned well at

994
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:14,780
each of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rirs when it comes to</font>

00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,369
we've each been independently working

997
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,500
inside of our region's provide better

998
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:27,260
options for folks for instance I can

like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin is</font>

why we're holding this planning meeting

00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:16,790
dots Beth question

1016
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:18,620
um maybe I'm overstating the obvious but

1017
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:21,808
if you have a shared secret key that you

1018
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:23,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">share with everyone so much of a secret</font>

1019
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:26,339
well this is public private keys right

1020
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way it simpler today</font>

1021
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:31,828
though right sorry it's that's not the

1022
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:32,910
way the md5 is implemented a no and

1023
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:34,589
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font>

1024
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:38,939
problem and that's why that's a big

1025
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:43,199
reason why md5 so horrible right manish

1026
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:45,989
career merit my question is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1027
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,599
more basic it's about it's actually a

1028
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:51,630
question about what used to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1029
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:53,910
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IDF that is is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1030
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,219
working code and if so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

1031
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:58,319
projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1032
00:47:56,219 --> 00:48:03,329
implementing pieces of this and that we

1033
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:07,769
can start using we should we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

1034
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:12,509
some router vendors to step up now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw</font>

1035
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:15,419
one up at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the microphone Russ and Pedro</font>

1036
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:17,640
is coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so one question</font>

1037
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:23,309
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much shona better networks</font>

1038
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:26,788
and why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do why don't you</font>

1039
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:29,369
decouple the problem of figuring out

1040
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:36,059
which a<font color="#CCCCCC"> esas are allowed to advertise</font>

1041
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:39,269
want from bgp even if even if you need

1042
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:41,670
to add some information to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing</font>

1043
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:44,669
system to propagate that that could

1044
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:47,579
always be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done okay</font>

1045
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I think the concern at least my</font>

1046
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:53,010
concern is an operator is is anything

1047
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:55,950
that that pulls the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution of IP</font>

1048
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:59,819
information sort of out of the the

1049
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:02,098
network itself and in terms of keeping

1050
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:03,930
things that's one of the reasons why you

1051
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,210
know we were kind of fond of keeping bgp

1052
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:09,390
in band right if you add an<font color="#CCCCCC"> l2 network</font>

1053
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:12,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you dropped a session bgp knew about</font>

1054
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:15,150
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I from my perspective at</font>

1055
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:19,410
least I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that the more closely</font>

1056
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:22,260
attuned the security information for

1057
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:25,500
those prefixes is with bgp the safer it

1058
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,180
is as as a means of distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1059
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,430
disagree it can be decoupled I'm just

1060
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:31,529
that that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my first blush it</font>

1061
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:35,919
it's from the hardest problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1062
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:42,109
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve is figuring out you know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1063
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:45,140
distribute delegate the authority of

1064
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:49,640
assigning and advertising prefixes you

1065
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:53,118
don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to modify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP to actually do</font>

1066
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,910
any of junk and so you could go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font>

1067
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,660
solve that problem that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1068
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:05,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">be transported transparently into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

1069
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:08,720
and you know not how to do things again

1070
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:10,460
so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned database downloads as one</font>

1071
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,270
possibility of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to get that sort of</font>

1072
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,270
information around

1073
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:18,930
there's a bit of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if you want</font>

1074
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:23,020
to protect whether the

1075
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:24,680

<font color="#E5E5E5">currently part of it kind of implies</font>

1079
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:35,920
that it needs to get transmitted

1080
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:41,299
more immediacy than a database down

1081
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:43,450
there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been people who have objected</font>

1082
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,950
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that</font>

presenting somewhat of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chicken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and egg</font>

1084
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:52,180
problem if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your routing is not working</font>

1085
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,069
database down

1086
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,558
where's bill Manning I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

1087
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:59,170
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the spear fans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's I</font>

1088
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that in reply to Pedro a little</font>

1089
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:09,460
bit by the way I'm I'm Russ white cisco

1090
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:13,119
routing our consent anyway is that part

1091
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:14,680
of the problem we're facing is if the

1092
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,720
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the routing information</font>

1093
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,129
for instance what's andys talking about

1094
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,009
where the downloaded database or

1095
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:24,099
something like that is so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> off of</font>

1096
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:25,869
current bgp convergence times which

1097
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:28,510
aren't very fast but could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get faster in</font>

1098
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:30,369
the future then you end up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1099
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,530
situation where you have the database

1100
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:34,390
saying one thing that's secure and the

1101
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:36,190
routing information in the system saying

1102
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,078
something different and you have to

1103
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:40,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which one to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe in etc</font>

1104
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,160
etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to slow down bgp</font>

convergence wedding on secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> database</font>

1106
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,779
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not saying that</font>

1107
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:48,069
database downloaders valid or invalid in

1108
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,200
that environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just saying that's</font>

1109
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:53,240
a problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we come in to look at</font>

1110
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Blanes requirements on the</font>

1111
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">quick procedural comment there's two</font>

1112
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:00,040
people left in line after that

1113
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:02,890
cut it off sleep in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your budget</font>

1114
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,350
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you can prove that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1115
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:08,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">can solve this problem with the database</font>

1116
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:11,319
download we can stuff the data into<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

1117
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,210
that's not a problem I think we I think

1118
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,140
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prove the end that the</font>

1119
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:20,670
problem of delegating can be solved and

1120
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:24,400
to russ's comment of time lag between

1121
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:27,300
database is the timeline because of the

1122
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:31,690
database distribution are because the

1123
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:35,700
delegation mechanism itself is a time

1124
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:38,500
lag and you know there's two problems

1125
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,750
generating information and distributing

1126
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,090
information if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> this generate yeah and I think</font>

1129
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,510
that's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1130

values that I think you get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1131
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:52,600
distributed trust model right because

1132
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,310
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear it from a few</font>

1133
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,110
different sources and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully that can</font>

1134
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,759
help speed things up as opposed to kind

1135

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottlenecking your way up but I</font>

dan Goulding just as someone who's not

00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">really involved with this particular</font>

1139
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:14,200
quick question this seems to be as an

1140
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:16,150
observer sort of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay better best sort</font>

1141
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,580
of thing where people are are going for

1142
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:20,560
best when they could really easily have

1143
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:23,140
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's been going for a</font>

1144
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,120
long time is there some for the people

1145
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">of over the process is there's some buys</font>

1146
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,230
or some reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not interested in</font>

1147
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,600
just using DNS for this I'm DNS is a

1148
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:33,700
database that has you know IP addresses

1149
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,980
is controlled by the people who control

1150
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,410
the IP addresses you put in a resource

1151
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:41,050
record for an AS number and you know at

1152
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:43,299
that point you have you know a positive

1153
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:46,000
association between prefix and a s

1162
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:11,790
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's somewhat lukewarm</font>

1163
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:15,900
reception i mean i remember now in 98 or

1164

something it was presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it for</font>

didn't it didn't go very far feel free

1167
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try and reawaken it i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

1168
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:26,970
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you know I always kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1169
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:29,279
one at one of the and this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1170
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,660
to be unadulterated opinion and you know

1171
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,270
it's not representative of the entire

1172
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:35,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">group I suspect but one of one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1173
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,759
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I always had trouble with</font>

1174
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,500
was any time I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make my router go</font>

1175
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,480
external to the router itself or

1176
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:46,410
external to the set of routers to

1177
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,810
discover its brain what what concerns me

1178
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:51,690
is that in it this actually goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1179
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:54,570
the database as well right if we if we

1180
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:57,000
externalize the process for securing and

1181
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:59,040
distributing this information we're

1182
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,170
creating a situation where problems with

1183
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,759
the server's of the services create it

1184
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,530
make an impossible situation for

1185
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,110
recovering so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like the route</font>

1186
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:08,340
again this is all my personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

1187
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,170
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router to be able to discover</font>

1188
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:14,280
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about everything that it needs to</font>

1189
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:16,050
about itself to bring up IP and and then

1190
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,090
I like to have the servers for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

1191
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:20,910
services and stuff so I guess I kind of

1192
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:23,320
again that's just my opinion and there's

1193
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,940
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those in this room yourself</font>

1194
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,830
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all talk about it later</font>

1195
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:29,200
i thess folks I suspect they're like no

1196
