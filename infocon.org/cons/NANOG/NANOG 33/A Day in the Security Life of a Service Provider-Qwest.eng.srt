that was my initial theory I thought

75
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,879
geez someone's trying to fingerprint the

76
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:51,170

the symptoms<font color="#E5E5E5"> method of fingerprinted dns</font>

81
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:05,299

82
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,340
that's been done by professional

83
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:10,250
researchers for legitimate reasons and

84
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,879
by worms and hackers for malicious

85
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,940

87
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,949
this a new one that was my question we

88
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,759
discussed it oh there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security tab</font>

90
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,000
block chaos simply set up a chaos zone

91
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,979
make a root hints file that points to

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,169
Deb know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people try to do version</font>

93
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:39,310
or authors out of the chaos domain

94
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,310
they'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a failure</font>

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,120
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like as a fingerprinting</font>

96

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,480
pour another ISC handler told me several

98
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,430
times fragments that are not the initial

99
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,100
fragment should not produce a response

100
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,760
from any OS if the initial fragment

101
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,150
arrives to an OS after the timeout the

102
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,650
fragment they should send back an ICMP

103
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,049
fragment error of some sort timeout

104
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:14,060
error but if you don't get the initial

105
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,910
fragment your OS should not respond all

106
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,780
these fragments were starting at the 512

107
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:24,220
byte so no ass should respond to this so

108
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,219
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the ants fingerprint</font>

109
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,719

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:36,580
could be a direct attack may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

111
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:39,849
they would consume a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS resources</font>

112
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,500
if you set fragments to an OS the OS has

113
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:42,580
to hold on those fragments waiting for

114

the rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fragments to arrive</font>

probably was that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the 6th</font>

must recommend mitigation steps if we

find a vulnerability as security just

261
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,600
finding a hole isn't good enough we have

to try to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a way to mitigate</font>

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,519
at least the effects of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack and</font>

264
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,000
then we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test that mitigation see</font>

if it actually works

266
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:09,529
among other things i also get escalated

267
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:11,959
attacks so some attacks are escalated to

427
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,299
about what other tools people are using

<font color="#CCCCCC">what else people are using there's</font>

433
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,850
always tools out there that I hadn't

434
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,529
looked at do you have a like a website

435
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,059
with a list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those tools those of us</font>

436
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,919
who might be interested in performing

437
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:58,149
some of the types of tests are talking

00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">about I don't have one yes I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

availability information stuff out there

443
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:12,389
tools are ultimately very easy to find

00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,488
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> xplode tools for a talk I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">justin list of tools thank you look</font>

451
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:36,920
hi donal<font color="#CCCCCC"> virendra got stupid question</font>

452
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:39,979
first one as this effort is extended to

453
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,190
asia pac we<font color="#E5E5E5"> MEA and secondly how does</font>

454
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,320
this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand this is n</font>

455
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">SP centric effort how does this</font>

456
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:53,169
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> trickles down to enterprise</font>

457
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:56,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other may be small organization</font>

458
00:21:53,170 --> 00:22:02,240
I'm sure we can you know folks in that

459
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:06,740
area can make use of this expertise kind

460
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,710
of be valuable elves long questions I'll

461
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:12,980
start with the first one we<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp list</font>

462
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,920
is not us centric we have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

463
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,780
there from all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

465
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,170
operators group but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe you guys</font>

466
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,419
are fairly open I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here</font>

467
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,240
that work from the North America as far

468
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,630
as I can tell and I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

469
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,840
people here from Asia etc etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

470
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:35,470
not exposed list in

471
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,939
nature of say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the us-cert or department</font>

472
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,820
homeland security or any of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

473
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,010
it's not a u.s. effort certainly got a

474
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,510
lot of us professional people on there

475
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,990
but there's people from all over the

476
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:51,750
world so that that part is not an issue

477
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:54,520
as to filtering down to the enterprise

478
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,220
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that vulnerability announcement</font>

479
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,379
kind of stuff is done by the vendors

480
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:03,580
hopefully through sir sorts hicieron is

481
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,529
CC in those cases if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a large</font>

482
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough enterprise and you contact the</font>

483
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:10,000
cert team and you start to work with

484
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,559
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in some cases the</font>

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones that they can and really</font>

486
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,370
vulnerability announcement they may not

487
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the information you need</font>

488
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,908
but they may tell you what you need to

489
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:21,809
do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix your problems or the areas</font>

490
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:21,809
that you should be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

491
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:29,320
everybody I heard a lot about how do i

492
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,530
get vulnerability announcements how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

493
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,840
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> him early honestly mostly exploits</font>

494
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,399
we see today are from zero-day

495
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,520
vulnerabilities they're from stuff

496
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,560
that's two months or six months old

497
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,360
almost every XP box that I've seen it's

498
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,889
been hacked in the last six months this

499
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,360
hack was something that was three four

500
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:51,340
patches ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> have anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements are a good</font>

502
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,300
hot topic for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp security walk and</font>

503
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,530
I believe it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me discuss</font>

504
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you've been talking about a lot</font>

505
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,720
lately

506
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:04,780
that one question to have this works in

507
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,340
your testing how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find how easy do</font>

508
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">you find it to be to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

509
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,010
vendors of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the equipment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

510
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,520
testing to feedback information you get

511
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,020
a nice how money works money works real

512
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,910
well when we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy your</font>

513
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,110
product if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we request is considering</font>

514
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:19,240
buying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new product or buying a bunch</font>

515
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,250
of your products we put in our labs we

516
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,810
test it all for performance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

517
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:27,100
if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't pass they can't do the job</font>

518
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,040
is supposed to do and do it fairly

519
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,320
securely we won't buy it so that works

520
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,120
real well we've announced to the vendors

521
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,060
vulnerabilities that have in fact

522
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,399
actually stayed unpatched<font color="#E5E5E5"> and unfixed</font>

523
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:43,110
for years but then we didn't buy there

524
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,110
was that gear either so

525
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,970
