1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,960
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this good can people here okay</font>

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,870
so this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,019
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I think like I would figure</font>

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,209
that most of you like myself really

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,560
never heard of this before and I

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,630
encountered I<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mass is what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in</font>

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,330
the process of doing some work it's at

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,009
cisco and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,709
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think people ought to</font>

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">be aware that's going on and it's a I'll</font>

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,520
tell you it's a qualitatively different

12
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,410
thing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it looks</font>

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,239
like kind of an application layer thing

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,489
and we're usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> used we used to do in</font>

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
transport kind of things but as we go

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,390
through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out where</font>

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,219
where this is going to impact things if

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,899
it really happens so i'll do the goals

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,579
and objectives a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,469
introduction and overview and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,660
get up on my might what seems to be a

22
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,800
growing soapbox about the complexity of

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,199
this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might mean so um</font>

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,718
it's an awareness-raising thing and i

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,009
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know i think in that in my</font>

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,080
experience with<font color="#E5E5E5"> nan out there have been</font>

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,729
a few awareness-raising kind of things

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,899
but normally it's an operational form so

29
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,780
we don't get this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a little</font>

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and feedback on that point</font>

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,240
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be probably useful for us as</font>

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,150
program committee um so that so it's a

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,860
it's awareness-raising<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in two hours</font>

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,729
or three hours or 10 hours or two weeks

35
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't think you could really</font>

36
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,080
understand this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of level of</font>

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,280
deep level of detail but hopefully

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,189
you'll get some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of idea of what</font>

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,930
it's about and what it means and these

40
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,158
slides if anybody happens to want them

41
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,600
are out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,340
really want to dive into this there's

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,500
any amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of literature you might want</font>

44
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,439
to have and feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to contact me if</font>

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,399
you want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or i can give you pointers</font>

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,529
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this all about well so I her</font>

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,049
there's another acronym there's a bunch

48
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,119
of acronyms that match ims but I ms in

49
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,280
this context<font color="#E5E5E5"> it stands for IP multimedia</font>

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,790
subsystem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really being</font>

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,409
positioned by the 3gpp or the third

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,329
generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> partnership project these are</font>

53
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,129
that you know the 3g phone people

54
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,500
wireless people and it's their

55
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,209
architecture to converge both the

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,710
wireless and wireline networks and this

57
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,350
is kind of

58
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:18,740
where it can hurt us all or affect us

59
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,030
all and voice in multimedia data and as

60
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,860
you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this you start</font>

61
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,930
asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> well is it really doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

62
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,080
that's something for folks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking</font>

63
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,480
at and basically if you just take it to

64
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the basic level it's it's an attempt to</font>

65
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,119
create us you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> till fun telephoning</font>

66
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,040
standard infrastructure for IP that

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,690
would evolve into a replacement for all

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,630
of the circuits which stuff but as we'll

69
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,020
see it's kind of it's a kind of a lofty

70
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,910
goal but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really near that and</font>

71
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,210
then another another thing to notice is

72
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,460
that ims itself is being proposed as

73
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,110
sort of a wireline control services

74
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,210
control plane so that kind of means that

75
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">even though some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us might not be in</font>

76
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:02,570
the wireless or cellular business this

77
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,010
could turn up anywhere if if it really

78
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,049
takes off the way that the proponents

79
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,250
want so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about this and</font>

80
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,470
trying to understand what this really

81
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,670
meant in terms of the kind of networking

82
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,830
that I'm used to doing or that I

83
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,880
understand because I have I as many of

84
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I didn't really come from a</font>

85
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,049
voice background and this stuff is all

86
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,940
being driven<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the voice side and so</font>

87
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,980
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to find a you know</font>

88
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,480
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we all understood that</font>

89
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,920
had been said by somebody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our field</font>

90
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,769
that I could relate this to and I

91
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,970
remember one of the first at one of the

92
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,350
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> einat's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if this was</font>

93
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first sign and it was in Montreal</font>

94
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,519
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a t-shirt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some folks</font>

95
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,230
had and it was that Randy had said this

96
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,640
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just build a highway we don't fix</font>

97
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:42,560
your car it's kind of a statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

98
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,570
end-to-end principle in a way but by

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,070
analogy ims is attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build part</font>

100
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,630
of your car's engine brakes and

101
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,760
navigational systems into the highway

102
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,410
itself which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really something that</font>

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,739
some of us might want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at or all</font>

104
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,600
of us and it it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that really</font>

105
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">it has a billing model that's based on</font>

106
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,530
where you're going in your car and who's

107
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,840
writing in it and it um well yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

108
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way that means that the system the</font>

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,690
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that's</font>

110
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,130
that's that's a pretty frightening for

111
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,079
us who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at state in the core</font>

112
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,940
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and in short really what</font>

113
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,109
I ms has is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary design goal is</font>

114
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,760
to try to couple the higher layer

115
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,469
services that you might get like what

116
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,469
you get from your cell carrier directly

117
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,440
to the packet transport and we'll see

118
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,680
how that happened

119
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,010
but it's a design goal which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font>

120
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,600
the anti design goal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us but</font>

121
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,520
generally oh and then here's a little

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,320
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the soapbox thing that kind of</font>

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,450
coupling is one of the main places where

124
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,790
you'll get unexpected complexity out of

125
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,440
a dynamic system like the internet and I

126
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,580
talked a little bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on Sunday</font>

127
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,060
and you can see my there's a

128
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,570
pointer to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides um so the question</font>

129
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,920
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> um really what would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do</font>

130
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,560
to support this and we'll talk about

131
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,180
what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> but um that's the thing that</font>

132
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like people to think about through all</font>

133
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,260
of this talk not whether or not it's

134
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,390
good or bad or indifferent but if it

135
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,010
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen what would you have to do</font>

136
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,800
to support it in your in your transport

137
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,830
network so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the kind of</font>

138
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,960
differences to include well the voice

139
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,659
architecture is something that many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

140
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">us who haven't come from the voice site</font>

141
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,070
don't really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really map well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font>

142
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet architecture and you know</font>

143
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,130
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things like packet switching</font>

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,200
versus circuit switching in there that

145
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,420
that really need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at there's</font>

146
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,010
inbound signaling um like we have with

147
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:33,330
IP and there's out of bounds signaling

148
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,620
like you have with ss7 there's qos and

149
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">building architectures that are</font>

150
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,130
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's provided provider</font>

151
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,770
mediated sessions which means qos and

152
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,270
policy mediated by providers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

153
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,830
middle of your connection versus what

154
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,500
we're used to which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ndn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> principle</font>

155
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,680
more or less intelligence along the

156
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,120
edges so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can talk a little</font>

157
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,890
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the implications of that</font>

158
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,260
one and then there's the whole walled

159
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,090
garden versus internet business model

160
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,230
walled garden where your service

161
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,659
provider gives you a set of applications

162
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,760
like in your cell phone first is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

163
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet where it's a more open</font>

164
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,580
environment and these go on but these

165
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,900
are for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about so the next</font>

166
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,280
question somebody might want to ask is

167
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,609
well it you know is how real is this

168
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,489
thing well it's fairly real in the sense

169
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,350
that many many care carriers and all

170
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,820
kinds of standards organizations are

171
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,800
going a million miles an hour trying to

172
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,780
implement it and flush out the standards

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'll say it's somewhat controversial</font>

174
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:36,239
and why well because it's as you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

175
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,849
in a minute it's a fairly complex system

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,259
standard as opposed to but that's an

177
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,699
interesting thing to it's a system

178
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,990
standard right at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF we don't</font>

179
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,150
build system standards we build

180
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,479
components protocols they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font>

181
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,888
into systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> IMS is a system so it's</font>

182
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,180
fairly controversial because it's not

183
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,590
clear how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much of this stuff will</font>

184
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,919
actually ever be implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

185
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,299
the complexity threshold is so there's

186
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,190
all kinds of standards activity around

187
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,660
this um and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that in a</font>

188
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,960
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a several priests</font>

189
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,310
standards on deployments you know

190
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,888
push-to-talk present space things like

191
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's all kinds of other</font>

192
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to figure out how</font>

193
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,120
real this is people have webinars on it

194
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,289
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know plug ims into your search</font>

195
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,669
engine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you'll get all kinds of stuff</font>

196
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:22,229
in there but some of it will be related

197
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:25,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the assignments so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was first</font>

198
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,400
doing this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was kind of</font>

199
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,039
asking a few people from the internet

200
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,539
side of the world you know what they

201
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,060
thought about this and how it was how

202
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,659
this was unfolding and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

203
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was asked to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be by several people</font>

204
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,520
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of give some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the alphabet soup</font>

205
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,630
so here goes that so I don't know we we

206
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,130
usually think about our standards

207
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,310
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF but there's a</font>

208
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,539
more general standards environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

209
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,889
there and we generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> call these things</font>

210
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,570
stos so there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU hey how many</font>

211
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:58,409
folks have ever been<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an ITU meeting</font>

212
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,909
or ever read an ITU document really

213
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,560
that's quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them that's that's</font>

214
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:06,539
quite a few that's interesting how about

215
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,490
3gpp that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then</font>

216
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:12,449
there's 3gpp2<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on forever</font>

217
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,520
there's etsy there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Addis I mean this</font>

218
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,199
just goes on forever right so this is

219
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,080
this also plug if you can't find a

220
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,280
standard sto to work in and you're a

221
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,870
service provider who wants to

222
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,400
participate come on up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can like</font>

223
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,830
find one with the right set of letters

224
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,150
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> plenty of them oh yeah and of</font>

225
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,930
course there's the IETF it has something

226
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:33,750
to do with this so more ims is the

227
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,729
intermediate IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner multimedia</font>

228
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,349
subsystem so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

229
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,729
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these because there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

230
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,289
these there's a lot of terminology in

231
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,000
here that's not familiar to me or or

232
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,740
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least when I started and</font>

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,630
definitely isn't to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of us I'm</font>

234
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,040
sure but this thing is pretty a pretty

235
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,840
important component you'll see how it

236
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">works but it's called a call set a CS</font>

237
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,000
f is a call session control function and

238
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,319
there are various types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these and</font>

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,390
we'll see in a second what they are but

240
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,460
basically they're like sip proxies and

241
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:03,090
they're like session border controllers

242
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,770
and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and then there's</font>

243
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,160
a home subscriber server and that kind

244
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,710
of replaces the what were called home

245
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,810
location registry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> visit location</font>

246
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,600
registry in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile in the mobile</font>

247
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,310
world and then there's all these other

248
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,620
standards that i don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anybody</font>

249
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:23,550
has a phone that they can do networking

250
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,380
on but GPRS is what t-mobile has and 118

251
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">t has and that's something like that's</font>

252
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,780
also called 2.5 g and this has a bunch

253
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,189
of components like ggsn which are

254
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,110
gateway things just think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as</font>

255
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:39,210
gateways on and off that their network

256
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:41,760
and in ims this thing called pcs CF

257
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,160
which is the proxy a sip proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

258
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,990
thing is the first thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hit</font>

259
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,780
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using the system and it has</font>

260
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the same network is this GPR</font>

261
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,610
signaling node and that seems like a

262
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,620
minor thing but you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out that</font>

263
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">when when you're trying to implement the</font>

264
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,810
cellular a roaming model on top of a

265
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,730
packet based network that becomes a huge

266
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,680
requirement and constraint<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

267
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,930
there's all this radio language 3g radio

268
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,510
2g radius of this gsm which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think most</font>

269
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,040
of us know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about there's you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TMS and</font>

270
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,830
there's you train these are kind of

271
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,079
what's coming after gsm and so what is

272
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,310
all that stuff about so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tried to make</font>

273
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">a graphic of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if this</font>

274
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:23,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to work or not but does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

275
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,949
work no can anybody read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the</font>

276
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,510
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at is uh this is</font>

277
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,200
sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete thing but the</font>

278
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,960
important things are in 2.5 g + 3g<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

279
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,750
data rates are sort of we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of miss</font>

280
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data rates in both cases so it's</font>

281
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,740
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about as to why that</font>

282
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,450
might have been so 3g was supposed to

283
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,620
have up to you know 2 megabits and its

284
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:49,260
really got something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 64 k right now</font>

285
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,880
so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean for the rest of the</font>

286
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless landscape well it's kind of</font>

287
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,710
like this the 802 11 stuff on the low

288
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,449
end sort of line stuff with 2g 2.5 g +

289
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,830
3g and then above that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

290
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,690
anything

291
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,010
that's really being standardized in that

292
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:09,030
in the voice on the on the cellular side

293
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">although there is I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

294
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,439
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture but there's a you a</font>

295
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:17,130
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> growing standard called um a</font>

296
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,870
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voiceover 802 11 so</font>

297
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,390
let's get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I ms is so that's a</font>

298
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,950
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about a quick view of what's</font>

299
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,170
going on out there in the phone world

300
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,520
and it's it's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously there's</font>

301
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,930
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of stuff going on but I'm trying</font>

302
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff that's going to</font>

303
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:33,479
impact us so there's some major features

304
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,350
in here first off you know it's

305
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,180
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the wireless</font>

306
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,170
networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are all transported on</font>

307
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,000
on on terrestrial networks are usually

308
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,380
called public land mobile network it's

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that the networks mobile but it's</font>

310
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,070
providing that transport for the mobile

311
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,550
pieces of the cell system and that's

312
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">called a plmn and you'll hear that a lot</font>

313
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's divided into core and access</font>

314
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,860
networks like every<font color="#E5E5E5"> network I must and</font>

315
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,960
the access network is generally the

316
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">radio the you know the radio area</font>

317
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:05,040
network stuff which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not really much</font>

318
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:07,170
in art of our concern generally and then

319
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,490
the circuit the circuit cornet work has

320
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,530
a circuit-switched part and a

321
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,790
packet-switched part in ims so this is

322
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,420
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> their architecture works well the</font>

323
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,300
interesting thing is legacy voice which

324
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all voice really is circuit is still</font>

325
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,459
in the circuits which part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

326
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,930
network and i'll show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how that works</font>

327
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,110
which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a surprise because</font>

328
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,120
you'd think that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building an</font>

329
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,960
IP multimedia subsystem that you would

330
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,430
do voice over IP on on voice well

331
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,410
there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that too but</font>

332
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically I ms is all day is all the</font>

333
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,449
core network elements so it's kind of

334
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a services control playing some</font>

335
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:44,190
kind of policy engine and some kind of

336
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,740
triple-a and generally the services

337
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:50,430
control point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all sip based and the</font>

338
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,260
policy is either cops these are these

339
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,620
are protocols developed in the IETF and

340
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,960
or soap beat and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that cops is I</font>

341
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,090
think 3gpp just met last week and i'm

342
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,830
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the status of cops is does</font>

343
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,390
anybody happen to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

344
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,240
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gotten downgraded as a</font>

345
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:10,590
possible policy language and then radius

346
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,380
and diameter or in play for<font color="#CCCCCC"> triple a guy</font>

347
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss also gets these domain ideas</font>

348
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,950
lined up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way</font>

349
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,690
so there's a circuit-switched domain

350
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,430
which really is the circuit network

351
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,720
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet-switched domain which</font>

352
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,449
is really kind of the internet like

353
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,870
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and then the IMS part of it</font>

354
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,640
provides policy services control plane

355
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:34,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple A so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of what it</font>

356
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:37,250
looks like and 3gpp is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really where I ms</font>

357
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,960
is going to if it if it does fly where

358
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,290
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fly so kinda looks like</font>

359
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,020
this so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some underlying models</font>

360
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,819
here too first off is walled garden

361
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Isetta is that a term familiar to people</font>

362
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,790
I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really familiar with that term</font>

363
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,790
anybody heard that term before<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

364
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:58,250
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a business model term but</font>

365
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,439
the whole idea here is that carriers are

366
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,690
trying to avoid what might be termed a

367
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,400
bit pipe syndrome where they have where

368
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,650
they were transport in you know that

369
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,819
perceived commoditization of transport

370
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,709
by the way if somebody could figure out

371
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,130
how to make a good living on transport

372
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:15,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be big um it has some other</font>

373
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:18,290
things every sip packet in this in this

374
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,780
thing is inspected by at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

375
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,910
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> see SCF devices which is I don't</font>

376
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if I have that here but yes it's</font>

377
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,260
not exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of as the</font>

378
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-to-end principle and you got to</font>

379
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of storage</font>

380
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,959
maintenance state might be required<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

381
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,380
actually do this for every for every

382
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,790
session in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire Internet so</font>

383
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,890
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> holy grail out there too which</font>

384
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,870
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know one platform many services</font>

385
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,630
so IMS would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be thought of</font>

386
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,670
as a platform that people could launch

387
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:50,210
all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of services on like presents</font>

388
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:54,140
availability push to push to talk over

389
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:58,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">cellular's being called POC i guess p PT</font>

390
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:00,280
PTT was taken some push 2 x's out there

391
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,280
to where<font color="#E5E5E5"> x is you know show voicemail</font>

392
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,230
peer-to-peer stuff instant messaging and

393
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,380
eventually all this wireless wireline

394
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:12,680
integration so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that mean</font>

395
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,360
Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual mode do people know what</font>

396
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,949
dual-mode voice is supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be this</font>

397
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,300
is the idea where<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have i have a</font>

398
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:22,070
phone that's say quad-band<font color="#E5E5E5"> gsm and 802</font>

399
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,420
11 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could just walk around and it</font>

400
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,850
works and takes the best connectivity

401
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,510
wherever I am so if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

402
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:34,160
together so if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this together</font>

403
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,269
the kind of schematic view of this is um

404
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,100
there's a circuit-switched domain as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

405
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,470
was saying so you have this radio area

406
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,690
network here<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this will work so the</font>

407
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,310
radio area network stuff is right here

408
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's like just an access network</font>

409
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,510
it just happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be radio area voice</font>

410
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,550
legacy voice which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all voice right</font>

411
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,779
now goes this way and it's all circuits

412
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,040
which this the old circuit switched

413
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,689
infrastructure and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just dump</font>

414
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,480
it onto the PSTN wherever they do and

415
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,220
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet networking</font>

416
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,779
thats related to what we do is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

417
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,769
happen all in here and so it's all

418
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:06,209
controlled over here by<font color="#E5E5E5"> ims so the idea</font>

419
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:09,709
is that you have this subsystem that's

420
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:12,060
controlling all of this stuff and

421
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:16,589
mediating every connection in this so

422
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:20,430
let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they might do that so</font>

423
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:21,870
here's the problem anybody ever seen any

424
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,130
pictures that come out of luck I to you

425
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,300
before it's kind of interesting they

426
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:29,160
they they build architectures and those

427
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,540
of us who have come from the IETF we

428
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,339
really don't build architectures we

429
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,170
build components that can be used for

430
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,910
architectures so these are a little

431
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,370
these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pictures</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a little bit</font>

432
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,910
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar to us but what I will</font>

433
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out is that they all of the boxes</font>

434
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,540
get called out and all of these are

435
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,430
functional entities in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture</font>

436
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then every interface is defined and</font>

437
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,899
has certain properties by the way one of

438
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,399
the reasons why voice is still

439
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,620
circuit-switched is because this

440
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,620
interface well if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here I</font>

441
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,959
know what's called maybe you you or um

442
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,519
those interfaces aren't efficient for

443
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,339
packet transport a voice right now

444
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they were designed before them</font>

445
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,448
so what you wind up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is this you</font>

446
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,129
know it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

447
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,510
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh okay I see how this works but</font>

448
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,720
what you wind up is a pretty complicated

449
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">system well some people do and some</font>

450
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,689
people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go okay I</font>

451
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,209
know how that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell you how all</font>

452
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:23,040
the signaling works but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

453
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,140
these are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all sip slug</font>

454
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,549
signaling paths in here so you know

455
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,390
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of signaling that has to</font>

456
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:33,320
go on to make this happen and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

457
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,910
that be a whole day in and of itself

458
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,550
Sam ok that was the architecture of you

459
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that architecture and</font>

460
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,540
you know it's it you know to really

461
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,830
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would take all of us a</font>

462
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,090
long time or at least it took me a long

463
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">time and I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really fully</font>

464
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,129
understand it but what I did do was when

465
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,739
I was looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it I realized it makes</font>

466
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,900
some assumptions that make the ability

467
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,000
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simpler it has it has a</font>

468
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,590
certain kind of irreducible complexity

469
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,390
if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement this model</font>

470
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,490
and this is what i want to do folks to

471
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,020
really look at and think about so if you

472
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,120
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this coming down the coming down</font>

473
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,320
from wherever it might come down from in

474
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,560
your organization that you could ask

475
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,720
some questions about it and so it kind

476
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,020
of it kind of has these three aspects

477
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,180
that can't be really simplified if you

478
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,610
want to implement a model<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

479
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,380
is roaming and it has actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

480
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,510
roaming model as the cellular system

481
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,530
does but we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that in a</font>

482
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,510
second but that means something

483
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">different for us in the packet</font>

484
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,980
networking than it did in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font>

485
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,190
wireless world before this it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> perc</font>

486
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,080
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> key OS which is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

487
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we've kind of rejected or at least</font>

488
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,939
rejected in in some ways quite a while

489
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago and then it has this coupling of</font>

490
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,090
higher layer services and packet

491
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,310
transport just like the cellular system

492
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:52,070
does so we'll look at each one of these

493
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:56,030
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit i'm not going to hurry up</font>

494
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:58,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so what is roaming in ims well</font>

495
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:01,440
basically you're roaming if you're using

496
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,270
packet networking network resources and

497
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,510
not circuit-switched resources but

498
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,160
packet network research resources in the

499
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:11,610
network you're visiting to connect to

500
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,070
your ims at your home so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

501
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,979
that you start roaming when you're using

502
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:20,399
any packet networking resources in the

503
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,230
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're roaming on and that</font>

504
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,940
implies<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is important that this</font>

505
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:28,200
proxy CFCF thing and the GSG GSN which

506
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,130
is sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateway to the internet</font>

507
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,420
thing can only those two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things can be</font>

508
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,370
in the visited network that you're busy

509
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,920
that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's a big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> constraint on</font>

510
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:40,409
the whole system and it also means that

511
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it also means that the subscriber so you</font>

512
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,190
know you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about how this</font>

513
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">might work you you fire up your phone</font>

514
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,880
and

515
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,860
want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the web well you have to</font>

516
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,710
send some sip signaling through this

517
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,139
through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcs CF and all of this</font>

518
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,850
stuff back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your home network which</font>

519
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,410
then triggers all the policy stuff and

520
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:00,909
that gets installed in the whole network

521
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:03,340
on the way back so there's also well

522
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:07,300
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this is kind of a another</font>

523
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:09,730
thing I ms invented well actually 3gpp

524
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,919
invented their own form of mobile IP and

525
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,440
it's called the GPRS tunneling protocol

526
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,380
and enough said they have their own they

527
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,220
have their own mobile IP and then

528
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,460
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called inner</font>

529
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">interworking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which where to two of these</font>

530
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,990
ims networks are interconnected by

531
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,780
another one and the other one enables

532
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,570
control the control plane to work and

533
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,590
the transport of the user data plan so

534
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:38,379
the picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of winds up looking</font>

535
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:40,060
like this um a is kind of roaming um um

536
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,300
actually I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture is better</font>

537
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,919
to show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically all services</font>

538
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,889
in ims you get from your home network

539
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,420
even when you're roaming so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bane the</font>

540
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,220
main point here is that even when you're

541
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,380
roaming you have to go find<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home</font>

542
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,910
network your home network<font color="#CCCCCC"> guest install</font>

543
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,640
policy and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back through</font>

544
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,830
your hole through the whole data plane

545
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,110
which actually is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the control plane back</font>

546
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,909
to actually has to follow the control

547
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,219
plane back to wherever you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at so it</font>

548
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:09,250
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of complexity here in just</font>

549
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the roaming picture but if you if you</font>

550
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,160
want to break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down to something a</font>

551
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,270
little easier which I did because I

552
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,300
couldn't really understand it for a

553
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,310
while is that they're basically that the

554
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,250
subscriber binding<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to the home</font>

555
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,560
service network which requires that the

556
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,090
providers mediates them roaming in other

557
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,770
words everybody has to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you</font>

558
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,970
are right like if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to if you take</font>

559
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop and walk over your</font>

560
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,960
neighbor's house and eat and sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

561
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,760
their wireless and dhcp an address

562
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only state in the network</font>

563
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,690
that's there not everybody along the

564
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,570
path from your neighbor's house to

565
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,310
wherever you are well this this requires

566
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,909
that everybody in the path for from your

567
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:47,500
neighbor's house knows where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

568
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:50,320
what it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that they're there</font>

569
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,810
the scheme really requires six parties

570
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,790
to coordinate this is just to get a

571
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,020
connection up so data can flow and there

572
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,870
has to be at least three billing and

573
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,570
accounting relations

574
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,010
and all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all of them have to be</font>

575
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">tracked in the control plane the data</font>

576
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,970
playing on the management play now you

577
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,320
got to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because that</font>

578
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,180
that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean just within your</font>

579
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,730
network I mean you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that has</font>

580
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,559
to happen across wherever whatever

581
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,150
appearing turns out to be for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

582
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,879
wherever the settlements are the are

583
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,590
resolved in this that has to live across

584
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,620
that I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what those are which</font>

585
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,300
are they well let's see so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

586
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">that for a second six parties to roaming</font>

587
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,990
well obviously wherever the sender is

588
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,700
the person who's sending has to be

589
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved the person who's receiving has</font>

590
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,970
to be involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home service provider</font>

591
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,400
of a remember that's where all the

592
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,030
policy and everything comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

593
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,220
home service provider be likewise

594
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:43,160
whatever provider the sender's currently

595
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,050
roamed on and whatever provider the

596
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,400
receivers currently Rome done all those

597
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,770
things have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be tracked through the</font>

598
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">control plane of the thing accounting</font>

599
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,889
and building relationships well the

600
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,720
sender with is home for provider

601
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,790
obviously that's the commercial system

602
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,110
on the receiver with its own from

603
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,409
provider again that's the commercial

604
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,850
system the provider of a with the home

605
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,190
provider be right to sender and

606
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,480
receivers if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to implement</font>

607
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,410
things like clothes groups like the

608
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,530
phone guys like to do the home provider

609
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:15,140
of the sender with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the provider</font>

610
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,309
that the sender's roamed on I mean

611
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,350
there's this has to be a roaming

612
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,990
agreement between those two and finally

613
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:23,600
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last one but the</font>

614
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,070
roaming agreement for the receiver so if

615
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about that all of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

616
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:31,370
has got to be tracked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control</font>

617
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:33,350
plane of of the end-to-end connection

618
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,300
state of the network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a lot of</font>

619
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,250
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't really do that right</font>

620
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,629
now so the key takeaway<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all of this</font>

621
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,980
is that if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement this</font>

622
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,690
roaming model that's sort of an

623
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:46,130
irreducible piece of complexity and

624
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,570
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just no way to get around it so</font>

625
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,480
the other one the other one what's next

626
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,540
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're two more so IMS has this</font>

627
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,570
per session QoS model and we went around

628
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:59,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that per session qos superfluous quite a</font>

629
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:02,210
bit when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first came into the IETF well</font>

630
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,800
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone guys do have procession</font>

631
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">QSR because they have a circuit-switched</font>

632
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,678
Network they want to have the same per

633
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,259
session qos in this

634
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,820
work and it turns out that the policy

635
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:14,590
has to be mediated by every service

636
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,658
provider who has in the county building

637
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:18,879
relationship on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling path and</font>

638
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:20,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data has to convey constraint is</font>

639
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:22,178
constrained to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow that same</font>

640
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:23,408
signaling path and that's a major source

641
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:24,669
of complexity if you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

642
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:28,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'd have to do to maintain that in</font>

643
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:31,090
your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> combine that</font>

644
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:34,779
with the roaming model you get something

645
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,879
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated and really the</font>

646
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:38,710
desire here is to replicate the billing

647
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:40,509
behavior of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PSTN friend and flows</font>

648
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,559
right because when you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a phone when</font>

649
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:43,690
you put up a phone call it's an

650
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-to-end flowering same thing so the</font>

651
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,690
system has to simultaneously enforce

652
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:51,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">three and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> variants to make that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

653
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:53,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">what are they well let's see and you got</font>

654
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this because where does</font>

655
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,100
the state for this reside remember how

656
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,289
much work we've done to keep our core

657
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stateless and or minimize that</font>

658
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,100
or is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this stuff after his</font>

659
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">eye</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay first off the destination</font>

660
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,230
subscriber is not alerted unless the<font color="#CCCCCC"> QSR</font>

661
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,970
are available for the call right for

662
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,519
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is well that's like</font>

663
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,809
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if I pick up my phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

664
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:18,009
can't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a phone call i'm not going to</font>

665
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:19,658
ring your phone anyway you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

666
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:21,070
billed until the destination subscriber

667
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:22,600
answers well that's kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

668
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,840
phone system<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write you don't you</font>

669
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,580
don't get billed for that and qos can't

670
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,110
be obtained on the transmitted data

671
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:33,549
until billing starts now what does this

672
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:35,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">all mean well the real thing is that if</font>

673
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:37,929
you just leave the state aside for a

674
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,850
second it requires this commit<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserve</font>

675
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:41,409
commit phasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in signaling which we</font>

676
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,908
don't have either you know we're working

677
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:44,139
on single site is signaling and things

678
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:46,749
like that to reduce this kind of

679
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:49,779
dependency this is putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a heavy heavy</font>

680
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:54,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">reserve commit phasing requirement on on</font>

681
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:57,669
the signaling and it also um it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

682
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,919
well let's just put this way there's

683
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:01,659
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of extensions to sip made to</font>

684
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,279
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this happen or make it easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

685
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:08,350
have it happen so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

686
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:11,889
operational complexity here so it's

687
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:13,269
two-sided signaling right and the

688
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:16,389
picture is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really complicated by the</font>

689
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:17,679
fact that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> services which is really</font>

690
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:19,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of volume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ass right it's to</font>

691
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,060
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build a service creation</font>

692
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,040
platform the services that are there

693
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,899
really exacerbate the situation like

694
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,560
toll free reverse charge and prepaid

695
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,910
that's really tough to do and again the

696
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,169
point of this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of awareness raising</font>

697
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,370
thing is just think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you'd</font>

698
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:38,050
have to do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network to support</font>

699
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of state well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing ok so</font>

700
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,649
there's another coupling thing here too

701
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,780
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third source that I could</font>

702
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,280
identify and basically what what's

703
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening with I okay five minutes okay</font>

704
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so like I'm going to talk about IMS</font>

705
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:54,070
in 20 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Simms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the worst that's</font>

706
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:55,960
trying it's worth a try so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

707
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,830
last one and and the thing here is that

708
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,940
the whole point of this is to couple

709
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,740
services to the transport layer just

710
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the cell system does it just like</font>

711
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,390
the voice system does but we have in the

712
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,770
packet world or in the IP world we've

713
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,320
done we've done all this work to do the

714
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:14,620
reverse right so specifically the

715
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,810
complexity really derives from China a

716
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:20,080
couple services billable services to the

717
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:21,850
qos and packet transport and that's

718
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,320
what's really causing this to go out of

719
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can just get</font>

720
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">through this okay well this is some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

721
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,300
the business stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what it</font>

722
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:33,010
is is there's three motivations right

723
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">levering ass leveraging assets obviously</font>

724
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,070
everybody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that cross</font>

725
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,500
subsidizing because that gives everybody

726
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,899
full price flexibility and then the

727
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,940
whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dampening you know the</font>

728
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,800
walled garden idea dampening price based

729
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,850
competition so all of this stuff is

730
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,050
encoded in in all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IMS stuff so I</font>

731
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,060
just want to show you one other picture

732
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:56,409
which because we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

733
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,820
quickly oops okay so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the kind</font>

734
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the roaming thing and then your</font>

735
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,300
network you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even be you might</font>

736
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,220
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even be involved in in any of the</font>

737
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,620
CMS stuff but all of a sudden you're

738
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,870
what's called an inner inner public land

739
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,010
mobile network and you know you're

740
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in between two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

741
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:13,510
guys doing this there's a device that

742
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,360
goes here and you could use ims

743
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,530
terminology but you could also use how

744
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">many people have heard of session border</font>

745
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:23,350
controller well that's what goes here

746
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,669
and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be stuck with session</font>

747
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,610
border controller even though you don't

748
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,710
have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IMS so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point of this whole</font>

749
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,870
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not to give you a tutorial on</font>

750
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,210
what I ms is or how how it all works but

751
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,669
basically if you see it coming along

752
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,720
think about a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit what what your</font>

753
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,340
network is going to have to do to

754
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,160
provide to provide this kind of service

755
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,300
and what what you need to tell your

756
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,250
management about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

757
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,110
accomplish because as I said there's

758
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,300
some controversy over ims but there's a

759
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:51,129
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are implementing big</font>

760
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,280
chunks of it so I'll just leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at</font>

761
00:28:51,130 --> 00:29:03,430
that and maybe I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dump</font>

762
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:05,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">any questions too much stuff I know this</font>

763
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,090
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man I</font>

764
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,919
talk well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually love this talk this</font>

765
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a great talk for me because it seems</font>

766
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be addressing one of the problems</font>

767
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,200
that I have on my list of problems I

768
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,520
want to solve and I can tie it directly

769
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,440
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own mind but of course I don't</font>

770
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,940
speak for operators which is why this

771
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,090
might be a clueless question but your

772
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,830
conclusions aren't that um like

773
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,179
provocative can I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you is this</font>

774
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,320
going to work do you think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font>

775
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,550
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work so okay is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean is that</font>

776
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,750
the audience like I always do and blame

777
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,820
them for the right that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair</font>

778
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:36,100
question no that's a fair question um I

779
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,510
tried to I tried to not be too

780
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,490
provocative because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

781
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,850
controversy around IMS and I wanted

782
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to form on their own opinions I</font>

783
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,610
wanted to kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see if I couldn't</font>

784
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">distill out what I thought were the</font>

785
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,570
aspects of ims that we're going to clash

786
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:54,969
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Protocol our model and</font>

787
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,970
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want my my gut feeling about</font>

788
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,970
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this is going to work</font>

789
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:03,870
it's I can a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask me that</font>

790
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:06,520
that's the first thing and I I think

791
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,989
like my level once said i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is that</font>

792
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know if you put enough horsepower</font>

793
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,530
behind it some piece of it will work

794
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,390
whether or not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to deliver</font>

795
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,639
what people really want which is you

796
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,410
know holy grail i got a service creation

797
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,330
platform that i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build any kind of</font>

798
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,400
service rapidly on that lowers my optics

799
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:25,000
and capex I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so but that's</font>

800
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,500
not just my opinion so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just give</font>

801
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,930
the audience the benefit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years of</font>

802
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Reese work on qos in the research</font>

803
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,680
community to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to accomplish the same</font>

804
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:36,040
stuff which is that we've abject<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee</font>

805
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,420
failed and we freely admit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even you</font>

806
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,700
know the leaders of the community I

807
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain qf but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before i watch all</font>

808
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,400
the shaking heads I understand Cisco's

809
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,680
got qos working in enterprise networks

810
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,310
and all that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d</font>

811
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,780
legitimize the benefit that but energy

812
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,610
u.s. is what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing is about</font>

813
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,580
right among among other functionality

814
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,229
and so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this is exactly</font>

815
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,000
what I hope that community is talking

816
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,200
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the reason that the research</font>

817
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,850
community failed to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything useful</font>

818
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inter domain qos is because we</font>

819
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:03,110
basically completely ignore the the

820
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,689
problems that are at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root of qos</font>

821
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:09,530
with inner domain qos which is economics

822
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:11,270
ownership and trust and I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

823
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,379
how this is addressing those problems so

824
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,730
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wrong about that because</font>

825
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,650
I'd love to see those problems address

826
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,240
but I wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if you guys think</font>

827
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,930
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> roots that we've figured out on</font>

828
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:23,540
the same roots yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it's</font>

829
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:26,020
explicitly addressed in the MS work

830
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,190
because they ended up just just

831
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,350
addressing the interdomain thing right

832
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,330
now the interdomain qos thing seems to

833
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,530
be fairly has come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font>

834
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,850
you're aware of this but I mean it's

835
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,950
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of activity around</font>

836
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:41,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain qos right now just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

837
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:45,500
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of activity around inter</font>

838
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:47,480
domain and pls stuff right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

839
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">know i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's being kind of looked</font>

840
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,510
at again but not by the 3gpp people who

841
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:55,490
are building us so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as the</font>

842
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:58,190
interdomain piece of this goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i agree</font>

843
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:02,000
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you said um but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

844
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:03,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it will fail before</font>

845
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,570
that in some ways is what I'm trying to

846
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,360
say great you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think</font>

847
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's there's weak links that that</font>

848
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,219
will reach before we get to that part

849
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:15,800
the human factors part about not being

850
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,670

the different things that will have to

853
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,470
which some you made an off-the-cuff

854
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,940
comment about how it'd be nice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

855
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,530
could figure out how to do packet

856
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,130
transport in a profitable<font color="#CCCCCC"> way another</font>

857
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:29,180
make a living at it and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish I</font>

858
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">knew more about this but I don't know</font>

859
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,120
any provider that says that backbone

860
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,040
transport is profitable right now so

861
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,379
this is sort of just putting that

862
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,510
question under the rug right or are they

863
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,100
opening up to that problem no I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

864
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,379
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everybody's aware of</font>

865
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,110
that problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think I a mess is</font>

866
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,700
sort of a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that because the</font>

867
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,350
normal response to that that we've seen

868
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,670
is go up stack because there's no Reb

869
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,679
there's more revenue there with better

870
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:53,900
margin right but doesn't make the lower

871
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,670
part profitable or just it's a loss

872
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,440
leader now it's yeah

873
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you know it does a great job thank</font>

874
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,720
you what so to disagree of it with you

875
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:06,169
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> firstly okay so you disagree with</font>

876
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,470
but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you okay first with Casey I think</font>

877
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:11,270
inter provider inter provider qos works

878
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,820
great today it just doesn't work

879
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:16,040
internet whined so there are plenty of

880
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,200
providers and have be directional

881
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,530
relationships where they have private

interconnects with their<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed upon POS</font>

883
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:33,440
it's working<font color="#CCCCCC"> its employed so so internet</font>

884
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,820
wide it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not a goal even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

885
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you have to define what internet</font>

886
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,220
wide means as well because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:43,220
that's where this is it has it is

900
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:19,130
do is try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to make it</font>

901
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:22,040
work not so much question ourselves you

902
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,860
know is it going to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think if</font>

903
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,989
there's a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive our job should</font>

904
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,360
be to try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance</font>

905
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:32,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the per session kill was if you</font>

906
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">encapsulated in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a core in terms of</font>

907
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,470
trunks which is what the ATM guys and

908
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:39,560
the phone guys have always done across

909
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:43,909
the years<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean you can make her float</font>

910
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:47,918
us work simply by using wiring and learn

911
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:52,370
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with what to ATM types did</font>

912
00:34:47,918 --> 00:35:00,350
your comparison regarding that the

913
00:34:52,370 --> 00:35:03,049
roaming stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean IP IP VIP mobile IP</font>

914
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:05,180
model also uses home agents foreign

915
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,040
agents so if you did the one-to-one

916
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,770
comparison

917
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:11,170
you'd have the same thing so from your

918
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:15,100
complexity and I was not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

919
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,480
really what you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> too sweet yeah</font>

920
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,610
we could get into but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

921
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,110
the same set from the complaint point

922
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:23,980
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just make a point is the point I</font>

923
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:26,140
was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Susan am i</font>

924
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,220
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the point I was trying</font>

925
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make there and I probably didn't make</font>

926
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,910
it clearly is that you could do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

927
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,650
two ways right you could say all right I

928
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,660
have a packet network and what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

929
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,700
to do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to build services on</font>

930
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,649
top of a packet network and build

931
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,629
applications that are packet network

932
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,220
aware or you could say I have a packet

933
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,200
network and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to make the</font>

934
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,209
infrastructure I had run over that and

935
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,100
see that's what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ladder is what I ms</font>

936
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,350
is doing and in fact it's doing it at a

937
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,970
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> another level which is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

938
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,950
circuit infrastructure that people are

939
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,419
are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the circuits which</font>

940
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,189
domain of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this which was the circuit</font>

941
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,990
infrastructure they had before the PSTN

942
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,790
infrastructure that they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> before what</font>

943
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,529
the what folks are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to wanting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

944
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,620
do is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay that all over some pseudo</font>

945
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,630
wires and then lay ims on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

946
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,900
none of their operational infrastructure

947
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:14,770
has to change so it's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font>

948
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:17,620
than just ims you can more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you need</font>

949
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:19,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">modern on I think the best thing we</font>

950
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,640
could do as a community would be instead

951
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,040
of asking ourselves is going to work

952
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,950
sort of ask ourselves what should our

953
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,680
contribution be so it works better don't

954
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:33,000
you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly last time I you</font>

955
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:38,169
know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago people were talking</font>

956
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,090
ol3 PPN l2vpn services on top of IP

957
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,620
networks and a bit of reaction of the

958
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:45,100
community was saying oh it will never

959
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:46,420
work it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> working yeah so I think it</font>

960
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:50,589
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good not to repeat the same</font>

961
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:52,390
mistake yeah definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah i think i</font>

962
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,090
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the complexity analysis i wanted</font>

963
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,799
to special get you in a second okay yeah

964
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,660
the complexity analysis was supposed to

965
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,220
be something was supposed to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

966
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,350
something like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do this</font>

967
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,930
and you want to make it work you got to

968
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:06,370
pay this price not that it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work or</font>

969
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,140
won't work but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an</font>

970
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:10,299
irreducible amount of stuff in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

971
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,220
you can't get below that especially and

972
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,040
the roaming model one is the one that

973
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">really comes home easily so that's kind</font>

974
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,810
of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say there go</font>

975
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,360
ahead Spencer uh yeah Dave how

976
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:25,000
went to thank you for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

977
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,740
talk it was very helpful and I think a

978
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,540
dovetail very well with what you talked

979
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,779
about on sunday afternoon about

980
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:34,120
complexity can I back you up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like</font>

981
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:37,180
your last picture that had the you are

982
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:43,750
here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top basically between my</font>

983
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:46,060
laptop I do it ok I like I like magic

984
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:51,280
point but it you know it has its it has

985
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:54,640
its quirky things oh no I did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

986
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes yeah that one there so so basically</font>

987
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,390
I two questions one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

988
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,300
clarification or you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

989
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:05,020
that even if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room are</font>

990
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:08,410
ending up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I guess the second top</font>

991
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:13,509
the second box from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top yeah that</font>

992
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:15,069
that with with the / flow qos that I ms

993
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,900
is talking about that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

994
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to be have some awareness that</font>

995
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,670
they're transporting that stuff it's

996
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,109
it's possible yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's that was</font>

997
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,810
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the red flag on that one</font>

998
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:28,480
exactly the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to</font>

999
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention is you know you talked a little</font>

1000
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,940
bit about session border controllers and

1001
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,859
I think there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a huge number of</font>

1002
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,890
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the community doesn't have a</font>

1003
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,630
clue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean the specification</font>

1004
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,450
community doesn't have a strong

1005
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,460
understanding of at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point with svcs</font>

1006
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:50,560
one of the things was we're doing a lot

1007
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:53,290
with voice qos again voice over IP with

1008
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,870
the mean opinion scores and things like

1009
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,880
that which is working<font color="#CCCCCC"> fairly decently</font>

1010
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,910
because everybody's dumping all their

1011
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,950
voice over IP traffic onto the onto<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1012
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,779
circuit switched network at the edge of

1013
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,609
their network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1014
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you'll stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> packet switched all</font>

1015
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:12,820
the way yeah through this as in so

1016
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:14,980
basically if you're terminating the bear

1017
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,340
traffic two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three points you could</font>

1018
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:22,810
have acceptable our scores on every leg

1019
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:25,330
but not you know I so must I go yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1020
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:27,130
mean are factored in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moss course on</font>

1021
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,110
every leg but but still not have

1022
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,600
something that works for the customer in

1023
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end and nobody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really has visibility</font>

1024
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,750
to that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1025
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,130
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in this picture you're</font>

1026
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,540
talking about potentially three

1027
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,460
completely different networks with three

1028
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,020
different administrators yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean how</font>

1029
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,840
many networks do your packets go through

1030
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">between any two points</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right there's</font>

1031
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,010
somebody over there can we take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1032
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,610
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd also like to thank you for the</font>

1033
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:52,770
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it really helps to</font>

1034
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:53,940
to point out to people that there are

1035
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,820
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen that are too</font>

1036
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,970
complex and I think that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look at</font>

1037
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,460
this also as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what is the goal</font>

1038
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,819
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network is it to you know make</font>

1039
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,920
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that old companies can continue to</font>

1040
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,570
make the same kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of profits or is it</font>

1041
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,630
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that people have content</font>

1042
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,730
and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the benefits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1043
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:22,230
internet does this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of network is</font>

1044
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:25,500
really an anti internet and it breaks

1045
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,910
the end and<font color="#E5E5E5"> principles it's also from an</font>

1046
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,980
implementation point of view it's kind

1047
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:33,359
of like ATM cubed or something and I

1048
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:36,210
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what people might want to</font>

1049
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,580
look at is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept of the paradox of</font>

1050
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:41,160
the best network because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

1051
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what we're fighting with is if</font>

1052
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,649
the issue is that bit transport doesn't

1053
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,029
pay we need to figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way that we</font>

1054
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:54,410
can still transport bits and people can

1055
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:59,010
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at net paradox calm to see more</font>

1056
00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion about that thanks Travis Dave</font>

1057
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:03,990
thanks pal um one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1058
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:07,200
clarified<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that ims is not totally</font>

1059
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:13,680
finalized yet it's still like a moving

1060
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:15,330
target yeah yeah yeah so no<font color="#E5E5E5"> but people</font>

1061
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,980
are making products for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and drink you</font>

1062
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:19,170
sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to us yeah and there's several</font>

1063
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">pre pre standard deployments that are so</font>

1064
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:24,720
network operators really have to involve

1065
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,689
now before we get this imposed on us by

1066
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,520
unfortunately someone who has an idea

1067
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,610
that the ss7 network should be imposed

1068
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so a lot of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1069
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:37,590
yeah so I didn't it's good point Travis

1070
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,270
I didn't put my you know my final slide

1071
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:42,450
from my other talk which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of kind</font>

1072
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of trying to get folks to come out to</font>

1073
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,470
the standards organizations SDS

1074
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,579
whichever one you lie

1075
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,500
because these people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> building this</font>

1076
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:51,410
stuff and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to affect you and</font>

1077
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,930
your the folks who have the real

1078
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:57,089
requirements so any way that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1079
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:00,779
more operator participation in either

1080
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:02,609
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF itu wherever so rather than</font>

1081
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,040
just consuming these standards let's try

1082
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:07,529
to set them because something like this

1083
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,529
with so many moving parts with so many

1084
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:14,390
interdependencies does<font color="#E5E5E5"> really anybody</font>

1085
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,390
here want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to their network</font>

1086
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:23,430
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave I want to thank you for thanks</font>

1087
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:26,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you um yeah I actually had</font>

1088
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:29,879
one technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you yeah um the</font>

1089
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:32,130
question is have you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do they</font>

1090
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,839
have good examples of trying to strip

1091
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,569
down some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the functionality of the</font>

1092
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,599
procession<font color="#CCCCCC"> QSR do they have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have all</font>

1093
00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:41,069
or can<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in order</font>

1094
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make their billing in their callback</font>

1095
00:42:41,069 --> 00:42:47,069
stuff work so um because complexity

1096
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:49,440
reduces if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that definitely</font>

1097
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:52,230
there's there's several priests standard

1098
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,020
deployments and they use different

1099
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,549
infrastructure to accomplish pieces of

1100
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,869
the same thing so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to that is</font>

1101
00:42:56,549 --> 00:43:04,710
yes but they aren't ims there are pretty

1102
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:07,200
standard kind of policy control planes

1103
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,210
would you be<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to post or give us</font>

1104
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,569
some examples or some further on about

1105
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:16,130
drug that that that subsection sure i'd

1106
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:16,130
be interested at least thank you again
