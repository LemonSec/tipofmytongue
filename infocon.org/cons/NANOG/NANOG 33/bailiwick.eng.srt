there'll be another question behind me

286
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:05,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank for the presentation my name is</font>

287
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ed Louis I work for a new star I've been</font>

288
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">I worked in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dina's for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a while and</font>

289
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,710
I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a couple</font>

290
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:15,470
places it's a fairly big problem because

291
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:18,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS protocol can screw itself up and</font>

292
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,150
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one example of how it happens</font>

293
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,649
what I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up here and</font>

294
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,260
say is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end you talked about the</font>

295
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,410
IETF and nanog and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion back</font>

296
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,060
and forth this is a case where people in

297
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,470
the operator community really need to

298
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,690
pay attention with the ITF is saying

299
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these kind of issues because on</font>

300
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,980
the one hand we're working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

301
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,660
protocol and trying to extend it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

302
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,570
cleaning things up like cleaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this</font>

303
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,650
glue situation here we've created

304
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,740
operational issues for the operational

305
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,880
community as protocol engineer it's

306
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,590
urgent to come over to the operations

307
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,740
side and see the impacts of these

308
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,919
cleaned up protocols in this case part

309
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,570
of it is implementations in the past

310
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,310
haven't done the exact right job all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

311
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,860
way through there for example in bind

312
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight we know that it gets lost trying</font>

313
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,419
to find answers and that's what's

314
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:08,899
happening and by nine they fixed how

315
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,490
they look for stuff so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a case</font>

316
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,230
where implementations have gotten better

317
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,260
that's why eight to nine is getting

318
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,730
better for this but continually in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

319
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,470
operational community when things like

320
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,270
this happen it's important that people

321
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,070
look at things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen for example</font>

322
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,650
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IAF's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns operations working</font>

323
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,899
group dns up where these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

324
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,550
discussions will really help go back to

325
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the protocol engine say we have to</font>

326
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">improve things they are too</font>

327
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:43,860
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your comments oh we</font>

328
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:47,760
totally agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their ideas um</font>

329
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,740
Spencer Dawkins and you mentioned that

330
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,200
one of the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were saying was</font>

331
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:57,240
when we were when you were looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> e</font>

332
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">160 for DARPA and this is maybe as much</font>

333
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,920
for the people in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> is anybody</font>

334
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:06,720
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> but North America number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eplan</font>

335
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,990
country code wine has not been delegated

336
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,800
yet for e.164 ARPA but that's actually

337
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,930
supposed to happen in like january 2006

338
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,510
so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may be affecting</font>

339
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:20,550
people in the room a lot more in the

340
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:29,810
coming year then then they're thinking

341
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:29,810
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>
