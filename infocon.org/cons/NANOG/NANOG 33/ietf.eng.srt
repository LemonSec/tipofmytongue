1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
so um as Susan said I'm here to give you

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,929
a bit of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> update on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the administrative</font>

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,259
restructuring side of the IETF work um

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:16,590
and you might say restructuring what

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,850
again still and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,640
some percentage of you have already

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,720
heard all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this about the</font>

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,300
restructuring work being done over at

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the IETF in which case you've now got</font>

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,840
some time for guilt free reading a vmail

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,430
my purpose here today is largely just to

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,500
make sure that you've heard bits and

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,290
pieces enough to wonder what the heck<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,469
going on over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on the IETF it this</font>

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,700
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you some actual facts and</font>

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,600
description<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so that you'll know</font>

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's not really a whole lot of a</font>

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,350
revolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in the ITF it really</font>

19
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,860
is about evolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's taking care</font>

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,710
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and as far as bringing it up</font>

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,800
here Susan hair hairs<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me to come</font>

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">and give a bit of an update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this in</font>

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,009
part because well it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and</font>

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,650
we are all in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> together so the IETF</font>

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,840
doesn't exist there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some that think</font>

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a loose legal fabric</font>

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,960
surrounding it Ted Hardy refers to it as

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,090
a massive collective delusion but the

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,530
fact is that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't an organization</font>

30
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,360
that does not have members does not have

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,470
a head office is not actually capable

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,210
signing any agreements on its own behalf

33
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,860
nevertheless for decades it has been the

34
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,658
organization of choice for developing

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,079
and maintaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet technical</font>

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:41,220
standards so all this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been true and</font>

37
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,929
it's not changing so what do you do when

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,329
you don't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and can't sign things</font>

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,220
and don't otherwise exist well of course

40
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you do is you work with friends and</font>

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of where that joint</font>

42
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,589
collective delusion comes in you work

43
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,780
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and you share the load so</font>

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,600
over the decades some of the

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,250
organizations that have been involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,929
supporting various pieces of the IETF

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:07,190
risi CNRI in the internet society but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

48
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,489
the IETF workload grows and overall the

49
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,710
undertakings get more formalized and

50
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:16,170
need to be streamlined we need an over

51
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,660
all integration of efforts so if you

52
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,149
want to have a bit of an overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

53
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,700
some of the gory details of what happens

54
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,370
when you have the workload spread across

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,700
three or more different organizations

56
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,580
have a look at RSC 3716 which is a

57
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,140
document published I've lost track<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,500
whether was a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago or two years ago</font>

59
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">now the I the Advisory Committee report</font>

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,820
which didn't was an effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze</font>

61
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,920
the situation and put out in public some

62
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,600
of the some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> details about how the</font>

63
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,250
IETF is supported and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,040
that it is supported from money sources

65
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,100
from different places and the fact that

66
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,750
that money is collected and<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent from</font>

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:06,090
different places makes it hard to for

68
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:08,430
instance do an integration of effort or

69
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,630
money flows so for instance if you've

70
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,970
got a lot of money coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> in from</font>

71
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting fees that might mean you still</font>

72
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,790
have an RFC editor that's not properly

73
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,820
funded so specifically the requirements

74
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,500
identified in 3716 were that we should

75
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,269
formalize the control the IETF

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,860
administrative support in a new

77
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,990
organizational activity of some

78
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,850
description and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> important elements</font>

79
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the that that</font>

80
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,940
organizational activity should be

81
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">accountable to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF leadership and</font>

82
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,470
community with clear lines of

83
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,840
responsibility and<font color="#E5E5E5"> accountability that</font>

84
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,020
entity should manage financial resources

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,200
both revenue and expenses and all the

86
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,100
joys associated there too and negotiate

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,290
and administer any appropriate contracts

88
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,420
so that was the requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> phase and</font>

89
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,609
there is actually a solution proposal on

90
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,109
the table under active discussion

91
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,750
although I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty much close</font>

92
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,000
to the end of last call at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

93
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:09,780
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have a look at draft I ITF is a</font>

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">bcp I think it's in 06 now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 05</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 06</font>

95
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,280
now so the proposal is to create a new

96
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">activity to anchor the administrative</font>

97
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,988
functions the IETF work and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

98
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:24,210
IETF administrative support activity I

99
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:27,630
asah so the ISO will have an oversight

100
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,909
committee literally to provide an

101
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,010
the function<font color="#CCCCCC"> of overseeing and not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

102
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:37,410
the administrative activities that's the

103
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">IAO see this I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked the thing really is</font>

104
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,580
strictly focused on the integration and

105
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:45,960
administration side of things it is not

106
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,300
replacing the existing organizations

107
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,159
that that we work with closely the RFC

108
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,840
editor the secretary or the parameter

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,980
registration functions carried out by

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:00,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ana the goal is that we will now have an</font>

111
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:02,570
anchor<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for the contracts and other</font>

112
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,920
agreements with those organizations

113
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,540
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to note that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all of</font>

114
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,370
what I'm talking about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> formally</font>

115
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:13,170
separate from the ietf standards process

116
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:16,130
which remains unchanged so the new

117
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,510
activity will support<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and and</font>

118
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,100
importantly although the oversight

119
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,860
powers of the Oversight Committee are

120
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,020
over the is a function itself the

121
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,300
administration this is not creating a

122
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">quote-unquote new top of the IETF tree</font>

123
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,020
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the top of the ITF</font>

124
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:36,330
tree is and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not trying to define</font>

125
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:39,320
it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all grand</font>

126
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,060
and wonderful but where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we now so</font>

127
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,880
recognizing that as we rolled over from

128
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,080
2004 into 2005 we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

129
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,670
relatively close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

130
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,409
process of defining what the structure

131
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,950
would be and<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have to get to the</font>

132
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,530
point of actually implementing it we we

133
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:58,440
established a transition team to help

134
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,830
define the the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationships for</font>

135
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,810
2005 and do the first critical step

136
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,240
which is finding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one employee that</font>

137
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,040
we envision the I a so we'll have which

138
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the IETF administrative director in</font>

139
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,930
terms of requirements for moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward</font>

140
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,810
we need to get full<font color="#E5E5E5"> bcp approval before</font>

141
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:22,710
we actually take any binding actions for

142
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,930
example hiring the IAD and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

143
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,180
move move as quickly as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards</font>

144
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,520
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual structure being defined</font>

145
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,740
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bcp so going from where we are to</font>

146
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,020
at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two thousand four to where</font>

147
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,850
we want to be based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that proposal and</font>

148
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,180
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the real challenges in all this</font>

149
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,790
is well there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few real challenges</font>

150
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,650
in order to maintain something create

151
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain something that will be truly</font>

152
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,820
transparent and open we're doing all

153
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,120
this in as opener processes we can

154
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly manage we are in essence trying</font>

155
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,840
to you know work on the engine of a

156
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,760
plane while it's in flight and we

157
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,320
certainly recognize that the important

158
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,270
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the IETF at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

159
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,520
day really is the work that's getting

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,169
done the people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings and participating on the</font>

162
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,790
mailing lists and actually getting

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,820
standards you know reviewed revised then

164
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,160

166
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,210
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty fundamentally</font>

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:26,310
important important namely the overall

168
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:29,789
financial flows so the rough timeline

169
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:32,130
for from where we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> now to do moving</font>

approve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vcp in early februari which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">requires I sock Board of Trustees</font>

179
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,340
approval for two reasons one because

180
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,900
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bcp and part of the ietf</font>

standards process is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ice</font>

awkward actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> does approve bcp</font>

183
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,210
documents the other is because the

184
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,640
actual proposal for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity is</font>

185
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,989
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be housed within the</font>

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,030
infinite society itself what I haven't

187
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,640
outlined in the this this presentation

188
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,140
this morning is the degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> and extent to</font>

189
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,659
which the ITF and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sock of a</font>

190
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">long-standing history there's just not</font>

191
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,920
enough time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into all the depth and</font>

192
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,289
breadth of this but if you read the

193
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,420
backing document RFC 3716 and have a

194
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,830
look at the I asset proposal they'll

195
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,240
understand that this is you know a

196
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,290
logical step forward in our relationship

197
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,810
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Isaac so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope to get approval</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">vcd and early februari we look to see</font>

199
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:47,760
the initial<font color="#E5E5E5"> ioc then in March so that we</font>

200
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,520
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> start final contract negotiations</font>

201
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,310
for 2005 and get approval hopefully in

202
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the April</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timeframe this is</font>

203
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:57,770
fairly optimistic timeline but it's easy

204
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,949
it's as easy to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimistic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

205
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,260
pessimistic and generally more pleasant

206
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and overall our hope is that contracts</font>

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">or other agreements will be in place in</font>

210

administrative restructuring process the

actual discussions are going on on the

on the main IETF discussion list ITF at

description of the IAD position that I

222
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,050
mentioned earlier and the fact that we

223
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,790
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> openly seeking applicants for that</font>

225
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,430
anyone who would be qualified there we

226
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,839
go there's the acronym soup all<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

227
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:06,319
page<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that thought</font>

228
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:09,580
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask there any questions one of the</font>

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,290
obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is now that you have</font>

230
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,150
staff that you're paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> for where will</font>

231
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,699
you find the funds<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the staff and</font>

232
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">what does that do to the financial and</font>

233
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:24,620
how will that change the financial

234
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:26,300
reporting right so the part of this

235
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,860
effort is it can be looked at as

236
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,900
something of a shell game and that we're

237
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,420
just rearranging things as opposed to

238
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,430
trying to introduce new finances into

239
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,579
the picture so a lot of this is about

240
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,370
saying instead of CNRI collecting

241
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,530
meeting fees an organization will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

242
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,780
collecting them directly on behalf of

243
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,430
the intf administration so what we're

244
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,930
doing is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying fine take the</font>

245
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,150
money that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sock has been using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

246
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">support the RFC editor take the money</font>

247
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,079
directly from meeting fees put that

248
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,790
together in one common pool and now

249
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,200
redistribute that across all the

250
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,579
administrative stuff that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

251
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,920
to do which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still have meetings</font>

252
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,430
support the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC editors for at the draft</font>

253
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,760
process support Secretariat yes and hire

254
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:11,459
the IAD

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,650
so part of the part of the equation is

256
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,450
rearranging money we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and</font>

257
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,060
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the equation is ongoing</font>

258
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,340
discussion with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sock which has been</font>

259
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,199
committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to supporting the ITF through</font>

260
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,360
the years and particularly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

261
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,010
support of the RFC editor and they have

262
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,650
stepped up to the plate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that</font>

263
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,620
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know also support with</font>

264
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:36,319
with their money shortfall that we have

265
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:39,420
in in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget so the short answer is</font>

266
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,070
more money coming via<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sock and I sighs</font>

267
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,099
of course gets most of it money its

268
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:46,650
money from corporate donations to do

269
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:57,290
itself so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give money the</font>

270
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:57,290
ITF give it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hawk thanks</font>

271
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:14,130
while Alex comes up I get in and plugs

272
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,900
in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop I get the idea I get to</font>

273
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,630
harangue him as he often does well he's

274
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:24,340
leaving the meeting Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> Susan for</font>

275
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:27,870
this turnabout so alex is my routing ad

276
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:31,180
who picks on me as a BGP co-chair to

277
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,830
send in documents so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I know this</font>

278
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,449
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an interesting update not i'll</font>

279
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:41,290
be glad to and be able to ask questions

280
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:44,290
at the end i guess i'm alex and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

281
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:47,020
going to talk about money not explicitly

282
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,699
anyways what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm</font>

283
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to give a brief update about</font>

284
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:55,800
what's happening in the routing area

285
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,510
specifically in 2004 primarily about

286
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,719
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being approved as far as</font>

287
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:05,020
standardization is concerned as well as

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,890
highlight some areas where new work is

289
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,210
started and where feedback explicitly

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:14,890
from the search provider communities

291
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:16,780
needed so some statistics so we're

currently are the routing area currently

293

consists of 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups and since</font>

294
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:25,000
2002 we concluded four working groups

295
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,430
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when we deal and I started</font>

296
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,680
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the area and kind of brushing</font>

297
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,290
it and looking hey Luke<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

298
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,000

299
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,760
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no one there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and which</font>

close it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see created for new</font>

304
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,290
is I think indeed it's increasing like

305
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,449
in last year where<font color="#E5E5E5"> proved 20 rfcs and</font>

basically the mother of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> hello</font>

503
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,360
let's let's do it in one one place and

504
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:13,669
it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly fast it's been</font>

505
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,779
crafted so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

506
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:21,590
implementation is rather simple so no

tlv spur say a fixed field format for

508
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,678
more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go to the web</font>

page and read the drafts always<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the</font>

510
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,240
dance that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so I be faster</font>

511
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,789
route we had a lot of talk yesterday

512
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,240
about that basically to summarize we

513
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:37,250
have basically pre calculate safe back

514
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,039
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hops and the time of failure was</font>

515
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,460
switched to them we have the something

516
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if was highlighted</font>

517
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:49,100
enough or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not when we started this work</font>

518
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,258
way specifically separated the basic

519
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,570
ferry route mechanisms from the advanced

520
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:56,330
ones and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that is pretty</font>

521
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:59,539
simple we have a lot of consensus about

522
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:02,830
how the basic stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> should work and it</font>

523
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:05,480
is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy calculation wise it's a</font>

524
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:09,559
minimal overhead computational and

525
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,649
affording plate and we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

526
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:16,460
advanced IP afar which is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elias</font>

527
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:21,939
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart stuff comes in the u-turns</font>

528
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:24,740
and tunnels the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback that we need is</font>

529
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,230
essentially it's a question of the the

530
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,659
balance between coverage and complexity

531
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,419
so the failure coverage for example with

532
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:34,009
a basic I<font color="#CCCCCC"> PFR are we get coverage</font>

533
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,379
depending on the topology of course

534
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:40,429
somewhere between sixty to ninety five

535
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:42,678
percent and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one important thing to</font>

536
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:44,539
understand is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

537
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,210
get covered then the management tools

538
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:49,370
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to tell you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll</font>

539
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,100
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at your network and see</font>

540
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:54,529
okay can I change my network topology

541
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,750
somehow can i increase redundancy in the

542
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:59,240
topology so that the coverage is

543
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,100
increased as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the same can be said</font>

544
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,379
about the micro loop converter coverage

545
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,939
the micro loop the basic micro loop for

546
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:07,039
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path locking mechanism</font>

547
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,649
gives you around ninety ninety percent

548
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,879
coverage of the original micro lips that

549
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:15,139
would happen otherwise and the

550
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:17,179
interesting property of the path locking

551
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,500
mechanisms that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> places where</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Michael loops are not covered for</font>

553
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,770
example or exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the places where</font>

554
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,610
you're not covered for covered from a

use for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example for IPO for our will</font>

forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> two operators</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are essentially</font>

how good<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good enough right so is</font>

561
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:45,410
eighty percent is ninety percent is

562
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,720
limited coverage good enough for you or

563
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,870
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we push it higher keeping in mind</font>

564
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:54,590
that the cost of it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be increased</font>

565
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:58,790
complexity and in some cases somewhat

increased<font color="#E5E5E5"> network conversions time so if</font>

00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,780
you guys have an opinion then speak up

at the mic yesterday we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,450
simply agreed to the speaker so the mic

574
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,689
if you're not comfortable speaking up

575
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:23,120
right now feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free to subscribe to this</font>

576
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:26,090
mailing list RC<font color="#E5E5E5"> gwg and the last piece</font>

577
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,459
is the PCE working group so it's

578
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:31,250
basically it's all about an element in

579
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,140
the network that knows more than you do

580
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,870
and you being the head and Ellis are

581
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,460
restrained you can compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MPLS</font>

582
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,590
traffic or gym pls traffic engineering

583
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,930
LSP so if you are for example

584
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,770
establishing a multi-region like multi

585
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:48,320
area LSP or an LSP crossing multiple

586
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:51,379
domains then you will not be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

587
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,419
calculate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that LSP m2n because you don't</font>

588
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,520
have visibility to the complete topology

589
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,010
of the network so the PCEs are the

590
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,800
elements that are known to you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

591
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,450
more visibility to that those parts of

592
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,050
the topology not visible to you so you

593
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:08,690
ask them basically please calculate you

594
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,639
know the segment of the LSP based on

595
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,170
these constraints and then when you

596
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,500
receive the reply you start signaling

597
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,750
those so we decided that should explore

598
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,540
this and right now we have the framework

599
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,370
document available and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">few days ago design team has been formed</font>

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,760
