00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
good afternoon everybody this<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,550
is a continuation of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ellie and dave</font>

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,389
has talked about in all kinds of details

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,820
so what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show here is analyzed</font>

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,250
some of these schemes actually a subset

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these schemes and look at how they</font>

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,680
perform in some realistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,070
scenarios we specifically consider two

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,160
types of IP passed without mechanisms

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,619
one is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the simplest ones look pre</font>

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,570
alternate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second one is what I</font>

12
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,079
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> alia pointed out as medium complex</font>

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,930
u-turn alternate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kinds of</font>

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">predictions we look at is a pure link</font>

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,610
failure that means we assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when</font>

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,449
you detect a local failure then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,940
link failure and use our alternate next

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,800
are based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but we usually cannot</font>

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,530
distinguish between router and Link

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,230
belly or so if the neighboring router is

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,660
really the one that failed then actually

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,279
we may see some loops we may not see it

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,979
in all cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at least in some cases</font>

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,110
to protect against that we can do a

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,020
router<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus link failure protection</font>

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,720
basically we do not use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighboring</font>

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,340
router as the next half<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that of</font>

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">course reduces the number of cooperates</font>

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,150
but that avoids getting into any

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,299
possible loop situation when the router

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,549
actually did pale in terms of

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,470
performance measures the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

33
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,960
you look at is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coverage or</font>

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,810
efficiency essentially we just want to

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,789
say that if there is a failure if there

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,740
wasn't any IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed it out then some</font>

37
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,900
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of profit will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be lost for some</font>

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,089
period of time we may debate up with it

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,520
is 200 millisecond 500 milliseconds or a

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,290
few seconds but until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,140
convergence happens we will have some

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,040
failures and how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the traffic can</font>

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,920
be saved by doing this IP faster around

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,170
convergence by the way the same thing of

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,479
course we could do when using mpls the

46
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,369
faster it out but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am NOT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

47
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover that at least about what this car</font>

48
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,420
since we are only talking about IP

49
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,390
passed it out in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the second</font>

50
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,459
point is in terms of from for a service

51
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,099
provider perspective is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the</font>

52
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,090
cost of providing this this IP faster it

53
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,799
out for example someone

54
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,319
could say that okay we can provide this

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,610
great 50<font color="#E5E5E5"> millisecond</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> convergence but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

56
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,530
have to keep one hundred percent more

57
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,910
capacity in the network then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

58
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,769
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most of the service providers</font>

59
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,109
will be interested in that so what we

60
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,239
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see is that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do some of</font>

61
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,220
these mechanisms then how much extra

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,690
capacity do we need in the network in

63
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:37,840
order to actually make it work<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

64
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:40,629
we consider two networks we<font color="#CCCCCC"> name them</font>

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">network one and network to the first one</font>

66
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:46,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a IP backbone network with 36</font>

67
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,980
doubters and about 49 links in this case

68
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,680
we have a point-to-point traffic matrix

69
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,929
between every pair of routers and this

70
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,989
network and traffic matrix is roughly

71
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,150
similar to an existing network and this

72
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,099
is the one of the ones we will look at

73
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,379
the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we call network</font>

74
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,179
to which is a boat a combination of

75
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,910
backbone and access network and this is

76
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,440
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> networks actually we similar</font>

77
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,440
to actually one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the networks that he</font>

78
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,910
planned for future in both cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

79
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,819
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have a network and traffic</font>

80
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,709
matrix for<font color="#CCCCCC"> network one we also wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

81
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,450
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can quit the network a</font>

82
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,579
little bit we change the topology little

83
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,440
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> add some links here and there and by</font>

84
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:29,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that if we can improve the</font>

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:31,480
convergence<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now in terms of what is</font>

86
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:33,609
the meaning of I guess coverage one

87
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,619
could define copper ideas how many

88
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,090
destinations are reachable during this

89
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,040
failure condition that's one way of

90
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,630
looking at it but we really want to look

91
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,190
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got it from a traffic for</font>

92
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,120
points point of view because we have

93
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,459
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there will be some</font>

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,139
destinations which are not reachable but

95
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,459
they are not carrying any traffic but is

96
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,470
there may be a small number of

97
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,819
destinations which are not reachable but

98
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,500
they may be carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very large amount</font>

99
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:57,040
of traffic so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want to</font>

100
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">know is for a given failure scenario we</font>

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,970
define X as the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic that</font>

102
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,310
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be lost if we did not do pastor</font>

103
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,200
doubt and why is the amount of traffic

104
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,480
that would be lost if we did do pass

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,518
figure out that means that is the case

106
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,679
where we do not have an feasible

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
alternate next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the</font>

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,730
efficiency will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> X minus y which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

109
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,738
the amount of traffic that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

110
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,810
divided<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the total amount of traffic</font>

111
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,518
that could potentially be lost expand as

112
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,890
Y over X that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple enough major</font>

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,410
now important thing to notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

114
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,000
is not uniform in any

115
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,500
network we see that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are many links</font>

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,330
where this<font color="#E5E5E5"> number could be hundred</font>

117
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,890
percent but there could be a few links

118
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,930
when this number could be say ten

119
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,900
percent or something pretty small<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

120
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,420
so what we will show here is the overall

121
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,880
average over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and we average</font>

122
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">about all possible failure scenarios in</font>

123
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,270
one case all single link failures in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

124
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,310
other case all single router failures

125
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,299
okay these are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial results and</font>

126
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:57,610
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network one if we did only Luke pre</font>

127
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,580
alternate then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw that in terms of</font>

128
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic the efficiency was about thirty</font>

129
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,710
three percent if we do look free and you

130
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,810
turn on turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a big jump at</font>

131
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,039
least in this example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump was from</font>

132
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,040
thirty three percent to eighty eight

133
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,660
percent now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course that is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true</font>

134
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,490
for every network like just as you see

135
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,040
down there for network<font color="#E5E5E5"> too we did the</font>

136
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,540
exact same study we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even with</font>

137
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,280
Luke free we could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eighty-nine</font>

138
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,620
percent which probably is quite

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,510
reasonable already and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do of</font>

140
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,950
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> Luke pre plus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tron there was</font>

141
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,320
one hundred percent coverage by the way

142
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,610
we did say that in this example there

143
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,770
are a few destinations that are not

144
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,420
reachable but those destinations are not

145
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,430
getting any traffic under no failure

146
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,540
condition so we did get hundred percent

147
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,720
coverage even with very small

148
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,100
destinations not being reachable<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,250
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did is that in</font>

150
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,290
network one since we knew as I said like

151
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,690
the good part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network coverage is</font>

152
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,640
very high there are some trouble spots

153
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,890
in the network where coverage was not be

154
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,140
getting very very well so we added some

155
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,570
strategic links in there and we saw that

156
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">there could be a jump for example with</font>

157
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,200
Luke<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre it goes to forty three percent</font>

158
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,340
and Luke pre plus internet goes to

159
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,050
almost hundred percent active

160
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,729
ninety-eight percent we did actually

161
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">other studies for example as they</font>

162
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,480
pointed out that we could solve this

163
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,060
problem using it or design and we can

164
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually in this particular network we</font>

165
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,830
did at the potential design where we

166
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,570
could change things efficiently so that

167
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,310
both kinds of coverage could be close

168
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,900
two hundred percent so that again is

169
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,090
something we can have in their back

174
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,490
this IP past it out we would like the

175
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,590
algorithms to be fast enough but of

176
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,180
course not too complicated but I gardens

177
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,280
to be smart enough so that whatever

178
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,230

solve that so from that perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

181
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,820
simple it has lots of advantages but it

182
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,560
is not the predictable that is in if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

you're not lucky we may not but if we do

193
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,049
was a simple picture we only looked at

link<font color="#CCCCCC"> barriers now let's make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it more</font>

195
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,090
complicated what happens if we also want

196
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,040
to protect against router failures okay

197
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,140
that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we want to show</font>

198
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,000
here the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we want to show is</font>

199
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,800
that we may not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed it out</font>

200
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,020
throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole network we may have</font>

201
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,000
only in the backbone so we show<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

202
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,400
where if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have it in backbone only and</font>

203
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,440
or if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have both in backbone plus</font>

204
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,679
access and this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network to which</font>

205
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">was well behaved anyway so in the link</font>

206
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,420
failure case we get close two hundred

207
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,760
percent in all cases except that if we

208
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,770
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the backbone only and we</font>

209
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,659
average<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all backbone and access</font>

210
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,010
link failures then it goes down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to about</font>

211
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,920
seventy two percent in this case

212
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,840
actually the backbone router was doing

213
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,410
past<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipf a straight out so traffic going</font>

214
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,210
from backbone to access was mostly being

215
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,620
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually saved only the traffic</font>

216
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,780
coming from the access to the backbone

217
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,780
side that was not being saved and that

218
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:15,169
that cost this drop in efficiency now if

219
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">we go to the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two rows that's where</font>

220
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,850
things are more complicated that is we

221
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,440
are not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a next hop which is</font>

222
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,150
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighboring router with the</font>

223
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">anticipation that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neighboring router</font>

224
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,099
may have failed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if we do that</font>

225
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,340
situation then even for link failures

226
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,320
our coverage goes down to some extent

227
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,110
100% it still stays pretty high like

228
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,850
eighty-six percent or seventy four

229
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,590
percent those kinds of things and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

230
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,240
outer failure if we do it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

231
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,730
backbone only we got fifty four percent

232
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,800
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do back 1 plus access we got</font>

233
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,750
sixty four percent so the basic bottom

234
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,510
line here is that protecting from outer

235
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,520
failure is

236
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,620
significantly more different difficult

237
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,939
than protecting us link belly or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

238
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,040
we did one more case which i am not

239
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,900
showing here that is the SR LG failure

240
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,209
so we looked at it large number of

241
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">guests are LG's network similar to an</font>

242
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,560
existing network and there we saw that

243
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,599
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as router failure is more</font>

244
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,280
difficult than loom link failure is an

245
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,800
LG failure prediction is also more

246
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,600
difficult than link failure and usually

247
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,370
its coverage is less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that of link</font>

248
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,330
failure but we are not showing all the

249
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:20,910
results at least in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

250
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,830
this is all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> coverage the next item</font>

251
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,600
is that how much extra resource do we

252
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,820
need like nothing comes for free<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

253
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,650
what is the price do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to pay in</font>

254
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,500
order to have this great i peep a

255
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:34,050
straight out in this example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pink</font>

256
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,770

257
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,650
traffic before any failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens ABCD</font>

258
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,780
suppose the b2c link fails so<font color="#E5E5E5"> B does a</font>

259
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,540
local repair and it decides that I will

260
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:49,410
go through the path a BEF d ok that the

261
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,050
top part<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and that's fine after a</font>

262
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,569
while all the notes have convergence and

263
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,819
if we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky then even after</font>

264
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:00,030
convergence may be a will decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

265
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,740
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the loot a BEF d then things</font>

266
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,530
will be perfect like we don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

267
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,320
extra bandwidth right the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP readout</font>

268
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster doubt will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same but in</font>

269
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,520
many cases we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that that is not the</font>

270
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,619
case like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> GP readout may take a</font>

271
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,600
completely different path because that's

272
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,800
based on the global knowledge it could

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,870
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through agh and d alright so in</font>

274
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,699
this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the way we designed our</font>

275
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,890
network is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we keep enough bandwidth</font>

276
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,350
for all primary traffic under no failure

277
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,600
then we consider all single link

278
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,730
Belliard and all single single router

279
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,130
failure cases and in something actually

280
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,380
we also do single<font color="#CCCCCC"> s or LG failures we</font>

don't show it here for all single

failure cases we want to make sure there

00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,620
is enough can do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> IG period out</font>

284
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,870
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok only the lower part so now if we</font>

285
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,160
do faster it out then we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

286
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,810
make sure that there is enough brand new

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,670
to the top part as well that is during

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast straight out and the main thing</font>

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,449
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show is that what is</font>

290

the Delta how much more do we need in

291
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,830
order to do faster it out this is one

292
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,920
example only

293
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:05,170
in this example we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did actually I gb</font>

294
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,839
passed it out only in the backbone the

295
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,390
link utilization limit we had was

296
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,160
eighty-five percent under normal

297
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,470
condition as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDP read out all</font>

298
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,410
sing the link and single film router

299
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:20,020
failures scenarios now if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did only</font>

300
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:24,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">igp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route we needed in this example</font>

301
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:28,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">network 829 OC 48 and about five seventy</font>

302
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">five thousand a 44 48 miles okay now if</font>

303
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,800
we did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with I GP +</font>

304
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,850

305
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,290
a 29 28 64 this actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only four</font>

306
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,750
percent increase so this actually is a

307
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive result that we can get was</font>

308
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,470
passed it out but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't need fifty</font>

309
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,180
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100% mode bandwidth and this in</font>

310
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,700
this example we needed four percent more

311
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,609
bandwidth one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to note is that</font>

312
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,800
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the OC 48 miles then the</font>

313
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">increase was about seven percent which</font>

314
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,969
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of means and is in this case when</font>

315
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,910
we have to put extra bandwidth we tend

316
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put it on longer links in order to do</font>

317
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,760
this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the bandwidth miles</font>

318
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,980
wide the increase is somewhat more but

319
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,950
also have to note that in this example

320
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are doing router failure prevention</font>

321
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,300
so there are many cases where it is it

322
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,209
was the faster it out was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not being used</font>

323
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,219
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did use fast it out if we could</font>

324
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the topology such that fast</font>

325
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">readout will be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in all cases then</font>

326
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,070
these numbers will<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up to some extent</font>

327
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,720
but still the good news is that this

328
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,280
probably not go down go up from four

329
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,230
percent to fifty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

330
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,150
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ten percent range which</font>

331
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,220
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what probably is acceptable because</font>

332
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,900
my guess is that most service providers

333
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,700
should not take the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we say</font>

334
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP passed without or for that</font>

335
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,630
matter mpls-tp fast without takes fifty

336
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,240
percent more capacity well it doesn't

337
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:49,360
another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is that</font>

338
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,710
since we can have qos in the network we

339
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,330
may not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to protect the whole</font>

340
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,590
band do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it during this IP pass straight</font>

341
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,480
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens only for a short</font>

342
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">time maybe a few second or maybe even</font>

343
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">five hundred milliseconds or so alright</font>

344
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,520
so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that period of time we could make</font>

345
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,690
the network design to to have something

346
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">say one hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ten percent</font>

347
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,170
utilization which means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if this ten</font>

348
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,370
percent of the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be dropped</font>

349
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,079
on the floor but that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

350
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,910
% only the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort traffic will be</font>

351
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,710
dropped if we have to us in the network

352
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,449
those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones which are probably</font>

353
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,190
not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking for past it out the</font>

354
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,200
ones that are looking for faster doubt

355
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,850
is probably the top 20 30 maybe fifty

356
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,870
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic and they will</font>

357
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,640
still be<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevented by this mechanism but</font>

358
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,230
the beauty of that is that we can get

359
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,180
that like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the last column</font>

360
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the second column the difference is</font>

361
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,469
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> little we can get IP passed without</font>

362
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,540
almost for free again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may not be true</font>

363
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,670
for all topologies and all conditions

364
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:45,099
practice in one example we show here

365
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,510
looks pretty pretty I guess convincing

366
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,810
all right actually this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my last life</font>

367
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:53,779
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I am being on time the main</font>

368
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:58,819
ideas we have here is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do fat</font>

369
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,990
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast it out then what the simple</font>

370
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,670
scheme to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be loop pre</font>

371
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,940
alternate it doesn't really depend on

372
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,069
your neighbor to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> special and</font>

373
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">only point drawback is that there are</font>

374
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:12,110
many topologies where its coverage may

375
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,050
not be high enough like at least as high

376
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,450
as we would desire if we add more

377
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,500
complexity like you turn alternate or of

378
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,540
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that matter any of the other</font>

379
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,980
algorithms then coverage can be made

380
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,250
very high<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe close two hundred</font>

381
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,500
percent but still one difficulty<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

382
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,800
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a router avoiding</font>

383
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,480
alternate paths then then it is it will

384
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,810
be more difficult to achieve the same

385
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,070
level of coverage now also<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

386
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,229
possible to have the IP passed without

387
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,580
in the backbone and we can get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

388
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,740
the benefits we don't necessarily have

389
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the whole network but of</font>

390
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,480
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it h2 edge then then</font>

391
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,670
benefits is even better and and the

392
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,720
final<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the extra capacity</font>

393
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:56,300
needs of IP pass without was not not

394
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:02,020
very high at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one example which</font>

395
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:05,510
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will be oh I'm sorry okay</font>

may slow down is that right be saying

link how would the convergence work with

430
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you're still talking about IP</font>

431
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:44,060
network not mpls right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct so</font>

432
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,160
not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your traffic needs the IP</font>

433
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,319
faster ear out the better convergence

434
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,750
time right now the rest of it you are

435
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what it does today which</font>

436
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,780
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> best effort which is it waits for the</font>

437
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,220
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish convert you know waits</font>

438
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,050
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the convergence tap and your drop it</font>

439
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,940
for you know depending you know 50

440
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,469
milliseconds a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds whatever</font>

441
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:06,290
depending upon local and network so that

442
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:08,329
if you have the utilization of the links

443
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,930
be allowed to be higher or as<font color="#CCCCCC"> goggin was</font>

444
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:13,698
suggesting during the convergence time

445
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:16,390
that means well more more of your best

446
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:19,370
effort traffic is likely to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get dropped</font>

447
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:23,770
right and the mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical as long</font>

448
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:25,969
as it was within the necessary bounds um

449
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,360
would get the benefit from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the faster</font>

450
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,460
your app hmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok is it does that answer</font>

451
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,189
your question<font color="#E5E5E5"> er um kinda we can take</font>

452
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,380
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> off fine ok thanks ok</font>

453
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,020
okay well I'd like to thank our three

454
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:44,410
panelists for their description of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

455
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,410
analysis going ongoing research
