1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you and good morning so sue</font>

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,620
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I'm talking about the traffic</font>

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,649
engineer we introduced to our backbone

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,198
that's based on i GPT owning and it's

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,800
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the experience that we</font>

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,490
made why doing this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just try to</font>

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,640
focus on those design issues that might

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,909
be interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,190
similar stuff so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overview of</font>

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">the presentation first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to</font>

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:41,300
explain why we choose to do this

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,760
approach lively choose to do igp tuning

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:48,059
in our MPLS Network and then two main

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:52,140
topics first how we get the traffic

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,328
metrics I quickly explain or try to give

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,870
an overview<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ADP beige a based</font>

17
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,140
approach that we are using and then also

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,000
some issue that we saw with some data

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,570
still missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this in turn how we</font>

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">work with that next main topic is</font>

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,000
simulation and optimization I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

22
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,490
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is important when</font>

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,360
defining the topology to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,419
engineering on some metric design issues

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,530
we went into a cross and then I'm going

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk about what we use as a virtual</font>

27
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,850
topology and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like then</font>

28
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,030
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a summarization of our</font>

29
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:38,149
conclusions and what we intend to do in

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:40,860
the future so in order to understand the

31
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">motivation for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our approach let me first</font>

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,990
give you a few words on the network

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,009
design that we are actually using in our

34
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,460
network that is we actually do use mpls

35
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:57,750
ldp for all traffic that is for VPN as

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:01,979
well as for public IP traffic and so our

37
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,290
backbone mainly has two types of mpls

38
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,289
colleges which we call label switch

39
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:13,230
routers or lsr and label edge routers or

40
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,600
le are commonly they're probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> named p</font>

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,790
and

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,010
PE but I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the red label switch</font>

43
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,060
router because it makes some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their</font>

44
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,820
properties more clear the<font color="#E5E5E5"> label switch</font>

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,340
routers only do label switching no IP

46
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,560
lookups so they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have the</font>

47
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,760
full routing table we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

48
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,220
BGP freak or the label each artist of

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,200
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the full</font>

50
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,050
routing table they have to do the IP

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,290
lookup to decide what egress la are to

52
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:48,070
send the traffic towards and push the

53
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,290
appropriate label however the network is

54
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,260
not all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear there are some</font>

55
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:58,079
routers which are mixed type they have

56
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:00,790
NSR functionality as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as le</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are and</font>

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll see that there are some issues</font>

58
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this so the main line we use mpls</font>

59
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:11,700
for forwarding in the core but the

60
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,700
routing is still determined<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the IGP</font>

61
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:21,310
well short visual to explain this the

62
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:24,790
red links only carry mpls traffic the

63
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:28,900
green links IP traffic as IP traffic as

64
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:31,929
to the customers so the MPLS cloud can

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,240
be thought of as consisting as of the

66
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:41,500
MPLS call with the switching routers and

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:44,440
the edge with the edge routers so why

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,200
did we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ITP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metric</font>

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,970
tuning on statement you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can usually hear</font>

70
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,630
when talking about traffic engineering

71
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,550
is that well if you have an MPLS Network

72
00:03:52,630 --> 00:04:00,579
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can easily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do traffic engineering by</font>

73
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:04,600
RSVP based explicit routing so well

74
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,720
before deciding actually did some

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,750
research we first try to get our traffic

76
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,300
metrics then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> designs</font>

77
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,910
different algorithms towards from

78
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:19,570
different vendors on our particular

79
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,478
topology and an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic metrics and</font>

80
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,870
had a closer look on what possible

81
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,969
results would be so the result was that

82
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,760
of course

83
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,570
item ization of explicit routing was

84
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,270
somewhat better when compared to metric

85
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,940
tuning but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference was not that</font>

86
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">big it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a relatively small difference</font>

87
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,800
and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand explicit routing</font>

88
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:48,330
promised to introduce a lot of new risks

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,340
and pitfalls the complexity thing and on

90
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,320
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand SPF based routing is well</font>

91
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,419
understood by operations it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,250
and so in this trade-off between

93
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,200
complexity and optimization we just

94
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp approach would be</font>

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">good enough well this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a result of her</font>

96
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:15,090
a study done by caradin based on our

97
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:18,150
data they try to visualize the result

98
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">for different approaches this diagram we</font>

99
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,989
have the maximum link utilization in the

100
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:30,320
normal case on the x-axis and the y-axis

101
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:34,800
the worst failure link utilization so

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,020
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the theoretical optimum when</font>

103
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,300
just using default metrics with no

104
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,990
tuning we would be where would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there</font>

105
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,220
and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are different results for</font>

106
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,590
different approaches of traffic

107
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,810
engineering actually I can't comment

108
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:55,020
much on those with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dynamic and</font>

109
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:57,419
explicit routing but these numbers were

110
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,690
such<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could verify them</font>

111
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,400
exactly actually before introducing

112
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,100
traffic engineering we haven't been

113
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">there we had some kind of manual metric</font>

114
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,600
tuning and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

115
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,970
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering we were about here</font>

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,000
so from here to there there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

117
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:20,820
from there to there it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,770
so we decided for this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font>

119
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,719
always critical for traffic engineering

120
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,919
to actually know the traffic metrics

121
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,900
demands<font color="#E5E5E5"> from end to end and our approach</font>

122
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:35,190
is what we call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ADP based approach</font>

123
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:37,409
it has been explained in more detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

124
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,210
the previous presentation and if you are

125
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in some of the details I</font>

126
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:45,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">suggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stefan data directly he</font>

127
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:50,310
actually developed and implemented the

128
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:52,380
exact algorithm so I want just to give

129
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,190
an overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prerequisites that</font>

130
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,490
are necessary for for this approach

131
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:01,139
first thing is we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mpls</font>

132
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,289
counters from all the label switch

133
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,930
routers and some of the actual routing

134
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:10,229
information then we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

135
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">topology as it can be derived from</font>

136
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:16,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">router configurations and this allows us</font>

137
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,180
to get the real traffic metrics for all

138
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,150
forwarding equivalence classes between

139
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,240
all the letters ours so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

140
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:27,419
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually can measure the</font>

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,500
exact traffic metrics without having to

142
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:37,289
do the full measure of te tardes without

143
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to mess with actual routing this</font>

144
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,919
is how how the commands views for

145
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,280
polling look like on juniper routers

146
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:48,030
it's show LEP traffic statistics and

147
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:54,359
some kind of show<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our table we do</font>

148
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:57,750

149
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,020
you see and what interface those fights

150
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,969
go to and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

151
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,340
one interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about the junipers</font>

152
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:08,039
is that they distinguish between transit

153
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,960
and ingress<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp traffic transit meaning</font>

154
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,050
traffic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is purely mpls switched</font>

155
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,719
while ingress meaning packets that come

156
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:20,669
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers IP packets and then get</font>

157
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:23,849
an MPLS label on cisco routers it's just

158
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:27,419
the show mpls forwarding table and again

159
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:30,000
this gives us all we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FEC the</font>

160
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,370
bytes switched in this FEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,370
outgoing interface this also nicely

162
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,799
shows what happens with ecmp multipath

163
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,250
and shows all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outgoing interfaces</font>

164
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,649
and the exact distribution however we

165
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,170
ran into some issue with what Cisco

166
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:49,160
understands under<font color="#CCCCCC"> bites text switched in</font>

167
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,400
this context and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they turned out that</font>

168
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,219
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really only counts and report</font>

169
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:00,290
what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPLS packets so what juniper</font>

170
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:02,990
says quartz transit and so far we have

171
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,560
no feasible way of counting the IP

172
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:09,640
packets per FEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and read them in a</font>

173
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,760
feasible manner at least them as of<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

174
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:17,270
so the problem for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our approach is when</font>

175
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,819
these are missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we wrongly see</font>

176
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,660
the directly connected IP sources at the

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">next mpls hope and not at the router</font>

178
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,030
where the traffic is actually sourced

179
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:32,450
this only affects those routers of the

180

<font color="#CCCCCC">mixed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lsr</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> le type and fortunately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

181
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:38,960
are only a few routers of this type in

182
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,750
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network however they do create a lot</font>

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic so it's still important to</font>

cope with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this situation the good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

185
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:52,280
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that we at least know how much</font>

186
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,390
traffic is missing from the interface

187
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:59,540
counters try to visualize<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we have</font>

188
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:03,580
the MPLS design and let's say we were

189
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:07,939
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic that goes from this</font>

le are on that path to that le are so

191
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">because let's say this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cisco router</font>

192
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,160
and then it does not count the packets

193
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,500
coming into on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP link and so</font>

194
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,079
actually if our project looks like the

195
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,910
traffic were sourced here we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

196
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,670
it's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that some traffic is</font>

197
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,040
missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because interface counters on</font>

198
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,790
this link will report more traffic than

199
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,740
we actually see by LEP counters but we

200
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,170
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a terrific seen</font>

201

on this link goes over there or maybe

202
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:44,959
over there or wherever so in order to

203
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,360
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation we developed</font>

204
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,080
two algorithms for extra creating this

205
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,500
missing data one is based on data from

206

wheel le ours that might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to</font>

207
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,970
the node and if that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> available we</font>

208
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,640
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another algorithm that just uses</font>

209
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the traffic coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back from all</font>

210
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,490
possible destinations and use this to

211
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,520
extrapolate

212
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,399
tribution of the missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic and we</font>

213
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,380
can use whichever of those two methods

214
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:22,320
that fits best for each affected router

215
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:24,720
okay next topic is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> topology at least</font>

216
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,149
in large networks with hundreds of

217
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,940
routers in the backbone and even more

218
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:32,730
routers in the edge and you probably

219
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,950
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to select a sub topology for doing</font>

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,720
impression was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is runs fine if you</font>

225
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,630
have less than 100 routers and maybe a

226
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,020
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand demands in the T equal but</font>

227
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,939
that probably problems would occur when

228
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,399
there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundreds of routers and tens</font>

229
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,520
of thousands of demands to be simulated

230
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,500
and optimized of course it depends on

231
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the exact tool you're using on the exact</font>

232
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,829
algorithm and everything but then also

233
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:13,980
the etchant regional routers might not

234
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:16,229
really contribute much to the actual

235
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,630
purpose of traffic engineering so it's

236
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really necessary to include all the</font>

243
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,020
these links distribute traffic on them

244
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:44,010
and we also need some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

245
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:48,540
representation for the routers that are

246
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:51,410
outside of the T topology so things

247
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:54,329
would be easy in that kind of ideal

248
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,910
topology very had in traffic engineering

249

<font color="#CCCCCC">them by one link to the T equal however</font>

251
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,370
in reality it's more complicated regions

252
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">are likely to have more than one uplink</font>

253
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:12,209
to the core maybe they have even links

254
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:14,339
between them so it becomes more

255
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,709
complicated to select the right sub

256
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,630
topology and it might easily become a

257
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:22,260
trade-off<font color="#E5E5E5"> between exact</font>

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the other hand then we also ran into</font>

260
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:35,520
some issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerning the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp metric</font>

261
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,610
Design for traffic engineering it's in

262
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,010
requirement or at least a good idea to

263
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">be as liberal as possible with the</font>

264
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:46,920
metrics that the optimization<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm</font>

265
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:50,370
is allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to select so the optimization</font>

266
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:54,300
algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> can choose as law or some high</font>

267
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:57,120
metrics as it considers useful and then

268
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:02,520
on the other hand use large metrics in

269
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:05,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the regions so that they don't mess with</font>

270
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,770
a core metrics so we get a predictable

271
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,500
routing and the traffic metrics stay

272
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:13,740
stable on the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are</font>

273
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:18,140
using I BGP route reflection there are

274
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:20,520
some requirements mentioned in RFC 3345

275
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,920
concerning the link metrics and it says

276
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,880
that inter-cluster links must always

277
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,760
have an higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITP metric than any link</font>

278
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,340
with inner cluster and this is required

279
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,700
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure to avoid persistent route</font>

280
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,710
oscillation well this is easily in

281
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,890
contradiction because inter-cluster

282
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:44,700
links frequently are likely to be within

283
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:46,880
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> network while the intracluster</font>

284

links are likely to be within a region

one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might do in the future is</font>

scenarios could you give us a little bit

437
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">more details on on why we're thinking of</font>

438
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,700
that for forwarding decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> president</font>

439
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,849
bits or did you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mix them two</font>

440
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">together</font>

441
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:20,150
okay well one thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are happy</font>

442
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:23,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the IGP metric tuning based</font>

443
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:27,049
approach and we are quite reluctant to

444
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:29,330
introduce a full measure of tunnels for

445
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:33,350
the whole traffic including all the best

446
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,549
effort traffic so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to use we are</font>

447
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,620
like really looking forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

448
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:40,879
approach that allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to still do</font>

449
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,969
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp tuning at least for the mess</font>

450
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,549
of the traffic for the best effort class

451
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,230
so on this is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and the other</font>

452
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:53,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well we want to do traffic</font>

453
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:59,000
engineering on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TE core not on some</font>

454
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">h2h based approach so the router</font>

455
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,380
actually at the border<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the TE</font>

456
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:06,139
topology has to do the decision of what

457
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:11,390
routing to use for each packet so we do

458
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:18,110
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this forwarding based on</font>

459
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:19,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> qos bits good and last question is</font>

460
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,070
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> always what everyone wants to</font>

461
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">know which is what was your worst</font>

462
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:31,820
difficulty in getting all of this put

463
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:33,980
together well technically maybe the most

464
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,678
interesting is interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to</font>

465
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,790
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the calculation of the</font>

466
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,020
traffic metrics running and

467
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">organisational there's of course a lot</font>

468
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,700
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems in companies is because</font>

469
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,918
hours to get planning operations

470
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,000
development research and engineering or

471
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">together thank you again Martin I'm</font>

472
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,600
really appreciate the time and I'll take

473
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,699
the next speaker as I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

474
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,340
time is a whoop excuse me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

475
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:05,240
to be the only questions you can just

476
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:08,480
wait go ahead yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> sergio france</font>

477
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">télécom so very good presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

478
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,100
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i have a two</font>

479
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,549
questions one is do you consider to the

480
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:21,490
case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a SAS with traffic</font>

481
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:24,139
engineering extensions and the is a st

482
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,970
and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> person is who you are</font>

483
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,280
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SLA kind of</font>

484
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,610
motivations do you have in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

485
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,410
there are some kind of TV or voice and

486
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,330
video carry out of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> bells I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

487
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got that right of first</font>

488
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:44,060
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> were saanchi extensions of ours</font>

489
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:48,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">is yes I I know there are there is a</font>

490
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:51,350
separate metric link metric available

491
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:55,160
for the TE case as it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by the</font>

492
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">dynamic RSVP based approaches yes so</font>

493
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,460
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no point in using this if you</font>

494
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:03,440
just have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp for our routing we</font>

495
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,350
just have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one Tripoli tree I know</font>

496
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different link metrics are there but</font>

497
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:11,600
so far we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have any possibility to</font>

498
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,720
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these the other question was</font>

499
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:19,459
concerning SL<font color="#E5E5E5"> aids well we do have</font>

500
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:23,170
certain SLS like latency from end to end

501
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:26,180
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the region and by using</font>

502
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:30,460
simulation we make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

503
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,460
still met<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>
