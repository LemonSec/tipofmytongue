00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,570
to be talking about the event overall

Igor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jasinski from yahoo is going to be</font>

them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick Gilmore who will be</font>

36
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this as sort of three mini</font>

37
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,040
sessions we've got 45 minutes I think

38
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,930
each of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speakers is going to spend</font>

39
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,820
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes and if you have</font>

40
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,670
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> for any one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the speakers if</font>

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,019
you would hold them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of that</font>

42
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,079
but do it not for the end of the session

43
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:46,160
just for the end of who's speaking so

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:48,769
I'll hand it over to Leslie now thanks

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,140
Phil um and as Phil said I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

46
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,900
give a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overview</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day and</font>

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,350
and why we care about it and why we

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:01,579
think you should too so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is</font>

49
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">June ate all of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in universal time at</font>

50
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:05,840
which point major content providers have

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,820
agreed to turn on ipv6 on their front

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,510
doors not just on their side doors as

53
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,750
often is the case today it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

54
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:19,399
to do with turning off ipv4 it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is</font>

55
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:21,739
about an<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to both motivate</font>

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,660
organizations across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

57
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:27,170
internet service providers carriers

58
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,670
content providers etc and users to

59
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,380
prepare themselves and their services

60
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:38,450
for for ipv6 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> enix to ensure a</font>

61
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:43,400
successful transition to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ipv4 an ipv4</font>

62
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:45,739
ipv6 world it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> an opportunity to</font>

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,740
collaborate to test writing

64
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,890
and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about laying the</font>

65
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,800
groundwork for what we hope will be

66
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:58,170
large-scale long-term deployment of ipv6

67
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,710
I will note this is not a first it's

68
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,420
certainly the biggest so far but other

69
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,960
other entities in other parts of the

70
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">world have organized similar events so</font>

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,730
we have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of what</font>

72
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,880
we're getting into so why we care about

73
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,539
it so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Society we believe</font>

74
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a best internet is one with</font>

75
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,710
continued global addressing I think

76
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,450
everybody in this room understands

77
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,969
pretty well but if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

78
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,460
continued global addressing ipv4 is not

79
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,340
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the future so v6 is where we</font>

80
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,930
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point of having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

81
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,380
day and the point of why we're

82
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,890
supporting it is to help accelerate ipv6

83
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,610
deployment we believe that 2011 is going

84
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,050
to be a pivotal year for ipv6 deployment

85
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,550
not the least of which is because as of

86
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,390
this week we're running out of ipv4

87
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,430
addresses for reals and we think that

88
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world ipv6 day is going to be an</font>

89
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,550
important milestone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well ipv6</font>

90
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,260
has to work if we're going to exit 2011

91
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,920
into a future globally connected

92
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,900
internet and not just a network and it

93
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,300
must work not just technically it has to

94
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,489
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for businesses has to be business</font>

95
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,270
viable and has to have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

96
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,310
visible traffic and usage ultimately so

97
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,780
far everybody's known this at an

98
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,730
academic level understood it

99
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,159
hypothetically but it's been a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

100
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,140
moving target to really try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay</font>

101
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,840
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deadline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by which I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

102
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">get myself prepared or it's just been a</font>

103
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,099
bit of a moving target it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

104
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,990
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test your own</font>

105
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,960
config in the light of a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> date</font>

106
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it will be a lot easier to measure</font>

107
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,090
actual impact of v4 v6 coexistence with

108
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,190
an event<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our perspective</font>

109
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,570
so what we have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> already since the</font>

110
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,180
press release a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

111
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,909
there's been lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest from all</font>

112
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,630
over which is certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> good news we've</font>

113
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">had interest from content providers</font>

114
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">isps websites about 125 people entities</font>

115
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:08,490
overall we are we have websites listed

116
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:12,280
on the official webpage for the day

117
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,190
we're creating space for sites who are

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,320
running dual staff already that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is who</font>

119
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,350
wish to be recognized for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their efforts</font>

120
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:25,450
and recognizes places you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go visit</font>

121
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:27,610
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are testing out your ipv6 and we</font>

122
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,770
will be creating space as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well for the</font>

123
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,590
25 or so networks and hosting companies

124
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,030
who offer commercial v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who are</font>

125
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,359
interested in helping their customers

126
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,979
participate so clearly there's interest

127
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more customers but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interest for us to help direct people to</font>

00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,180
for material and information available

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day itself so it's essentially</font>

136
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,020
so far we've already had interest from

137
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,890
all over the globe so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really will be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a world ipv6 day so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we hope</font>

a general content provider perspective

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,310
of it so first of all why are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we doing</font>

205
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,050
it we're doing to promote the ipv6

it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's doable it should be</font>

208
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,630
done and we're also trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break the</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> going hey we want to turn off v6</font>

214
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,870
the effort into enabling v6 we need

215
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:08,050
actual users so we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a date that</font>

216
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,600
is set for and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to have users and</font>

we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have content this is also</font>

220
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:20,950
can't see that well but it's there in

221
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,050
the slides it's a Aaron with you get a

222
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,270
pity sex info that list a lot of causes

223
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,339
of those broken users most of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

224
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,459
operating systems thinking that there is

v6 when these sex isn't working in the

226
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:36,219
end user the current breakage stats are

227
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,109
about point O to six percent 18 months

228
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:45,520
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point O seven eight percent so</font>

229
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:48,310
it's a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> improvement better while</font>

230
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that number seems very low and perfectly</font>

231
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,779
acceptable point 0 to six percent for a

232
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,180
global content provider lucky ah who

233
00:11:52,779 --> 00:12:00,640
translates to roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 150 six thousand</font>

234
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:02,410
users we fully expect that the 156,000

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:09,220
users will not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to us well</font>

236
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:11,290
on world ipv6 day and we're also one of

237
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,390
the reasons we're doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is</font>

238
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,339
the last ditch effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove the need</font>

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:18,130
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> white listing as long as the</font>

240
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,750
breakage stats are above 0 point 0 1

241
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,149
percent there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely no way that</font>

242
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:26,680
we could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual staff in a full</font>

243
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:29,350
production scenario hopefully six months

244
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,899
awareness you know more things getting

245
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,520
fixed the numbers will drop enough and

246
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,650
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not perhaps there's going to be</font>

247
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,100
enough press generated by world ipv6 day

248
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:43,750
and by users breaking that there will

249
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:46,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually get fixed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

250
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,560
for all that baby<font color="#CCCCCC"> sucks day from a</font>

251
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,540
content provider perspective is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

252
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,839
removes the first implemented penalty if

253
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,240
Google are the only ones to enable ipv6

254
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:02,140
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack and nobody else's then</font>

255
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,300
those 156,000 users will go up dub dub

256
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,459
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> website com hmm not working</font>

259
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:14,199
way hopefully all of us are part of all

260
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,630
that pd six-day the user goes yahoo com

261

267
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,899
I saw Oh has organized this so enough of

268
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,490
us are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this we want the</font>

269
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:39,250
user to be aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has a problem</font>

270
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:42,180

276
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,079

Yahoo is doing is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be serving</font>

well

357

358
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,730
because I'm wondering if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> pv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day goes</font>

359
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,039
well what's what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> barrier threshold</font>

360
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,220
for you from extending it from ipv6 day

361
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,470
to ipv6 two days or are you just going

362
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pull the plug after a day no matter</font>

363
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,919
what we're going to pull the plug<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

364
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,450
a day no matter what because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't</font>

365
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,139
measure brokenness while we're running

366
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,090
dual stuff so what we're actually hoping

367
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:15,488
to gain out of this is that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

368
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,749
before then stats the day after and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

369
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,609
if there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a delta in the broken</font>

370
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:20,080
user problem if the brokenness has

371
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:23,168
dropped below a certain threshold that

372
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,820
we have decided then there's nothing

373
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,850
stopping us if the brokenness is still

374
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:33,939
this high we will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> choice but to</font>

375
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:37,529
do whitelisting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i hope you review</font>

376
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,529
that choice thank you

380
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:50,570
the broken host problem have you looked

381
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,760
at the test ipv6 com site and do you

382
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,710
believe if that gives you a green light

383
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,390
response that you will not be affected

384
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,750
by the broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose problem you</font>

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I said the adjacent fesslers one of</font>

387
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:09,409
my co-workers and a lot of the test

388
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:10,790
cases are actual things that we similar

389
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,220
methodology to how a lot of people

390
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:16,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">measure of brokenness there's only one</font>

website doesn't catch and we're not

393
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,090
quite sure how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to measure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and that's</font>

394
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,550
if you've configured a socks proxy on

your browser and socks proxies before

396
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:31,340
only we just have we haven't found a

397
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,439
good way to capture the test case every

398
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,230
other if you're not using proxies

399

configured in your browser that website

400
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,720
should capture everything else great

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:58,940
why are there two optimizer I<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's a</font>

424
00:20:55,309 --> 00:21:00,320
PDF it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> much harder to see the</font>

425
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,140
screen that it is that screen believe it

426
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:07,340
or not and the mouse is really fast I

427
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,640
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will come as a shock to all of</font>

428
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,409
you but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little sleepy and my voice</font>

429
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,679
is a little bed I'm sure no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one here can</font>

430
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,790
figure out why that is so my name is

431
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:22,610
Patrick Gilmore I work for a company

432
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:24,889
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> akamai technologies we are CDN we</font>

433
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,350
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost no content of our own we do</font>

434
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,330
have www me com which by the way has a

435
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,159
v6 bug on it so if you all go there we

436
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,439
can collect info on the nanog network or

437
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,330
something like that but very very few

438
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,830
people visit that however<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

439
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,649
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of content from other people</font>

440
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,830
so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that is that we have</font>

441
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,809
no agenda well we have an agenda but we

442
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,220
have no agenda that we can push because

443
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:50,389
our customers pay us to do certain

444
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">things so they tell us you know do v6 or</font>

445
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,530
don't do v6 then that's what we're going

446
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,750
to do and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get a much of</font>

447
00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:00,200
a voice in the decision we can suggest

448
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but we are a service provider we</font>

449
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,150
don't get to decide what to do with you

450
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,059
know our customers own content we do

451
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,590
understand v6 is critical to the

452
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,879
Internet's future I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds</font>

453
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">like marketing speak but I actually</font>

454
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,419
wrote that line because I believe it I

455
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:20,620
think it is critical which is sad but

456
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:22,880
true so we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make this</font>

457
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,500
transition as seamless as possible for

458
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">our customers the idea is that the</font>

459
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,400
customer should be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font>

460
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,620
please v6 of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 my webpage and then they</font>

461
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,480
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do anything so we're doing</font>

462
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of stuff like allowing them to keep</font>

463
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,120
it before origin host and then we'll go

464
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,770
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> well get see the caches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / v 4 and</font>

465
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,120
then serve the end users / v6 for

466
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,190
instance and things like that to make it

467
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,959
as seamless as possible and we're hoping

468
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help a little bit of the hump</font>

469
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,860
to get to v6 if people can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

470
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:52,070
switch it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> without doing anything</font>

471
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,990
themselves um<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus to be perfectly</font>

472
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">honest I want to make</font>

473
00:22:52,990 --> 00:23:00,450
any off of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um we agree that v six</font>

474
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:03,160
days is necessary we've been you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

475
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,350
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an integral part of it from</font>

476
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">late stages but you know long before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

477
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:12,370
press release we obviously want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

478
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:14,920
what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens empirical data is</font>

479
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,178
much much better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of guesswork</font>

480
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,550
and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there right now</font>

481
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:20,290
are guessing hey Igor has some stats or

482
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,550
yeah who has some stats and some you

483
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,230
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> google has some stats and a few</font>

484
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,520
others do but a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are just</font>

485
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,010
saying well we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will happen</font>

486
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,830
and so we'd like to actually see what

487
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,410
happens so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to support anybody</font>

488
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,340
who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do v6 on the Akamai network</font>

489
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,100
obviously is going to help them find fix

490
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,919
find in fix broken end users and the

491
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,959
chicken and egg problem the last two are

492
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,760
the big thing everybody talks about

493
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,440
chicken and egg oh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have enough</font>

494
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,940
content on be 60 no users will be able t

495
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,370
60 we don't have enough users on b6

496
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,840
they'll be no content on v6 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality</font>

497
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that there'd be plenty of content on</font>

498
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,709
v6 if they weren't broken end users

499
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,230
that's the real chicken and egg it's not

500
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,730
that there isn't any content on v6 is

501
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody wants to put their content</font>

502
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,080
on v6 because you know Yahoo Google

503
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,489
Akamai ourselves we don't want to lose

504
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a million dollars a day or</font>

505
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,640
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those hundred thousand</font>

506
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:10,270
users<font color="#E5E5E5"> that someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we disappear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

507
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,530
clog our helpdesk lines so we're hoping

508
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:15,490
this will get us to a point where we can

509
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:17,110
go ahead and get past that<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh so the</font>

510
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,710
way Akamai is trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is we</font>

511
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:22,600
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to map both Internet's people</font>

512
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,860
think of optimized a caching company but

513
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,980
what we really do is figure out which

514
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,770
web server goes to which end user um

515
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,720
there's two<font color="#E5E5E5"> internets everybody here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

516
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably aware that v6 and before don't</font>

517
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,270
look like it turns out I'm a few nights

518
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago I said that v6 looks like the v6 net</font>

519
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,800
looks like Swiss cheese only it's the

520
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,149
holes not the cheese<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's getting</font>

521
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,909
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it actually still looks like</font>

522
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have some test data Akamai has</font>

523
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,080
served v6 traffic and we looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

524
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:53,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we took for instance a little under</font>

525
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,669
10,000 name servers picked randomly in

526
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,050
the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States and decided when they</font>

527
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,470
would ask for a hostname we would give

528
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,168
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> a v6 a quad a instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

529
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:03,270
a and see what would happen on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

530
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:06,870
our test<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network not on customer stuff</font>

531
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,610
um the latency was nearly double I

532
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,250
actually had to bring up my iPad so I

533
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,990
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual members latency</font>

534
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:16,110
was forty eight milliseconds for v4 and

535
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,549
eighty seven milliseconds for v6 I don't

536
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,199
know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you actually used</font>

537
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,750
Akamai but nobody pays Akamai just slow

538
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,610
stuff down that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not what they're</font>

539
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,960
trying to do on of the Akamai network

540
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,539
and it's not what we're trying to do

541
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,150
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's a huge huge slow down</font>

542
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:32,158
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tunnels it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

543
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:34,919
worse and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people go why are you</font>

544
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">measuring tunnels well we like I said we</font>

545
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,850
have a web bug on Akamai com which I

546
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,200
admit fully admit there's a little bit

547
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,289
of selection bias there but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font>

548
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">get some hits on it eighty nine point</font>

549
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:47,908
four percent that's almost ninety

550
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,580
percent of all v6 users coming to the

551
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:53,250
Akamai website are through tunnels I

552
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,530
mean there's essentially no one whose

553
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:57,210
native I mean ten percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten point six</font>

554
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,668
percent is just not worth talking about

555
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:02,309
so until we get these problems solved

556
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:04,080
until we can you know either get tunnels

557
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:07,320
in every single poppin you know

558
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,658
everywhere or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get more native</font>

559
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,250
v6 then there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be these</font>

560
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,770
adoption hurdles people don't want their

561
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,710
website to slow down to dot v6 this is a

562
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Akamai's planning to do</font>

563
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,890
is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and map both</font>

564
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">internets we're going to see how fast</font>

565
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,210
the v6 is how fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4 is and when</font>

566
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,350
somebody comes to us first we you know

567
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,750
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have technology to figure</font>

568
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,129
out if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're v6 enabled if they're not</font>

569
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,919
obviously they get a fee for a dress

570
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,890
that's easy if they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll do a</font>

571
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,260
measurement and we'll figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out okay</font>

572
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,880
we'll v4b has revealed will be six be

573
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,580
faster so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm having trouble talking</font>

574
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,870
can't imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> why but we'll hand out the</font>

575
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,389
one that's faster and will let customers

576
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,799
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> knob to figure that out Oh a v6</font>

577
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,679
is within ten percent go ahead and hand

578
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,780
out v6 or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we are</font>

579
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do everything we can to push</font>

580
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,889
this along and give the customers every

581
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,539
option they can but at the end of the

582
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:01,110
day is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers website so we</font>

583
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:03,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do what they say and that's I</font>

584
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,090
think our strategy hopefully in a very

585
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,620
condensed nutshell obviously you can't

586
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,029
take an entire corporate strategy that

587
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,309
took a year to do in same

588
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:16,210
five minutes but hopefully that gave you

589
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:22,119
some idea I was worried Duane was going

590
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:26,889
to ask a question he's always scary yes

591
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:29,769
sir far left my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is Chris wealthy</font>

592
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:33,519
from switch we host<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ack my cluster in</font>

593
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:36,789
Switzerland and and my question is are

594
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:42,129
you going to turn on v6 also<font color="#E5E5E5"> fool or</font>

595
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:44,169
non-us deployments yes in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

596
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:46,330
the internet exchanges that are

597
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:48,789
currently v6 pairing or not in the

598
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,289
United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I should say by the way</font>

599
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:51,789
I don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that's the</font>

600
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:53,080
10,000 name servers are just under

601
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:54,399
10,000 name servers we picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> were in</font>

602
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">North America so those numbers were</font>

603
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,218
North American but we are rolling it out

604
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:01,570
worldwide it's just we have 1700 pops in

605
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:03,879
72 countries it takes a little while to

606
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,589
ask every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one for a v6 address</font>

607
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:09,189
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then go and reconfigure the servers</font>

608
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:10,809
but hopefully cross your fingers every

609
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">single internet exchange should have v6</font>

610
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:15,039
by the end of this quarter I I know I

611
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,949
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for last quarter but this</font>

612
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,899
quarter really should be done and we're

613
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the Akamai nodes</font>

614
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:26,949
inside of networks and transit nodes v6

615
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:29,080
ified you know shortly thereafter yes

616
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,659
sir hi my name is Mossad am I you should

617
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,649
know America can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back to us right</font>

618
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:40,059
yes sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my god agnostic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nia will use</font>

619
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:41,738
this to be on ipv6 day you around again

620
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:43,928
we do whatever our customers tell us to

621
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:46,450
do so we have some customers that told

622
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:48,159
us to just dual stack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do that</font>

623
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,919
and we have the capability to do that on

624
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,779
a per host name basis so customers who

625
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:54,609
tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dual stack and pay no</font>

626
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:57,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">attention to the telemetry will do that</font>

627
00:28:54,609 --> 00:29:02,509
if they tell us to do this will do this

628
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:04,669
no worries can i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to us</font>

629
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:07,279
not the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is Hawaii of cinemark</font>

630
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:14,929
holiday mark I was already up here once

631
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:19,759
domestic um uh no caffeine all right

632
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:21,679
south south state apparently um can you

633
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">say anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more about how you're going</font>

634
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:30,199
to rank on ipv4 and a versus a quad a

635
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,539
destination I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if you I</font>

636
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:34,159
mean is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like RTT packet loss I</font>

637
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:36,979
mean how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so</font>

638
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm or if you can't say that's cool too</font>

639
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:41,479
it well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way Akamai decides these</font>

640
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:43,698
things is a complex algorithm which

641
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,379
really comes down to a score and we

642
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,509
literally just have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number and we pick</font>

643
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:49,488
<font color="#CCCCCC">two you know this one or that one but</font>

644
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:52,729
the number is a combination of latency

645
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:53,869
packet loss and throughput the standard

646
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:55,190
stuff if you have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one</font>

647
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:56,599
millisecond but you've only got 500

648
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:59,899
kilobits<font color="#E5E5E5"> and obviously you don't want to</font>

649
00:29:56,599 --> 00:30:01,549
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> path if you have you know 40</font>

650
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,988
milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 50 milliseconds in the</font>

651
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,519
40 milliseconds says ten percent packet

652
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:07,699
loss will pick the fifty percent 50

653
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:10,399
milliseconds etcetera etcetera<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

654
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:11,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">scores is pretty anybody's really</font>

655
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,158
interested in can come talk to me but

656
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,389
it's it's pretty well established and

657
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,009
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the exact same</font>

658
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:17,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm for v6 that we're currently</font>

659
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:19,999
and have been using for v4 for a decade

660
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,729
that was kind of the question on the

661
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:26,179
desk because what we've seen before is

662
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:29,179
you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of preferential ranking of</font>

663
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:30,979
ipv6 for example when resolvers used to

664
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:32,629
choose ipv6 first because we're trying

665
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:34,609
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> boot you know get people to use it</font>

666
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:36,619
right yes but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use the</font>

667
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:38,689
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well that's what we're going to</font>

668
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:40,728
suggest but again whatever our customers

669
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:44,899
tell us to do that's what we're going to

670
00:30:40,729 --> 00:30:47,299
do and the end of day if a customer

671
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:48,738
forces us to do you know v6 only within

672
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:52,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the limitations of the system itself</font>

673
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:53,989
that's what we're going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick</font>

674
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:55,428
cured<font color="#CCCCCC"> launched from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the American you</font>

675
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:57,179
need to come closer do because you scare

676
00:30:55,429 --> 00:31:01,990
me when you

677
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:05,169
I'll scare you later um so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

678
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:07,030
to see if you can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how many of</font>

679
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,549
your how you've been promoting to your

680
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,559
customers and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your customers</font>

681
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:13,690
are actually going to participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

682
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:16,149
ipv6 day because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's one of</font>

683
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key components here of that you know</font>

684
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're giving customers requesting</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">dual stack enabling or enabling just for</font>

686
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,460
the day to get an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sense of</font>

687
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,100
that is going to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of us</font>

688
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,320
understand the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> support queries we're</font>

689
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,449
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if it's you know</font>

690
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">yahoo and google and a few other</font>

691
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,990
providers you know that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

692
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,340
pretty well defined but if everyone

693
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,010
starts having problems with like their

694
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,360
semantic updates you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

695
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you can share those customer names</font>

696
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,459
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would love for you to have the</font>

697
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to pass this up to i sock or</font>

698
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:50,350
someone else we can get an idea of the

699
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,940
scope of the testing can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

700
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:56,439
anything about that what percentage your

701
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,730
customers etc so first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

702
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,210
like the idea of passing the customers

703
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:03,130
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enable v6 on v6 day</font>

704
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,169
two I saw and I will take that back

705
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,280
because honestly that never occurred to

706
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">me and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if marketing is</font>

707
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,139
doing that or not so thank you for that

708
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,080
truth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the matter is very few</font>

709
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,460
customers have asked us before 2010 been

710
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,559
count on one hand the number of

711
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,230
customers who asked us for v6 and we

712
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,570
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000 customers so we're talking</font>

713
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:25,500
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 percent in 2010 that went up</font>

714
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:28,510
slightly it was in the double digits

715
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,039
2011 a few more have asked us but

716
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">honestly one of the reasons that we</font>

717
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:33,820
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full-blown v6 strategy this</font>

718
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment with v6 enabled everywhere and</font>

719
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,418
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing like what bugs and</font>

720
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,370
stuff is because there's very few

721
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,809
customers they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go down to back to</font>

722
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,340
like count on two hands the number of

723
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:43,899
customers that are really pushing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

724
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,490
most of the ones that ask for it they're

725
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,549
kind of like we've heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this v6</font>

726
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:51,700
thing what is that and so we are doing

727
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,750
the opposite we've trained all of our

728
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,919
sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff they're going out and</font>

729
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,110
they're telling customers by the way

730
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,640
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have v6 and we're you</font>

731
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we're we've already</font>

732
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,720
served v6 content but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all testing</font>

733
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,280
from Akamai stuff we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

734
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a dozen customers on what we call</font>

735
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,720
a

736
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,150
tech preview which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like an</font>

737
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,620
early beta and they have to agree that

738
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not going to get mad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us if it</font>

739
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,889
slows things down and stuff like that

740
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,690
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be v6 only host</font>

741
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,890
names but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very soon</font>

742
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:21,530
next 30-45 days<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I'm not sure um</font>

743
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:24,230
but as by the time of v6 day any

744
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:26,990
customer that wants it should be able to

745
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,790
get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to make promises at</font>

746
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,370
a podium in front of 600 my closest

747
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:33,649
friends but theoretically any customer

748
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:36,709
that wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and asks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it and should</font>

749
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,870
be able to have it by v6 day thanks

750
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">Allah thing thank you are you planning</font>

751
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">on keeping the TTL is longer than 24</font>

752
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,740
hours on any of these DNS names the

753
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:50,660
standard Akamai hostname has a 20-second

754

TTL be perfect thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you well it seems</font>

755
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,400
from affiliates um when you say that

756
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,530
things are coming in over tunnels just

757
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">about everyone is coming over tunnels do</font>

758
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:06,350
you mean 2002 / 16 6 24 or do you have

759
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,830
additional secret info about who's

760
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:12,500
running six rd and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're odd</font>

761
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:15,949
six and four tunnel and things like that

762
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be broken and only ten point</font>

763
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:20,120
six percent of them had a native IP

764
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:21,770
address that that's what I know sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

765
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,210
did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't actually do this testing I</font>

766
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,460
asked somebody for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and</font>

767
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,770
they gave me this information I would be

768
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,679
curious to know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little finer</font>

769
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:32,179
detail if you remind me afterwards

770
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,980
because for some reason my brain is not

771
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,980
working very well<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this morning I will</font>

772
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">be happy to look it up for you thanks</font>

773
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,010
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really lot of questions i'm</font>

774
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,010
feeling like i did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not explain things as</font>

775
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:45,890
well so if anybody wants to come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

776
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,120
me afterwards feel free and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess</font>

777
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:49,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it because I don't see anybody if</font>

778
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mike is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jared up there no he's not okay</font>

779
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:52,418
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you everyone</font>

780
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:04,320
okay thank you if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> had any other</font>

781
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,880
follow-up questions I'll just go ahead

782
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,470
and get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the microwave a few more</font>

783
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,130
minutes actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> at one question for</font>

784
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:13,859
Igor if you don't mind this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a Donna</font>

785
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">roizman from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> softlayer could you</font>

786
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,150
describe in a little bit more detail

787
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:21,870
what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing to measure ipv6</font>

788
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:23,940
brokenness for your end users and is

789
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,830
there any information that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

790
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">you or any techniques you can't you have</font>

791
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can make available to other websites</font>

792
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,720
they want to gauge how much broken is

793
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:35,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">their end user base might experience</font>

794
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,310
sure so again i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plug test</font>

795
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:42,140
test ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> com the source code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

796
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:44,759
is actually most of it is open sourced

797
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,370
it's not quite at a point where you can

798
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,970
download it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and quickly integrate it but</font>

799
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,830
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a decent level of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> si skills</font>

800
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:55,980
you can download the source code and

801
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,930
integrate all the testing that it's

802
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:03,150
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Geo web site and then all you</font>

803
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:04,950
do is process logs is that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo is</font>

804
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,680
using to measure brokenness for their

805
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:12,000
visitors we're using that kind of a

806
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:16,350
technique we're not using that code

807
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,150
because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes some time for company</font>

808
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,740
the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo to go through all the</font>

809
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,610
legal channels to open source something

810
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:25,680
so once we figure out the methodology

811
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:29,510
Jason on his own time wrote the code

812
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that test nine TV sitcoms using and a</font>

813
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,290
somebody else wrote the code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo</font>

814
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,150
is using for testing just because the

815
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:39,440
infrastructure that we have in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place you</font>

816
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,440
know is a little different a yahoo

817
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:52,440
the other questions going once<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

818
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,440
looks like we have a

819
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">JC chillin verizon business unit so in</font>

820
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,940
the spirit of trying to get people to

821
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,829
adopt ipv6 sooner rather than later

822
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:08,150
which i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is the goal of world ipv6</font>

823
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:09,799
day what do you tell n sites and transit

824
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:13,519
providers that have a strategy of

825
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">planning to support ipv6 when they need</font>

826
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:16,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">to in other words when they believe</font>

827
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:24,109
they're going to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of before</font>

828
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:30,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses tell them that as of Thursday</font>

829
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:30,759
I Anna will have 0 / aids that's a rumor

830
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:37,578
no but the point I'm trying to make is

831
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:40,058
there are many transit providers and

832
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:42,410
many of their customers that have a

833
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:44,450
mentality that they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

834
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">do ipv6 until they're forced to and</font>

835
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,980
they're not really forced to until they

836
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,680
themselves run out of available via for

837
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,680
addresses so especially n sites that

838
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,399
have a population<font color="#CCCCCC"> of users that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

839
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,200
growing many of them say why do I need

840
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do v6 and why do I need to do it now</font>

841
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:07,118
that's from so as Igor just whispered to

842
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:10,329
me that the problem is they don't and

843
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,950
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no reason for them if you have</font>

844
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,059
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have X number of IP addresses in</font>

845
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,700
your hosting provider and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

846
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:18,410
growing or if you're going slow enough

847
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to let the equipment swap out keep the</font>

848
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">same number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses and support it</font>

849
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,079
unfortunately the answer is you don't

850
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:28,480
need to do v6 before is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

851
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:31,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">around for a very very very long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so</font>

852
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,049
what we do what I do personally is I

853
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:34,430
beat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drum and everybody up here is</font>

854
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:36,319
beating the drum we did this on our own

855
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,118
time and we're here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know talking to</font>

856
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:40,730
600 of are not so closest<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends trying</font>

857
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,200
to get everybody to do v6 this is

858
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,059
despite<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that you know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

859
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pleased to be six but we all want</font>

860
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:47,989
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen end of day they're going to</font>

861
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,629
be pockets of v4 forever and ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

862
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:52,789
all we can do is get get over the hump

863
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,489
if we can get enough v6 out there that

864
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,989
v4 is the minority then maybe they'll

865
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:58,489
change even if they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and if</font>

866
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:01,779
they don't then they'll just suffer the

867
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:01,779
performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other consequences</font>

868
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:07,410
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say a couple words on that</font>

869
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:10,299
front as well what we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been saying to</font>

870
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:12,629
companies in that position is largely

871
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:14,650
even if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to change your</font>

872
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,510
networks for your purposes because

873
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:21,039
you've got enough address space there

874
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:23,380
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more v6 only in in the world so</font>

875
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,839
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be people trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach you</font>

876
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,559
starting from a v6 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> network because</font>

877
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,319
there are growing networks elsewhere

878
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:35,020
that's not really compelling in the

879
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:36,599
immediate business cycle but it is at

880
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:40,150
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pointer to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long term</font>

881
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,789
reasoning here I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it does</font>

882
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,230
anything for companies making a decision

883
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:47,079
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether to try to come play in</font>

884
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,480
world ipv6 day I do hope that some of

885
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:51,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stats</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we collect then we'll</font>

886
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,849
start to paint a more compelling picture

887
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:56,680
about the reality of v6 in the future

888
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:59,859
but none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> short term argument</font>

889
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,009
I mean the reality is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

890
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:07,869
ipv4 is going to be with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> for at least</font>

891
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:10,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 years and probably 20 plus so for the</font>

892
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:13,140
next year if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have v6 in their</font>

893
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,809
planning cycle and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not growing</font>

894
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:18,700
you know okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> just please try not to</font>

895
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:22,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">break people who are doing tunnels or</font>

896
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:25,629
whatnot remember X dot 25 and PDP 11s

897
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:32,020
are still in production so second and

898
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:35,349
they don't support ipv6 hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> again masato</font>

899
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:37,809
yamanishi of<font color="#E5E5E5"> japan tocome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> america I'm</font>

900
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:40,270
afraid many thing will happen on ipv6

901
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:43,180
day actually so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

902
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the impact of this day and in yahoo</font>

903
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:49,328
presentation you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> D'Alessio or</font>

904
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,950
broken user is decreasing is the measure

905
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:57,309
on side door of the fu or measure on

906
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:58,779
wwe.com so the measurement is actually

907
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:00,400
there's two different measurements by

908
00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:04,619
two different people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm quoting</font>

909
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,619
i'm not saying yahoo numbers there

910
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:09,829
Lorenzo from google

911
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:12,589
has posted their numbers and also Tory

912
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:15,230
Anderson from Norway the two numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

913
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:16,910
so close that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> choose up different</font>

914
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,829
measurements that are measuring the

915
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,430
world that have basically the same stats

916
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:27,519
and it's between point 0 to 6 and point

917
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:29,690
0 to four percent it's fluctuating so I

918
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,189
look out here and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font>

919
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming to Nana four dozen years and</font>

920
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:35,960
stuff and the number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Macintoshes has</font>

921
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,640
grown and grown and grown and there's

922
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,589
still only twenty percent or less of the

923
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,990
market and they are something like

924
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:48,259
eighty percent of the brokenness ipv6 so

925
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:51,558
so get them to fix it so they fix quite

926
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:55,009
a bit thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple and select people</font>

927
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:59,599
with an apple with the very latest 10 10

928
00:41:55,009 --> 00:42:01,460
dot 6 update the very nasty bug of 64

929
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,950
and RFC 1918 addresses has been fixed

930
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that alone dropped the brokenness</font>

931
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:10,189
from point 05 12 point over 26 just that

932
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:12,890
one fix alone but many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> block on</font>

933
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:17,119
user problem will happen from the

934
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:21,558
combination of isp used on it for user

935
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:23,539
equipment cpe like that so fixing each

936
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:25,819
device doesn't dissolve the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

937
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:27,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">think yes you need to fix like i said</font>

938
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix all the bugs and</font>

939
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:33,799
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are very afraid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of is</font>

940
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,960
that those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stats with users with</font>

941
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:41,180
0 point two percent of the users who

942
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:43,309
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 like turned on so something</font>

943
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,808
we've been thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

944
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:47,869
didn't want to bury my hand in the sand

945
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:51,739
but the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really if the</font>

946
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:54,019
percentage of users for v6 enabled is is

947
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:56,989
the percentage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users or v6 enable</font>

948
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:59,450
really point two to six percent and one

949
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:02,299
in 10 of the v6 aware users are actually

950
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:04,788
broken and if there's more ipv6 aware

951
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:07,579
users is one is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be more</font>

952
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:09,230
broken users or if we can drop the

953
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:11,930
number of broken users while increasing

954
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,960
the number of working users so is also

955
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">um sorry Jer one just remember everybody</font>

956
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

957
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,909
are so

958
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:21,079
broken that they can't get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be six but</font>

959
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:22,429
we're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> us somebody who</font>

960
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,679
thinks they're going to be it on v6 and

961
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:26,599
then they timeout 60 90 120 seconds

962
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:28,749
later because as far as the user is

963
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:32,029
concerned 100 20-second timeout is down

964
00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:33,919
so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have v6 or if your v6 is</font>

965
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:36,319
so broken that you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even ask for a</font>

966
00:43:33,919 --> 00:43:37,578
quad a or something like that then

967
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,279
you're actually not a problem to us

968
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:41,689
right now we're worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

969
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:43,219
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a quad I think they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get to a</font>

970
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:44,899
quad I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to a quad a and then</font>

971
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:47,319
wait around while the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets pissed</font>

972
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:53,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">off and spills coffee on their machine</font>

973
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:55,130
so so so Igor this is Jared again so one

974
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:59,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the concerns that I have in setting</font>

975
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:01,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> threshold where it is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

976
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:03,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're stating that it needs to be</font>

977
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:06,229
pointed one percent of the user is being

978
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:09,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">broken I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said at the very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least we know</font>

979
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:11,569
one is that the one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> fat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wish we</font>

980
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:15,049
could get security patch levels at that

981
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:17,149
high of a level within organizations I'm

982
00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:22,130
sorry Patrick who almost spilled coffee

983
00:44:17,149 --> 00:44:23,868
across all the attendees but trying to

984
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">aim for such a low threshold of</font>

985
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:28,819
brokenness I think is actually quite

986
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:31,130
possibly an unreasonable expectation and

987
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:33,049
outstanding idea will create a botnet

988
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:36,289
that infects all the users and fixes

989
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:38,419
their v6 if only<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could create a</font>

990
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:41,049
botnet to turn on automatic patching on

00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:43,038
people's windows machines as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately there's various laws and</font>

00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,599

that which might be effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font>

995

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any be six or before</font>

998
00:44:54,289 --> 00:45:00,949
is security<font color="#E5E5E5"> of n hosts isn't actually</font>

00:44:57,439 --> 00:45:03,589
impacting the business isn't perceived

1000
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:06,169
to be impacting the business of major

1001
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:09,229
content providers whereas the business

1002
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:10,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision makers are stopped by the</font>

00:45:09,229 --> 00:45:12,769
perception that they are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1004
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:15,138
breaking their service for a percentage

<font color="#E5E5E5">of their customers and unfortunately</font>

1006
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:19,519
we're not the room that gets to decide

1007
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,239
what that percentage is so I mean I

1008
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:26,629
certainly take your point I'm with you

1009
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:28,399
but to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in my slide if v6 isn't</font>

1010

1013
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly understand that that reality</font>

1014
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:38,109
and part of that is us taking the

1015
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:39,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">lessons that we know here technical</font>

information back in educating the people

1017
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:46,019
in our organizations and saying look you

1018
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:48,160
know some amount of brokenness

1019
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:49,808
ultimately happens there's lots of

1020
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,950
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who can't reach the internet</font>

1021

vile effects google and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yahoo and and</font>

1025
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,369
that that affects everyone equally

1026
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:09,369
exactly the this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of v6 day</font>

1027
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:12,099
is to affect everyone equally absolutely

1030
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,210

bit directly a little bit more directly

1032
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:24,009
I myself believe that this or if you had

1033
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:27,009
asked me six months ago what I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font>

you this threshold isn't point 01<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:36,430
get to need perfectly fine over ipv4 and

1037
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,259
now i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I'm going to do</font>

1038
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:41,799
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stops them from getting</font>

1039
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:45,130
to me I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wrong and for a</font>

1040
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:47,440
certain percentage like one in one in a

hundred thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know I've</font>

1042
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,160
impacted fifteen thousand users globally

1043
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:57,460
that's bad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no those guys will have</font>

1044
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,868
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some workarounds but 156,000</font>

1045
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:03,309

1046
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:06,609
we should be handing<font color="#CCCCCC"> out qua days that's</font>

1047
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:08,890
a problem so the same argument could be

1048
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:11,619
made though for<font color="#CCCCCC"> bc p38 compliance by</font>

1049
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:13,269
turning on unicast RPF people break out

1050
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:15,460
a variety of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand that</font>

1051
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:17,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're not directly equated to each</font>

other but in setting where you're

1053
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:22,239
actually placing that decimal point has

1054
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,488
a significant impact obviously on the

1055

<font color="#CCCCCC">people be so broken and yet still work</font>

retarding the adoption of ipv6 in a

1066
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:55,700
number of markets so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that</font>

1067

<font color="#CCCCCC">we will not do dual stack with the</font>

current brokenness numbers I am saying

<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's no way in hell that we will</font>

00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:04,849
important point of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just said</font>

1072
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:08,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">jared was in comparison it to be cd38</font>

1073
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:09,680
the context there is this is not just

1074
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:12,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question what is the public good but</font>

1075
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:16,190
also belief in the value of the outcome

1076

of deploying bcp to adhering<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp 38</font>

1077
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:20,450
and implicitly then what we're saying

1078
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,879
here is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't the business</font>

1079
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:25,180
perceived value in deploying ipv6 yet

1080
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:29,720
which comes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason's questions so</font>

1081
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:31,399
another side goal of world ipv6 day and

1082
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:34,459
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're doing this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

1083
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,230
with ipv6 is to try to demonstrate that

1084
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,109
you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more momentum behind</font>

1085
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,630
ipv6 so that at some point the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1086
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:43,069
perceived value of supporting ipv6 will

1087
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,829
indeed outweigh whatever particular

1088
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:48,529
numbers because the way the way that

1089
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:51,589
Igor phrased it was he can't turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on</font>

1090
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:54,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he thinks it's right so we need</font>

1091
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:57,799
to get more business support for the

thank you very much that is how we're

measuring so when v4 starts to work

1108
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,069
worse then the brokenness number will

1109

look

surveys done this morning so later on

1137
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:50,839
today we can go ahead and draw the name

1138
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:53,930
for a brand new juniper ax series switch

1139

who's going to speak to us about DNS SEC

1147
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:21,940
you have you

1148
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:24,780
yeah i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fit all</font>

1149
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,780
differently to change

1150
00:51:55,290 --> 00:52:02,910
right ah good morning everyone I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean</font>

1151
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:05,970
and I'm not a morning person especially

1152
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:07,950
after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome party last night back</font>

1153
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:09,750
home and Singapore I'm probably waking

1154
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:12,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">or thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about making up around</font>

1155
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:15,210
ten-thirty in the morning so I'm a

1156
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:17,280
systems admin for Mozilla and we

1157
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:21,270
implemented DNS SEC for Mozilla a dog

1158
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:25,070
towards the end of 2010 and just thought

1159
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:28,950
i'd share my experience with you guys uh

1160
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:32,310
just a little intro to mozilla we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1161
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:34,589
we help make firefox which is the second

1162
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:36,779
most popular browser in the world we've

1163
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:39,450
got about 400 million users today which

1164
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">is coincidentally also the number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

Sunday by mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright the reason i ask</font>

1174
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,650
that is the first part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the talk is</font>

1175
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to cover</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the basics of DNS</font>

1176
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:21,600
SEC if you're at the tutorial you would

1177
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:23,460
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> already heard most of this then we</font>

1178
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,920
go on to some of the implementation

1179
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">details and the mistakes you should not</font>

00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">be making when you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about DNS</font>

1181
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:35,250
SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what exactly is DNS SEC</font>

1182
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,529
v NS security extensions a bunch of

1183
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,300
changes to DNS that ensures that your

1184
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:41,550
data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps you ensure that your</font>

1185
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:44,790
data hasn't changed in transit that

1186
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:46,500
helps you validate the source and does

1187
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,990
something called authenticated denial of

1188
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,300
existence which basically means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1189
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:53,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a surefire way of saying or knowing</font>

1190
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:57,000
that a subdomain or domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

1191
00:53:53,460 --> 00:54:01,320
exist the arishok is based on public key

1192
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,420
cryptography RFC's 40 33 34 and 35 are

1193
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,130
the core documents that actually

1194
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:08,580
describe it along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

1195
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:10,320
supplementary RFC's if you're new to<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

1196
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:12,569
the Wikipedia article is an excellent

1197
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">place to start some of these concepts</font>

1198
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:16,200
can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little complex but once he</font>

1199
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:19,890
wants to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your head</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around it it's</font>

1200
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,080
pretty simple to work through it why DNS

1201
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:24,569
SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> because well DNS is an excellent</font>

1202
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,480
system scales<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well but it wasn't</font>

1203
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:30,120
created for today's world so we've seen

1204
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,310
issues with pns security attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1205
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,230
cache poisoning for example and

1206
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:38,549
hopefully DNS SEC will help mitigate

1207
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:43,110
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so what exactly is</font>

1208
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:45,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">new in DNS SEC RFC 4034 explains these</font>

1209
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:48,840
new for new resource records that we

1210
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:52,259
have I'll just run through them a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

1211
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,030
key is nothing but so since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA is</font>

1212
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,040
based on public key cryptography you've

1213
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:58,740
got a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> key that you stored away</font>

1214
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,980
safely and a public key that's disputed

1215
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,720
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns key record basically holds</font>

1216
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,300
your public key that's it it's very

1217
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple it holds your public key the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> S</font>

1218
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,580
record or a delegation signer record is

1219
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,070
an interesting record because a d/s

1220
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:17,279
record actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing but a pointer</font>

1221
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:19,740
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS key record it sits in a pet in</font>

1222
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,440
your parents on and contains something

1223
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:25,979
called a<font color="#E5E5E5"> key tag or a key ID that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1224
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:28,350
uniquely a link to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your key and has a</font>

1225
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,780
hash of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key and sits in the parent</font>

1226
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:33,600
zone so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a d/s record for</font>

1227
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,930
mozilla.org would be in dot org will

1228
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:39,060
point to a specific key in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mozilla.org</font>

1229
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:43,049
that and that's basically what he s

1230
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:46,710
record is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> N Secord is basically</font>

1231
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:49,470
called next secure this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what helps</font>

1232
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:53,010
with the authenticated denial of

1233
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:57,689
existence say for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you do a</font>

1234
00:55:53,010 --> 00:56:00,390
lookup for<font color="#E5E5E5"> bargard mozilla.org and such</font>

1235
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:02,940
domain does not exist an encyclical will

1236
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:06,540
reply with well the next secure record

1237
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:08,610
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> food or mozilla.org and so the</font>

1238
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insect was that you could</font>

1239
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually run queries and find out all</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing domains which you cannot</font>

1241
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:17,520
do with DNS but you could do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NSX and that is why they came up with</font>

00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing but the</font>

1245
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:25,319
difference being the names are hashed so

1246
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,848
you could still technically walk the

1247
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:29,400
tree find out demands but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1248
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:31,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get hash names and so you can't</font>

1249
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,299
really make much sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it's a</font>

1250
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:37,019
lot indicates that that domain doesn't

00:56:33,299 --> 00:56:39,630
exist<font color="#CCCCCC"> and others say god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Secord</font>

1252
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:41,700

1253
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,769
as the tube or this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what actually</font>

verified not created diagrams but I

1256
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:54,959
would sort of look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dsdna</font>

1264
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:21,029
since it's based on public key

1265
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,859
cryptography as I've said we've had we

1266
00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:24,180
have public and private<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys you stored</font>

1267
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:26,788
away the private key safely you

1268
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:29,879
distribute the public keys you've got

1269
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:33,539
two types of keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> key signing keys as</font>

1270
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,489
the name implies sign other keys and so

1271
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:37,650
on signing keys signs owns the key

1272
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:41,390
signing key<font color="#E5E5E5"> also signs the zone signing</font>

1273
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:44,670
key now in theory we do not actually

1274
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:46,499
need multiple keys you could do DNS SEC

1275
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:48,569
with just one key but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1276
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:51,499
operational reasons as to why you would

1277
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:54,239
like different keys as I said all your

1278
00:57:51,499 --> 00:57:57,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I spoke about the D s and D s</font>

1283
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,479
you're going to have to contact your

1284

parent and change that<font color="#CCCCCC"> D s eckerd every</font>

1285
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:14,189
time and this this could possibly cause

1286
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,569
a break in your chain of authentication

1287
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:18,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show you the chain of</font>

1289
00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:23,069
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to split your</font>

1290
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,219

<font color="#CCCCCC">reason is zone signing keys can be</font>

lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on signing key it's easy you</font>

1294
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:33,569
can just change it your key signing key

1295
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:33,819
will sign the zone signing key and you

1296
00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:35,769
know

1297
00:58:33,819 --> 00:58:38,170
you don't lose your chain of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust at</font>

1298
00:58:35,769 --> 00:58:41,038
all there are a bunch of algorithms that

1299
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:43,329
you can use to generate your keys but

1300
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,249
without going into too much detail the

1301
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:47,739
most commonly<font color="#CCCCCC"> used ones are probably</font>

00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:56,170
with the hash of sha-1 and there's seven

00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:58,869
of it RSA sha-1 and sexy I guess uh what

is it all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll over is a process of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you generate keys once and you keep</font>

1308

signing forever up that's kind of not

1309
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:11,859
the idea so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have rollovers value</font>

the operational practices RFC 4641 is an

1329
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:16,860
that will explain the relationships

1333
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:25,560
first so that's basically what it looks

1334
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,900
like this is an excellent tool from the

1335

actually runs through the whole chain of

01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,620
trust as you can see it goes from dot to

1338
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,930
dot org to mozilla the dog verifies the

1339
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:40,710
whole chain that this record is actually

1340
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:45,710
valid if you expand it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little further</font>

1341
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:50,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll skip right down to this part where</font>

1342
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:55,380
it says org refers to mozilla.org for

1343
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">mozilla dog 1bs record fond and comes</font>

1344
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:59,520
down here says checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> d s so this this</font>

1345
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:03,470
is basically a d/s record that sits in

1346
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:06,840
the parent domain checks the<font color="#E5E5E5"> d/s record</font>

1347
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:10,439
over here which basically says<font color="#CCCCCC"> in d s</font>

1348
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:14,580
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key tag 518 you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1349
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:18,150
corresponding<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS key here 5 16 18 as</font>

1350
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:21,900
well and then it continues down it finds

1351
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:28,640
that this D s verifies the DNS key finds

1352
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:30,900
to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> 66 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 879 is the zone signing key</font>

1353
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,960
comes further down this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one signing</font>

1354
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:38,450
key actually signs that are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1355
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,450
so it verifies that record

1356
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:48,260
uh-huh so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before you actually</font>

1357
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,990
do the NS sec it's good if you check

1358
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:54,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that your top-level domain is sign it's</font>

1359
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:56,779
not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a must-have it's a good to</font>

1360
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:58,640
have thing because this means that you

1361
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:00,530
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw in the previous slide it's</font>

1362
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,629
you have a complete chain of trust if

1363
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:04,100
you don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then you're something</font>

1364
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:06,470
called an island of trust which means

01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're separate the root is separate</font>

1366
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:10,879
there's no real link there are other

the only entity right now that can

1376
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:34,910
update your das records so they have to

1377
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:37,880
be DNS SEC compliant or be in a position

1378
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:39,080
to actually update<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs records I say you</font>

1379
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,230
might have to poke a bit because

1380
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,580
sometimes they say for example if you

1381
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:45,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at GoDaddy they've got a web</font>

interface you just put in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dias</font>

1383
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,010
records you're good some other registers

1384
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:50,990
you're going to have to email your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dias</font>

1385
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:53,060
records to them and make sure they

1386
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:55,549
update it so if the process is still

1387
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:58,390
sort of you know in flux it depends the

1388
01:02:55,550 --> 01:03:01,460
URL there actually gives a list of

01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,229
testing or whatever DNS servers you use

1393
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:15,470
bind unbound both of them actually

1394
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:18,230
support DNS SEC look at key signing

1395
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:20,720
software like Open DNS SEC figure out if

1396
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:24,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to be useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do your</font>

testing before you go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah this is</font>

1398
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:30,230
what our setup looks like it's a pretty

1399
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,089
simple setup you've got our<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS configs</font>

1400
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:34,250
go to source control get pulled on by

1401
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:36,710
the name servers and being sad means

1402
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:39,110
we're pretty lazy about stuff so you

1403
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:41,570
don't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you have saina machine</font>

1404
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:43,640
which actually holds your keys sysadmin

1405
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:45,590
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> commit the source control the sign</font>

1406
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,359
of machine does<font color="#CCCCCC"> the signing which is</font>

1407
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:49,750
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> into source control which then</font>

1408
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:53,950
filters down the name servers

1409
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:56,020
a bunch of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

1410
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:58,450
into too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much detail here so key gen is</font>

1411
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:00,910
basically what generates are the keys

1412
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:03,430
for you I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> highlight the minus</font>

1413
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:05,890
f KS k that is what denotes set

1414
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:08,049
something called an<font color="#E5E5E5"> S et bit at a secure</font>

1415
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:10,240
entry point bit that is what denotes a

1416
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:13,090
key signing key and says this is

1417
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">different from other keys if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

1418
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:18,160
add that the second line right there

1419
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:19,810
that's basically a zone sign key set

1420
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,359
time you can have multiple keys you can

1421
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:23,560
decide when they go active and stuff

1422
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,870
like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what it's used for</font>

1423
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:28,180
signs on is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually does your</font>

1424
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:30,580
signing the minus s there is important

1425
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:32,020
because it's a cool feature it's called

1426
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:33,819
smart signing it looks at your whole

1427
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:36,490
list of keys it decides what keys

1428
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:39,160
expired when what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> active signs your</font>

1429
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:40,959
zones according to that and that's those

1430
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,870
are the changes you make to bind that

1431
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:46,720
car named<font color="#CCCCCC"> at conf enable yes validation</font>

1432
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:49,330
es point to assign zone file you should

1433
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,430
be good this at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you are</font>

1434
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:53,230
serving sign zones if you want to be

1435
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:56,700
evaluating resolver you'll have to add

1436
01:04:53,230 --> 01:05:01,420
either manage keys and point to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

1437
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:04,779
trust stuff or atrocities that should

01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:06,550
work steps to do things that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we'd</font>

1439
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:10,300
be upgraded bind<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the board</font>

1441
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:15,610
this six wasn't out yet it was still

1442
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:19,240
beta but yeah kick off the signers DNS

1443

1444
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:24,069
gonna skip this for now I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I think</font>

1445
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,840
we're a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> short on time so i'll</font>

1446
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:28,930
come back to showing you some commands

1447
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:36,990
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> i take questions this is another</font>

1448
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:40,180
excellent tool from sandia national labs

1449
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:42,490
this is basically again beautifully

1450
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:44,350
shows the whole authentication chain as

1451
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:46,120
you can see right from the root i'm not

1452
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if yeah you can still read that so</font>

1453
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:52,180
that's that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes dns key</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">then finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signed stuff so this is</font>

1461
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:15,190
this is really useful for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure</font>

01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that your stuff is correctly set up and</font>

1463
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:19,390
working as you can see it shows you the

1467
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,920
be careful about your keys and

<font color="#CCCCCC">everything protect them you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

to be losing your keys are getting into

1470
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:39,730
all sorts of trouble make sure you have

1471
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:41,740
a backup plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> both at the deployment</font>

1472
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:43,930
stage and four scenarios later what

01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,879
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> if someone breaks into a sign a</font>

1474

01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,740
accidentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> loose pop private keys</font>

1476
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:53,140
these are situations you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plan</font>

1477
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,700
for because with DNS SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run the</font>

1478
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:57,580

1481
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,280
and if there's a problem in the

1482
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:05,290
validation chain right now today it's

1483
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:09,550
not an issue but eventually in the

1484
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:11,650
future at some point if the the chain is

1485
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:15,010
broken then yours ones are completely

1486
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:17,140
unreachable always sign zones publish

1487
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:19,900
the ones and then push your dsl<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eckard's</font>

1488
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:22,060
at least for the first time it's it's

01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty crucial note that your network</font>

1490
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:27,340

01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:29,410
where our cisco and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

1493
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:36,009
guy but yeah we had issues where DNS SEC

1494
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,360
increases the amount of data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1499
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:52,750
security lameness<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did the reverse</font>

1500
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:55,210
about what happened was I sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

we'd like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> push thought I expected</font>

1506
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:10,630
the first 12 was and well so we were in

1507
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,800
sign for a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as soon as the d/s</font>

goes out

1509
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,210
validating resolvers look at the d/s and

1510
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:18,220
say hey we expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NS key for</font>

the default log levels in buying for DNS

SEC are set to debug we filled up this

1517
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:35,910
pretty fast in like less than a week so

1518
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:39,460
you might want to watch out for that and

1519
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:42,639
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it of course Twitter everyone</font>

01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:59,620
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> not too yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on fixing that</font>

1525
01:08:53,950 --> 01:09:01,779
pretty soon moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure this</font>

1526
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:03,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">is sort of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chicken and egg thing just</font>

1529
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:10,270
enough clients that actually use them so

1530
01:09:08,529 --> 01:09:11,979
we looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from the perspective of</font>

1531
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:14,620
let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and implement this</font>

1532
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:15,818
because this is good and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

1533
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:18,729
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it in that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way as well</font>

1534
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:21,520
because well you know more security more

1535
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:23,080
win for the users from a Firefox

1536
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,310
perspective although this is not an

1537
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,439
official position there's been

1538
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:29,799
discussion within the IT team that we

1539
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:32,410
should have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS eck validator inside</font>

1540
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:34,630
Firefox that for example checks are

1541
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:37,180
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs make sure that you don't</font>

1542
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:38,920
depend on the OS the browser itself will

1543
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:41,230
actually validate where it's connecting

1544
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,370
to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get its updates there was someone</font>

1545
01:09:41,229 --> 01:09:44,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">here who is speaking to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday</font>

1546
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:46,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">today should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they've actually</font>

1547
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:49,660
have a patch that they plan to submit to

1548
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:51,189
Mozilla to actually have a DNS SEC

1549
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:54,040
validation in the browser so that's

1550
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:57,969
pretty awesome and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have</font>

1551
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:59,740
graphs ah the first graph is actually

1552
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:02,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of queries we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do</font>

1553
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:04,330
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hector in the last week so it's</font>

1554
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:05,590
sort of you know still in flux but

1555
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:07,990
that's the number of queries we do a

1556
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:10,660
minute the second graph next to that is

1557
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:13,660
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones DNS the second one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is bns</font>

1558
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:16,660
sec and as you can see the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font>

1559
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:18,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">missing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> que so it's it's basically</font>

1560
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,030
nothing third graph combines both DNS

1561
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:22,190
SEC is just

1562
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:27,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">line down there really really</font>

1563
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:30,619
