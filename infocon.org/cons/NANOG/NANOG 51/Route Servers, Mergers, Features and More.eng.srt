I

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,090
route servers it's a interesting subject

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,070
for IX peas in particular and for many

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:23,119
of you who are our members he certainly

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">seemed to like them but when you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2i</font>

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,220
group of i Iook speeds in a given region

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,550
that merged together it creates

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,290
challenges in terms of well what route

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,580
servers are you going to deploy or what

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,010
router servers are going to keep and

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:45,620
maybe you start all over and you have a

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:50,110
whole new concept so what drives it you

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:52,760
have these<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs or most of us do that</font>

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,719
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put together if we're going</font>

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,629
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate our exchanges and in some</font>

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,829
cities where you have large IXPs merging

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,200
together they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to merge their</font>

19
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">VLANs and do funky things having a</font>

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,750
constant or consistent peering VLAN and

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:10,699
consistent route service is important so

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,720
what platforms are out there there's

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,780
quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> route servers that are</font>

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">available and I didn't list the hardware</font>

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,490
vendor base rough servers that are

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:22,220
coming out you know right now really

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">cisco has a beta out there and I know</font>

43
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,990
working on the route servers has been as

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> add more features to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your route</font>

71
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,280
some ISPs actually have portals where

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,170
you can go in and specifically allow

00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:37,060
to for the members so that they can more

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,610
easily manipulate the connections and

77
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,520
the pass on the on the route server

78
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,160

79
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,440
seen moving forward has been multi rib

83
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,970
can choose if they want to be on the

84

87
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,200
easily not accept that is those routes

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,900
into that rib and not advertise their

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,540
routes back out to certain peers ribs as

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,340
well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a that's a feature that</font>

91
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:15,549
we've seen a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of requests for so</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit down</font>

97
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,310
and analyze what features you need from

your<font color="#CCCCCC"> out servers because a lot of times</font>

99
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,030
you may get one number or two members

100
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,550
would say we want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and the</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you need to really sit down and</font>

104
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,760
see how much development time is going

105
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,159
to be taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get certain features out</font>

106
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,380
there and getting all this information

107
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">before you start implementing your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

108
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,900
servers is very useful and then choosing

109
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">a route server software with so many</font>

110
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:01,700
variations out there not everyone uses

111
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,190
the same same platform for example

112
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Equinix of uses in the Equinix classic</font>

113
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,060
markets uses open<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP d but in the</font>

114
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,510
switch and data<font color="#CCCCCC"> classic markets we use</font>

115
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,990
bird so that's that's one example in

116
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:18,409
Europe it's significantly different

117
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,880
there's reasons why each given ISP

118
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,190
chooses to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the platform</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

119
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,190
they want and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times it's a</font>

120
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,170
personal preference and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then to go dive</font>

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,610

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">your route servers this is you know</font>

124
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes your IT group and a larger</font>

126
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,560
they might only support linux or they

00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,060
might open only<font color="#E5E5E5"> support freebsd or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what-have-you so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a limited</font>

129
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,230
choice well that definitely has a

130
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,820
ramification on<font color="#E5E5E5"> route server which route</font>

131
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,650
server software you can run if you can

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use Linux you really don't want to</font>

134
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:57,710
well so so that's there there's and you

135
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,739
get into on certain kernel versions what

136
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:03,289
have you issues with md5 and TTL

137
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,080
security so not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you need to dive</font>

138
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,550
into what<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating systems you're going</font>

139
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,620
to run what kernel versions you're going

140
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,570
to do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will have a direct effect</font>

141
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:16,970
on what route server software you can

142
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:19,070
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> deploy so as we're talking</font>

143
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">about security that there's there's a</font>

144
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,980
lot that goes into it md5 is a feature

203
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,310
you is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trust that you want us to</font>

204
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,259
have is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feature that you really</font>

205
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,489
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain if not</font>

206

it certainly makes our life a lot easier

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,969
so OSS use<font color="#CCCCCC"> I covered it briefly openbsd</font>

212
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,839
or you can hack the bejesus out of it

213
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,740
and make a current version work but

214

doesn't scale very well but the one

266
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,059
thing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have learned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we</font>

267
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,939
can't not have route servers because

it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> competitive disadvantage and many</font>

00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,380
ways they both work fairly well given

283
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:29,329
given the logistics of the auto

314
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,519
is the threading openpgp d runs three

317
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:54,069
bird handles it all with one it's not

318
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,720
multi-threaded but it has a

319
00:13:54,069 --> 00:14:01,179
significantly superior scheduling system

320
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,699

single process arguably significantly

322
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:10,899
faster than open<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP DS multi-threaded</font>

and it actually runs two separate

327

338
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:56,529
it's it's learning curve the the syntax

339
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,059
is significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> different than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

340

like open<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp d its just its own thing</font>

343
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:07,809
and the way that you have to replicate

00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,759
certain functions in order to get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

346
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,490
that what have you

347
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,700
there's oftentimes a lot of duplication

348
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:19,000
of config that goes between to add in

349
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,740
there to make everything work great so

350
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,790
I'm gonna read everything there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

351
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:28,360
of stuff up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there test cases so for open</font>

updates for md5 with a standard filters

354
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:38,740
that one definitely failed this is open

<font color="#CCCCCC">bheegi bheegi 4.5 so 4.8 would be a lot</font>

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what we've seen if you if you're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">for these tests I will gladly share that</font>

363
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:03,280
afternoon after the presentation with

364
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:07,390
you but in some cases it's actually kind

365
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:10,350
of convoluted in complex and how we

366
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:13,240
actually drive their test cases for bird

367
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:17,080
it it pretty much passes with flying

368
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,930
colors in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways we could because</font>

369
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a far more active development</font>

370
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:25,150
group that's involved with bird we can

371
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,560
if we if we've seen a problem a bug or

372
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">what have you we can pass it to the bird</font>

373
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,119
developers and generally within 24 to 48

374
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,860
hours we get a patch back that that

375
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,100
that's you know poured it into the git

376
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,050
tree and then at 125 we had a bunch that

377
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,840
that made it in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have a</font>

378
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:43,930
bunch in 13 that are in there that will

379
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,180
when 13 is released so the development

380
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,520
the development staff at bird is amazing

381
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,819
in terms of responsiveness to get to get

382
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,960
issues fixed so as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see our</font>

383
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:58,530
results are significantly better for

384
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:01,510
bird but like anything there's politics

385
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,890
so when you get money when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have two</font>

386
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,660
companies or two exchanges or what have

387
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:08,020
you merge together there's you know

388
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,209
oftentimes difficulties with figuring

389
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,740
out who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run the process of</font>
