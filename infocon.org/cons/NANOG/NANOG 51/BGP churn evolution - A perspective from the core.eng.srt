00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,349
hi there my name is Ahmed in question

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,040
I'm a PhD student similar research

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:22,050
laboratory in Norway so I'm presenting a

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:27,029
joint work with my supervisor i'ma

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:30,570
travel plan and constant intervals we

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically studying the evolution of PTP</font>

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:41,400
dynamics so as we know the size of the

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet has grown tremendously during</font>

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,420
the past decade so here I show like two

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:52,589
matrix which are more relevant to the

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,830
writing system<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the left we have the</font>

13
00:00:52,589 --> 00:01:01,970
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of edges and how that has</font>

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:04,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">increased between 2003 and 2010 so we</font>

15
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:09,270
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decrease of hundred and four six</font>

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,658
percent during this period to the right

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,289
we show the size of the DMZ routing

18
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,659
table do the same period we see an

19
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:22,530
increase of one hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty-eight</font>

20
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:27,179
percent so this data from Rowdies of

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:30,840
course I mean this growth figures a lot

22
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:36,409
of concern about the scalability of the

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:40,369
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing architecture so a</font>

24
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:46,170
workshop or rallying and addressing

25
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:50,009
organized by the IAB in 2007 concluded

26
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,799
that routing scalability is the most

27
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:56,219
important challenge that's facing the

28
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,840
current architecture and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font>

29
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:05,158
up with a new a new scale of reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,550
addressing architecture to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of solve</font>

31
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this problem so why we need to come up</font>

32
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,030
with that and why is scalability the

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,890
problem one reason just DF 0 that

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,480
increases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DFG a shot in the last</font>

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide and we know the reasons hear more</font>

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,010
terming the aggregation of prefixes

37
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:32,750
provided independent addressing and thus

38
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:36,319
the second reason is a churn<font color="#E5E5E5"> pgp</font>

39
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:39,760
dynamics so what do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean by sharing</font>

40
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,548
here you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that p-gp is incremental</font>

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,950
so whenever allowed changes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> riata</font>

42
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:49,069
would inform his<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbors of that</font>

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,518
change and you need to process those

44
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:55,790
messages timely to avoid prolonged<font color="#E5E5E5"> con</font>

45
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:00,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">variance and to avoid impact on data</font>

46
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:06,078
delivery so our work here focus on the

47
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">second issue sure so that's its</font>

48
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:11,900
potential threat but the first question

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,700
that comes to mind is what is the

50
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:21,230
current status so in fact churn is very

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:25,369
complex and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its interplay of several</font>

52
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:30,980
factors so we know very little about

53
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:35,540
overall picture an earlier study by

54
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:38,810
Houston and armitage back in two

55
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,358
thousand six reported an alarming growth

56
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,540
in chair so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that study</font>

57
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:48,590
measured they had one vantage point that

58
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:52,358
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> telestra during 2005 and they</font>

59
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:56,150
log all messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what they observed</font>

60
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:58,940
that churn has double gin double wide

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:03,319
the routing table size grew by eighteen

62
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:07,099
percent so so basically they observed a

63
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:12,399
faster growth in turn than<font color="#E5E5E5"> interaction</font>

64
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:15,108
TF size which is alarming so our work

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,789
the bit different we try to measure the

66
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:21,079
evolution of chair over a longer period

67
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:22,340
at the core of the internet and we try

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,040
to understand

69
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,039
front components that could spew teacher

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:35,740
so this what we do we get our data from

71
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:41,419
relative use we study the period between

72
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:44,600
january 2003 until<font color="#E5E5E5"> august 2010 and we</font>

73
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,419
pick monitors in<font color="#E5E5E5"> four core networks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> api</font>

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">key level three sprint and france</font>

75
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:57,049
telecom so the data we get we we got the

76
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:59,690
data from<font color="#E5E5E5"> values oregon IX and here i</font>

77
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:04,850
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the IP addresses of the of the</font>

78
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:11,469
monitors that we used so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before i move</font>

79
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,470
to to to to the data and results um

80
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:18,050
let's just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through what determines</font>

81
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,810
turn so the first factor would be the

82
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">size of the network so other network</font>

83
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,979
grows then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more elements you</font>

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,190
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> more components you have more links</font>

85
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:32,240
you have more routers and potentially

86
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:35,630
more failures I changes so expect

87
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,340
channel to grow and I get the structure

88
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,900
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the properties of the</font>

89
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:44,719
topology so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example multihoming if</font>

90
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,719
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> ases start to increase multi-column</font>

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would amplify failures because</font>

92
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,690
fairies would be communicated through

93
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,190
different paths or through different ups

94
00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:00,919
teens and also we have the configuration

95
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,380
if you enable the timer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moai timer</font>

96
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,849
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down the number of</font>

97
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:10,700

00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:12,740
States and the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> mudflap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> damn you the</font>

99
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,750
other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of events</font>

100
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,160
that we have and how frequent they<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

101
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,630
for example a routing event that

102
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">affected transit link would have that</font>

103
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,380
carry multiple prefixes would have large

104
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:34,310
impact than a failure of a stop link or

105
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,190
likes link so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start so here I said</font>

106
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have</font>

107
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:42,390
just from 4a aces choruses<font color="#E5E5E5"> I usually i</font>

108
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,109
will like<font color="#CCCCCC"> present</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> results from mostly</font>

109
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:48,690
two monitors here just for like space

110
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:52,740
called space and so what I show here

111
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,750
this is what we get from Reggie's so we

112
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,500
showed that the daily number of updates

113
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:01,620
the total daily number of updates as we

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,260
saw from AT&T and through us through our

115
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:10,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pete as well we study field from 2003</font>

116
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:13,020
south at 10 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very noisy is</font>

117
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,520
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to say</font>

118
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:21,450
anything about this data like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

119
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,299
it grow how fast does it go at all it's

120
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,390
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult and and again you know</font>

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,670
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many large spikes there are</font>

122
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,710
level shifts<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you see to turn</font>

123
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:37,800
jumping to certain level then dropping

124
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:42,090
back and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe using statistical</font>

125
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,650
methods to analyze this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

126
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,650
right approach because if you statistics

127
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:51,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would smooth the time series try to</font>

128
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:53,429
move the outliers but those outliers

129
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,800
they tell us something about the network

130
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:01,140
so we need to understand them rather

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:04,860
than removing them so the best approach

132
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be to decompose these times is try</font>

133
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,210
to understand several several as the

134
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,289
different factors that kind of

135
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,630
contribute to this time since here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

136
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,490
show also the data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left I show</font>

137
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same but that they shouldn't last</font>

138
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,070
slide the right I show the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time</font>

139
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:29,130
series as we see it we saw it from level

140
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:32,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">three so you see here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the lot of 3</font>

141
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,830
is different we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower shifts we</font>

142
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,260
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> spies but they are not really</font>

143
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:39,599
correlated and this also tells us about

144
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,880
statistics here if we use statistics we

145
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,180
can get different results and different

146
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,640
conclusions so the approach that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

147
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,888
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow basically is to dissect this is</font>

148
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,129
too

149
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:54,309
v composite and try to understand the

150
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:57,069
several factors that contribute E also

151
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:58,660
you see on the difference in what we

152
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:02,319
observe here like there are difference

153
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,759
between 13 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight NT shows us there's</font>

154
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:10,269
something thats related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the monitors</font>

155
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:13,329
themselves so what we do is to take this

156
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:15,730
role time<font color="#E5E5E5"> series that we get from from</font>

157
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:17,799
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> rad views and then try to look at</font>

158
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:22,989
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> factors that are related to</font>

159
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:26,139
the monitor so just to mask or two to

160
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:27,879
take away those those effects of the

161
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,489
monitoring infrastructure or the

162
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,009
monitoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> s and we try to filter them</font>

163
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:34,809
out and look at what what is remaining

164
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:38,829
what what will occur tried the evolution

165
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:40,480
of churn in the internet so the first

166
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:44,498
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at is duplicate</font>

167
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:48,129
updates so by a duplicate I mean what I

168
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:51,459
mean like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't carry</font>

169
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:53,709
any new information so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you receive an</font>

170
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:57,329
update for a route that's just similar

171
00:09:53,709 --> 00:10:00,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the last update obviously this is not</font>

172
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:02,709
useful at all just more processing I

173
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:08,199
will discard it because doesn't carry

174
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:10,628
any new information so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

175
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:13,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">surprised we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that during the study</font>

176
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:18,040

177
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">where took duplicates here we show the</font>

179

183
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:40,540

186
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,769
observe that there are differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

187
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,939
is no trend here the are duplicates but

188
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:54,189
they are not increasing are not

189
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:56,370
decreasing they might increase they

190
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:59,498
might decrease but there is no trend and

191
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:04,149
across monitors also especially they are

192
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:09,370
different so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is what</font>

193
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">really causes this in the past the Lord</font>

194
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,120
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> were was suggested like a stateless</font>

195
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,519
implementations that don't keep track of

196
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,600
what was said what was sent the course

197
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,959
now we don't have stateless

198
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:29,279
implementations what we have is unwanted

199
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:32,888
interactions between<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPTV</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and ebgp and</font>

200
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,970
so what is some updates are quiet

201
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:39,730
informational within the ends but when

202
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,339
when they are set outside the body art

203
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,889
would strip some information that's not

204
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:49,509
to be conveyed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to look</font>

205
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:54,129
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a duplicate can we solve this yes</font>

206
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:56,829
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but we need to have</font>

207
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:59,800
with me to keep a state and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

208
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:04,209
match against a state so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to have</font>

209
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,069
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory and more processing so it's</font>

210
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:09,250
a question now who is going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

211
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:11,410
the center side or the receiver side now

212
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,170
it's all pushed to the receiver side so

213
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,969
we receive this duplicate you run your

214
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:20,860
decision process or whatever and then

215
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:22,689
you throw it away so to do that in terms

216
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,350
of exchange updates you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

217
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:25,349
to the sender side

218
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:32,100
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step we look at rerouting</font>

219
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,260
events our large local events these are

220
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:39,420
routing events that affect multiple

221
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:44,120
prefixes within the monitor is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or at</font>

222
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:47,310
the edge of the monitor is so unlike

223
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,610
duplicates large events are legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

224
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,680
mean they reflect some changes but they

225
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,000
are local<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> local to</font>

226
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,000
monitoring they don't tell us anything

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,100
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the overall evaluation of churn in</font>

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,330
the internet or at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core so so how we</font>

229
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:11,010
do this we define<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some heuristics</font>

230
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:12,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> group updates into events and then we</font>

231
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:21,330
define large<font color="#E5E5E5"> events as events that</font>

232
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:23,220
affect simultaneously 2003 fixes the

233
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,070
plots show the left we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

234
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,980
duplicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> three time series so we start</font>

235
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:33,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the row we filtered duplicates to</font>

236
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,640
the right we show which are the same

237
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:41,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> series after filtering large events</font>

238
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:43,439
so it's clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the most of the</font>

239
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,180
spikes<font color="#E5E5E5"> are gone now and we have less</font>

240
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,089
spikes in time series<font color="#E5E5E5"> so most of the</font>

241
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:50,430
spikes are caused by local effects that

242
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:54,740
I'm across the motor is or within the

243
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:59,489
monitor is when we looked into this

244
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:02,670
large events we found like failures

245
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:06,600
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s2 because of them or met</font>

246
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:10,380
oscillations or something sometimes we

247
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,630
saw communities that tells you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

248
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,000
we change the exit point<font color="#E5E5E5"> geographical</font>

249
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,700
communities so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefixes will just</font>

250
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,860
change will send you new updates for

251
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:25,050
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> previously just tells you we change</font>

252
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:29,790
the you exit point within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ends and</font>

253
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:32,880
we also observe that the frequency<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

254
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,390
the number of large events varies across

255
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,390
monitors

256
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,960
but I won't again to stress here I mean

257
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,560
we move large events not because they

258
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:47,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not relevant in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> satellite like they</font>

259
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,579
are wrong I mean like duplicates that

260
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:53,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">are super fullest not large events are</font>

261
00:14:51,580 --> 00:15:00,010
local and we want to get an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

262
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:02,890
the overall evolution of<font color="#CCCCCC"> chair if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

263
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:05,910
back look again at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but after</font>

264
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:10,930
removing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the large events we still see</font>

265
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:13,870
some peers were chair jumps like we have

266
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:19,209
level ships like the one in early summer

267
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:21,160
for we drop some<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drops by</font>

268
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:25,060
again sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> some five and then we</font>

269
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:28,120
see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> lovers ships in 2006 two of</font>

270
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:35,979
them so this what we'll be looking at

271
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:38,050
next so here I point out lava ships in 8

272
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,910
eng time series we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have five level</font>

273
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:45,520
shifts and the way we approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

274
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">languages was like we took all prefixes</font>

275
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,670
that I mean what updated doing the lover

276
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,979
shifts and we we try to see how much

277
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,270
chair is contributed how much choice

278
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be contributed by different</font>

279
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:02,730
prefixes so the right top plot shows the

280
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:06,819
contribution the contribution of

281
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:10,360
different fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> over or chair so during</font>

282
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">lover ships who observed that that only</font>

283
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,210
few prefixes just a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> fraction of</font>

284
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:21,310
prefixes contribute the majority of

285
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:23,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">churn so when we looked at this we far</font>

286
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:26,520
we found the courses to be continuous

287
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,470
flapping we find the causes to be

288
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,380
misconfigurations were making of

289
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:36,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet formation or leaking of private</font>

290
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:39,880
s numbers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

291
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:42,250
monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is so different monitors had</font>

292
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,439
different level shifts but usually the

293
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,010
forces were like flapping or some

294
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,460
misconfigurations

295
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:53,540
so when we move the lovers shifts we got

296
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:59,540
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time series on the bottom right</font>

297
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,540
that's relatively free of spice on jumps

298
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:07,470
so just to recap on this x is we started

299
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:09,300
from a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> row type series we filter</font>

300
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,380
duplicates which is clearly like

301
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,448
implementation mistakes or choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

302
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:20,670
then filtered large events that are

303
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:25,589
related to monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes and then we</font>

304
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:28,620
filter the lava sheets so we show that

305
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:32,040
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> to here we show that for the level</font>

306
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 monitor so I've been showing that for</font>

307
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,030
AT&T all the time now I show that to

308
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,490
love for level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we still see I mean</font>

309
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:42,600
we have leverage we have duplicates and

310
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:47,820
we have large events and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrive at</font>

311
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,679
about the same time series in the end so

312
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,530
we call this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a baseline chair the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cure</font>

313
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,920
not free of local effects of the

314
00:17:52,530 --> 00:18:00,660
molecule environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear of duplicates</font>

315
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:03,660
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crack try this it's more it's</font>

316
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,660
more first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> more tractable using</font>

317
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,810
statistical methods and when we could

318
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,480
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we thought we find that</font>

319
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:15,570
surprisingly this is growing relatively

320
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,790
slower than the router table size so the

321
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:22,919
chain has grown by 103 percent at most

322
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:26,810
while the routing table size grew by

323
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,610
like one hundred sixty-eight percent and

324
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:32,159
not most of the severe posture and

325
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,260
severe<font color="#E5E5E5"> spice or log lover ships are</font>

326
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,150
caused by local effects they are not

327
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,890
part they're not really caused by global

328
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,510
effects it's not because of the

329
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:45,690
evolution of the Internet per se and

330
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:48,990
and also found that now this formulators

331
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:51,030
to be more correlated so the correlation

332
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,070
like increased by order of magnitude

333
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,620
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> these time series</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now so the</font>

334
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:59,340
caption was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening in internet</font>

335
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:01,500
away from the local effects so the

336
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,620
growth in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this baseline churn is</font>

337
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,210
relatively slow I is unlikely to be a

338
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:11,340
threat in the near future the

339
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:15,330
scalability of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so just to</font>

340
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,820
summarize so as I said we started by

341
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,919
decomposing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time series here show</font>

342
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,159
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two pie charts show that the</font>

343
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,140
composition over the whole period so the

344
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,470
baseline term is like accounts for

345
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,750
thirty percent in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-four seven</font>

346
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:38,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent a lot of 3 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest is like</font>

347
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:42,000
local effects or duplicates so so to

348
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,230
conclude here we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

349
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,150
have some problems that we need to

350
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,940
address related to level shifts

351
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:51,330
misconfigurations related to large

352
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:55,850
events or one solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe what Lydia</font>

353
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:57,570
has presented about count but like

354
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,090
mitigating the effect of flapping

355
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,669
prefixes because we've seen flapping

356
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,909
prefix is causing lovely ships here and

357
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,340
causing large events so we can benefit a

358
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:11,670
lot from doing that by fixing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

359
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,290
have now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the baseline and we need to</font>

360
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,920
understand why the baseline is growing

361
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:20,670
slowly because whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

362
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,740
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to keep it because if we can't</font>

363
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,140
maintain these conditions that it might

364
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,670
grow faster and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will be a threat by</font>

365
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:33,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so our ongoing work now is to</font>

366
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:37,560
understand this quite understand the

367
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:42,300
reasons behind this slow growth we have

368
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:44,129
a theory<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm densification so networks</font>

369
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,950
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aether is getting</font>

370
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:52,330
denser both through peering or multi

371
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,490
so I the network good dancer failures

372
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,799
will have a limited scope because

373
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,820
there's there's always an alternative

374
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:03,279
route so if a link fails it's likely

375
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to affect few of you are at the</font>

376
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,149
network adesso we are looking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

377
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:11,110
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a conclusion a conclusive</font>

378
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:27,789
results yet and and here this is ending

379
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:29,469
my talk thank you very much I jeff has

380
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:32,169
ever a question about your methodology

381
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,210
for the duplicate stuff what source of

382
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:35,740
data but what is the form of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

383
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're using to determine that</font>

384
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,179
something is a duplicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we basically</font>

385
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:43,600
trace the time series that we get from

386
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:46,450
from Reggie's and we keep maintain the

387
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,719
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene update first of all with</font>

388
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,740
filter session resets from the data

389
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,210
between the collector and the monitor

390
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there are some such reasons</font>

391
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,100
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock up the module environment and</font>

392
00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:01,510
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep track of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update I'm we</font>

393
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">just compare the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this string my</font>

394
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,840
question is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little more fundamental</font>

395
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,549
than that the spin while since I've

396
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,799
looked at the ralphs use data are you

397
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,750
getting like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mrt files know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from there</font>

398
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah we go get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> marzipan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

399
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:17,010
you're actually doing for pgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that</font>

400
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:17,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">repairs yeah we do nothing right</font>

401
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:25,950
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris more google so I have a couple</font>

402
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">comments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one is that the view</font>

403
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,649
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edge of network is very different</font>

404
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,470
than the view in the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

405
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:33,570
and by the core I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 t-score level</font>

406
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 score in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular case so i</font>

407
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the update rates that you see at</font>

408
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the edge are somewhat suppressed and</font>

409
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,309
filtered it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different set so be it</font>

410
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,909
will be issued to see the same sort of

411
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:46,950
analysis apply to an internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> router in</font>

412
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,059
one of those networks right and you

413
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,010
probably would have to do it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

414
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,899
would suspect something like VIP as

415
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,850
opposed to just a straight BG because

416
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:56,699
you'll get a different view from that

417
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,969
too so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first observation the</font>

418
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,070
second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think filtering out</font>

419
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,960
the large event sort of hides some of

420
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,279
the problem here which is I can't

421
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,889
converge the network if I can't update

422
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,659
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough so I still need to</font>

423
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:11,309
understand what the maximum update rate

424
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,679
the particular device that can handle

425
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I exceed that that I have to</font>

426
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,620
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's gonna impress</font>

427
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,860
going to impact my convergence at that

428
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,979
time and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> impacts it over time long</font>

429
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,549
enough then I can't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> successful as a</font>

430
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,019
network operator right so I like the

431
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:29,580
fact that it you know there's some hey

432
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:30,659
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really not really a bigger</font>

433
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,460
problems we thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that</font>

434
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,200
was nice to see and seeing the data

435
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,659
filter down an appropriate fashion was

436
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,100
also nice but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internal data</font>
