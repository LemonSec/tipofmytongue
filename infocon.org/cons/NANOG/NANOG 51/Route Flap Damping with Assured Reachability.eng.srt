00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the amendment is your junk giving a talk</font>

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,539
because the students do the work and

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,820
professor give the talk but you accept

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:19,609
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we also have a great</font>

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">collaborator Francisco I really enjoyed</font>

7
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:24,170
the talk before me you know the he said

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,300
precisely the right word letís we

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,510
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operators to reduce the</font>

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,789
number 43 m cause this talk followed

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,850
exactly that spirit so what we're going

12
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:37,430
to do is about we want to do a flat

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,579
damping without the worry of losing the

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,100
disability<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all news</font>

15
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:46,540
everyone knows that I'm you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some</font>

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,820
time ago this ft was introduced and

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,160
because other docomo fillers and people

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,950
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce all these flaps you</font>

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,390
know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we measured the past I</font>

20
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,020
think that there is sometimes you get

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">even up to few hundreds of updates for</font>

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:08,450
our single prefix if you don't do

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:09,759
anything at all so notice the Opera

24
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,810
community we don't have to say a lot

25
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:18,080
here then<font color="#CCCCCC"> therefore the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RT implemented</font>

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,110
that I know if you flip a lot you get

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,150
hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back of the announcement so you</font>

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:28,189
don't damage the rest of the words<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rip off in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it stopped this all</font>

30
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,439
looks fine except that one people till

31
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:36,650
the measurement both by the academics in

32
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,589
new people observed in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality since</font>

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,210
didn't work that well so this one we

34
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,610
kicked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a previous talk on the</font>

35
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,070
topic there's a bunch of other talks as

36
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,560
well but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular one had some</font>

37
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,689
very rigorous analysis basically shows

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,710
that you know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing called</font>

39
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:57,470
am and has exploration when one filler

40
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:01,009
happens thanks or not thanks to the very

41
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,229
rich connectivity across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet I</font>

42
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,500
read out the tried so hard to find

43
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:09,348
alternative paths and takes up well to

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,878
get the things settled and now all of

45
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:14,399
these updates actually going to trigger

46
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,709
the dampening I remember

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,989
Rodney told me a story couple years ago

48
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,689
that he had a wine outer flip that just

49
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,540
once you know tongue an app and some we

50
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:27,090
are far end of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> this prefix</font>

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,909
got damn too far like half an hour and

52
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,040
he said this is not acceptable I agree

53
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:36,780
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that's probably going to</font>

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,780
trigger your l3 a.m. cause so research

55
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,340
you know community eagerly dive into the

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,129
problem to say hey we're gonna fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,609
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to reduce the false flat</font>

58
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,470
dampening bunch of schemes invented

59
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:51,900
trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to do a better</font>

60
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,569
job so we list the name there enough

61
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">both of them even with ours but the</font>

62
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:01,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is after all of it twice none of</font>

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:06,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">them is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that superly successful why</font>

64
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:10,980
because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do the</font>

65
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,769
executive I mean decision to say okay

66
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,988
now we see three updates or five updates

67
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,030
from a prefix and this must be flagging

68
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,889
so i can know just cut it off it's

69
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,129
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> dependent where you are and how</font>

70
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:26,280
the connectivity looks you may get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

71
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,730
updates but there isn't flat which is

72
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,459
some in the transient move or change

73
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,209
that caused the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past exploration and cut</font>

74
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,040
you to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your own decision and</font>

75
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,470
it's a wrap decision back then it's

76
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost five yrs recommended that less</font>

77
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:48,150
not to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dampening now and I seem</font>

78
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> final words so where we come</font>

79
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,870
here talk again because you know we do

80
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,299
measurement<font color="#CCCCCC"> or we know that the long</font>

81
00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:01,099
persistent where high frequency flipping

82
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:06,209
does exist you can talk numbers anywhere

83
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:07,918
so the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is that you know</font>

84
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,109
should we do anything about it or not

85
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,669
you know how bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be I just have</font>

86
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:17,310
one number here says that top 50

87
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:21,019
unstable prefixes generates almost like

88
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,090
ten percent of total updates

89
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:26,419
not only that you know you can tolerate

90
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:29,150
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> processing overhead because of</font>

91
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:31,580
those flaps but these days there's sting

92
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,909
real-time communications coming along

93
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> measurement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showed that I'm you</font>

96
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:46,008
real-time applications like we cut one

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,940
publication suggesting that about the

98
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:52,250
fifty percent of escape outages the

99
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:57,050
performance issues are coupled with the

100
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,490
PGP dynamics and also operators want to

101
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,280
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font>

102
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,909
applications you know feel better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,159
therefore this very aggressive reduction

104
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:09,080
in terms of Mr Al heimer you know either

105
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:11,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vitals get substantially reduced</font>

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,210
otherwise immolated turn off MRA I are

107
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,609
completely I think we have observe the

108
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,219
increased number of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pitchers turn</font>

109
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:30,289
off MRI as a consequence updates goes up

110
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:32,719
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy circle now how</font>

111
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:35,180
do you do better<font color="#E5E5E5"> then all the current</font>

state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of art we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can just</font>

look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the problem in a slightly</font>

114
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:44,419
different light you exam the previous

115
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:46,460
prob the solutions fundamentally people

116
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,810
struggle to<font color="#E5E5E5"> train to see how we can</font>

117
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,789
precisely identify the the flapping

118
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,699
prefixes but then we're going to stop

119
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:59,990
them and light princess<font color="#E5E5E5"> identification</font>

120
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:02,659
has been in the challenging so they'd

121
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,210
have identification with the suppression

122
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:08,599
they think the cutters are one then the

123
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:11,120
definite and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we figure that you know you</font>

inside I mean under identification<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

126
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:19,099
so can you somehow change our

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:23,569
suppression rules in to do no damage

128
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:27,050
just in case you make a mistake what do

129
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:29,770
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by that let's look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">picture you know what you may notice</font>

131
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,990
notice that is that in various

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,080
so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called covered prefixes that</font>

133
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,120
is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the love the shorter</font>

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,250
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists when people also</font>

135
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,000
announced long prefixes and not only

136
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:49,270
that the longer prefixes tend to be the

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,140
unstable ones compared compared to the

138

shorter ones besides is covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

140
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,080
in an alternative path to an unstable

141
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,570
prefix and very often you find out the

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,190
alternative<font color="#E5E5E5"> path is a stapler than your</font>

144
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:14,440
flapping back in the first so to give

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:17,650
you us you know illustration of our

146
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:22,510
ideas this was we think about in a

different sub prefix groups you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,850
there it's like a total prefix space

150
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:35,560
than the right circle is really the set

151
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:38,680
of unstable prefixes I said the picture

152
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't drawn to scale you know hopefully</font>

153
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,780
but didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that big</font>

154
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,120
percentage of the unstable prefixes it's

155
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,900
just the father illustration and then

156
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,610
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> yellow circle represent you know</font>

157
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,820
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pastor algorithm you can</font>

158
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,460
use to identify those unstable ones and

159
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,380
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are not really</font>

160
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">over lighting in with whatever the best</font>

161
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,820
thing you want to do there's always

162
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,060
unstable prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> or maybe you missed</font>

163
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,880
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is practice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the smaller percentage</font>

164
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,560
but you can see some overlapping area

165
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,290
between the red and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yellow there's a</font>

166
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,770
large percentage identify the pedal

167
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:20,770
yellow the false identification is not

168
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,620
really right and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the areas as</font>

169
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,010
potentially if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> temple and you</font>

170
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,650
really damaged the good prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

171
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:34,689
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> help in tempt and they lost your</font>

172
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,909
ability the blue circle<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing we</font>

173
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,880
identified we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that look guys there</font>

174
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,409
is so many prefixes out there you know

175
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,208
<font color="#CCCCCC">they either have alternative paths</font>

176
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:48,309
otherwise they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

177
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:51,128
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> stable covering prefix so what if</font>

178
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:55,629
you know given that we cannot do the

179
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:59,019
best identification<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unstable prefixes</font>

180
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:04,379
kawai just no damping those that is the

181
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:09,399
overlap between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yellow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the blue</font>

182
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:11,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay when we do that we can guarantee in</font>

183
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:16,449
case we catch the wrong that would be

184
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:21,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlap between the yellow and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

185
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:24,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">blue but outside the the red area we</font>

186
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really do much damage you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

187
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:31,179
disability is number one and we are sure

188
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:34,569
that that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought now the question</font>

189
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:37,119
is what's that percentage right as if a

190
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:39,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">cute dampening and you don't lose reach</font>

191
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:44,110
ability so we look at the two situations

192
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:48,220
why is the unstable pretty prefixes that

193
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:52,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">may have common prefix the other is that</font>

194
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">a prefix have alternative paths so this</font>

195
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really look at that all the prefixes</font>

196
00:09:54,009 --> 00:10:00,309
the life the figure shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for all</font>

197
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:03,369
the prefixes about half of them do not

198
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:06,549
have common prefixes and then others

199
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:10,089
like because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDF about over forty</font>

200
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:13,059
percent has one common prefix and the

201
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:15,220
moral have you know this another point

202
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:20,049
but the true that's how many they have

203
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the two common prefixes the grad figure</font>

204
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:27,670
tells that I because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have multiple</font>

205
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,819
providers that you have your customer

206
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,549
and then depending how many providers

207
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:35,979
you have essentially each of them can

208
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:38,319
give you a rich ability to a given

209
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,499
destination and how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the number</font>

210
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:44,949
i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this kind of no</font>

211
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:49,420
estimated we got this one not bgp data

212
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:50,630
collector at a london exchange and we

213
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,469
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

214
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:56,990
the the monitors the real router is

215
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,640
fading this factor assuming they are the

216
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,830
providers because it give us the full

217
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,980
table and we take the 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and</font>

218
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the current estimate we are</font>

219
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,050
later played with different games I

220
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,689
don't have it shown here but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

221
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:14,209
of the talk I have a pointer to a paper

222
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,490
we published that tells you that say

223
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have two providers you</font>

224
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:24,380
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more or less the same</font>

225
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:27,200
benefit now so now you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

226
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:31,010
know there's a great chance I'll in

227
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,960
stable prefix your<font color="#CCCCCC"> so called identified</font>

228
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,630
instable prefix which may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> true may be</font>

229
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,160
false there's a great chance there's

230
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,890
alternative ways to get to that

231
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,219
destination so what do we do now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

232
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:46,160
you know take the bathtub of this game

233
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has the highest accuracy yet</font>

234
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,360
terrifying unstable prefixes this is

235
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,120
somebody else a job we'll take whatever

236
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,360
solution other people evolved oh we're

237
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,020
have done is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add this douche ability</font>

238
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,850
check before you do the suppression what

239
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,949
you do is you get this prefix you see

240
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:08,000
that does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a alternative paths</font>

241
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:10,730
we cut protector pass if so you can not

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,100
definite but then you have to think

243
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the worst-case say that you know</font>

244
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:21,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a prefix longer 10 / 24 covered</font>

245
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:25,040
by another / 20 you'll say okay this is

246
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:28,189
/ 24 seem to be flapping let's stop

247
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,849
announcing it because there is a / 20

248
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:34,130
cover it but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know prepare for the</font>

249
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:39,200
worst case whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is / 20 is</font>

250
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:42,530
withdrawn so in that case then what will

251
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,750
decide to release this so considered in

252
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,000
stable prefixes because our goal is

253
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">reach ability first we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,890
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sacrifice disability</font>

255
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:55,630
because it can make generated you know

256
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,630
some small number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> moral updates</font>

257
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:03,110
then that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a basic idea very</font>

258
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:05,750
simple way we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do identification</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

259
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,730
instable prefixes we just say that when

260
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:11,839
you do the suppression before you do

261
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:15,980
that you know do a little check and for

262
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:19,610
those identified and instead of prefixes

263
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:22,610
if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a protector</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laos</font>

264
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:26,089
don't don't espresso that's what we do

265
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,920
and here's the evaluation again we don't

266
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have the road routers to try it</font>

267
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,390
out so we did was that you know using

268
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data collected by the PGP data</font>

269
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,949
collector and assuming the last few feet

270
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:40,100
we have so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> other providers to the</font>

271
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:42,470
customers and let's try it out so we get

272
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,060
the data the input to the collector we

273
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,209
run them through a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a simulated</font>

274
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,339
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> oft scheme because we don't know</font>

275
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:51,680
exactly which one is the best one which

276
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:56,930
is pick the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vanilla one like you know</font>

277
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:00,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">using the cisco parameters the we pick</font>

278
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:05,689
the one week of data december two

279
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:09,170
thousand nine and get the four piers to

280
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:12,680
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> four monitors and that's fit into</font>

281
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:17,719
this collector and simulating this kind

282
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:20,839
of provider customer relations in that

283
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,940
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we'll measure about</font>

284
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,209
disability law so he says is ok because

285
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,399
we just as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the loading table</font>

286
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:32,149
anywhere had the ability to a prefix

287
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:35,240
where you have it based on our scheme so

288
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:39,800
what we gain and what we lost is the

289
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">following that is the the download get</font>

290
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,319
reduced because you know we do thank

291
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,740
those in stable prefixes you know

292
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,160
identified we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> tempting those that</font>

293
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:56,450
has alternative paths and so the

294
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,360
stability also gets higher the adulterer

295
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:01,160
preference sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets sacrificed</font>

296
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,440
because you know the instable one's

297
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,610
going through provider one and the

298
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,730
stable ones

299
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,589
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> other two if you have preference</font>

your lights preferred provider that's

303
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:21,170
enough so to illustrate the specifics

304
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,810
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me show you here you know say that</font>

305
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,209
one customer has two providers and the

00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:39,529
the lower line on the left is the you

know announcement and withdrawals for

311
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:47,000
the preferred provider if you apply our

skin look at the grad figure what you

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:56,839
got is the the top one that decides that

314
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay as far as the young rich ability is</font>

315
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:04,100

00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:06,740
our fee as far as the shouting changes

317
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,070

I'm sorry the first one actually is no

321
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:24,410
dampening and the last line is our

322

result the middle line is the vanilla

323
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,910
RFD so see the bottom line has a few

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:57,260
bizarre what's the rapidity losses we

give some<font color="#CCCCCC"> rafa percentage they are like</font>

this is the updates reduction the

rightmost the line that represents a

344
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:49,620
note happening that's how many updates

345
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:51,960
you may get and then the our scheme give

346
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,689
you a result more or less you know close

353
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:23,330
we do substantially better than what you

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">know dampening so they are the again the</font>

355
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,389
right how to figure out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rightmost</font>

356
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,020
lon represent if you don't have the

357
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,250
dumpling that's how many are prefixes

358
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:36,240
how many dozen changes you're going to

359
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:39,840
have then if you do the dampening that's

360
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:45,090
a lifetime of mine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

361
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:47,490
less overlaps with the vanilla are 50

362
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,300
you know with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that little variation is</font>

363
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:53,220
slightly departed from that essentially

364
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,639
we're seeing that you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

365
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,280
have disability losses but you get

366
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,690
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same again in terms of the</font>

367
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,540
updates reduction and then also you gain

368
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,910
in terms of a lot irritability compare

369
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to no dampening so it's really kind</font>

370
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:15,270
of most of women situation the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> car</font>

371
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">supe like I mentioned earlier is about</font>

372
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:21,180
that preference if your life's preferred

373
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,179
provider has a stable pass you may you

374
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,980
know get onto that pass for some time

375
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,929
here it

376
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,210
your most preferred ones with the

377
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:32,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">controls is kind of flattering situation</font>

378
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:36,020
so this result is a pitch down these are

379
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,809
my sample points we got from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linden</font>

380
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,418
exchange points to verify whether it is

381
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">really representative results we look at</font>

382
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:47,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">a number for other data points so i</font>

383
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,730
think that here is the table showing the

384
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:54,350
data collected<font color="#CCCCCC"> from other characters you</font>

385
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,679
can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is number more or less</font>

386
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,928
clothes other some little variations but

387
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,820
the point I want to make it set for one

388
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:04,270
weekend to you the rich ability as well

389
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:09,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">as the cutting table gives you and</font>

390
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:12,918
second is that they are reduction it's

391
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:15,470
really odd it's a worse to him this is a

392
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,330
percentage of the total number of

393
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,700
updates you received you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

394
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:23,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">about would you like your larger get in</font>

395
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,130
a quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we know one-fifth nice that</font>

396
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,720
nothing updates I think that's a great

397
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:33,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">game and also in terms of the adult</font>

398
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:36,049
stability we also improved significantly

399
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:42,879
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time application</font>

400
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:47,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">netting I can like that so Q summarize</font>

401
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:50,840
it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple scheme to genki the</font>

402
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,049
reachability and yet we get almost very

403
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:59,418
close to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vanilla our fee reduction</font>

404
00:20:54,049 --> 00:21:01,639
in terms of the routing updates we offer

405
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:04,220
really a much better trade-off between

406
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,100
what you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on our 50 vs what</font>

407
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,559
you thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you turn off our 50 ok</font>

408
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,659
because turn on we mainly have the loss

409
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,940
of reach ability you turn now offer you

410
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,320
suffer from doubting instability and

411
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:21,140
also you know increase the daughter load

412
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:25,178
not only that you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said we</font>

413
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:27,559
don't really do the instability prefix

414
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:30,140
identification whatever the grid is the

415
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:32,720
scheme you have use it which is either

416
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,630
be so checking when you decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

417
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,900
suppression

418
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,300
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it very clear about</font>

419
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,760
that we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just developing yet</font>

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">another brand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new and after this game</font>

421
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,500
this was very often<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first question</font>

422
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,840
people say oh it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just another RT and i</font>

423
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,120
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we just do a</font>

424
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,330
patch for whatever your favorite of the

425
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,330
if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to make it guarantee</font>

426
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:04,090
usability of the prefixes in them learn

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be unstable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then this</font>

428
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,620
you know academically speaking of course

429
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,930
we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the gains the</font>

little lost in terms of preference but

431
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:16,620
there's a bigger concern that is how

432
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy this would be to really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implement</font>

433
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,570
that is a question for out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

434
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,730
dancing so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more details are put on</font>

some conference that get you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

439
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,820
hi Alicia Chavez know so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

440
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,440
implementable I think no having these

441
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,460
numbers is a really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you've</font>

442
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">been wanting the sort of thing for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

443
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,720
while as the one question I have that

444
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,820
might be in your numbers but not talked

445
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,610
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your slides is for these more</font>

446
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,010
specific covered prefixes have you done

447
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,620
the Fate sharing analysis to see are

448
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:06,180
these no more specifics actually within

449
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:08,610
the same network as the less specific no

450
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,080
I haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one so one of the</font>

451
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,240
things that suggest as they follow on to

452
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,540
this paper know which is really

453
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,160
important it's often the case that these

454
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,020
more specifics are you know being leaked

455
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,730
out for traffic engineering purposes or

456
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,280
other things we had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> defined those</font>

457
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,350
kisses yeah but it's also the case that

458
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,149
occasionally customers will wander away

459
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,669
with a portion of your address space and

460
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,390
live elsewhere on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

461
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately suppressing that more</font>

462
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:34,560
specific in the case where the less

463
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,410
specific network isn't providing transit

464
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,909
to it anymore can cause them problems so

465
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,160
it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to see that explored</font>

466
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:44,190
further in your work thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well</font>

467
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,510
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did catch the places where i</font>

468
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,460
know you mention about traffic

469
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:51,420
engineering it's a very clear they just

470
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,760
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but we need to do a more</font>

471
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:59,100
quantitative measurement to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer your</font>

472
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">question yeah can you put a cisco just</font>

473
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,159
just a quick note to follow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

474
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:07,230
Jeff's comments if you end up

475
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,030
suppressing more specifics in that case

476
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,550
it you won't be any worse than the

477
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,930
existing route flop dampening cases that

478
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,930
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have today so</font>

479
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:26,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">no more questions thank you</font>
