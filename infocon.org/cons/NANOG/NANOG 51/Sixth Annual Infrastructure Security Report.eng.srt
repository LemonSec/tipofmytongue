some type of some type of disruption to

of the report in how often folks are

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,399
actually decreased over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years but</font>

451
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:25,629
still is a measurable measurable

452
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:27,039
response but half the got half<font color="#CCCCCC"> the group</font>

453
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,080
have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> confidence that law</font>

454
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,179
enforcement has the capabilities to deal

455
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,549
with the event but two-thirds believe

456
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,080
that there's really no net improvement

457
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:36,700
or there's a reduction in law

458
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,780
enforcement capabilities to deal with

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,830

I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering drive there any lake</font>

487
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,550
with v6 any new attack vectors or old

<font color="#CCCCCC">of implementation issues with v6 or</font>

anything like that now thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font>

491
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,420
question we didn't see a real parsing

492
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,670
out of attack events within the v6

493
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">network most of the responses were</font>

494
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,380
focused around the instrumentation

495
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,750
effort in the v6 network then itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

496
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,180
then a prediction of what potential

497
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,280
threats they may experience so primarily

498
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,730
the the potential concerns were things

499
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,649
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> flaws of the stack of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notation and</font>

500
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:43,940

505
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,540
was a reflection<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack against DNS</font>

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:04,700
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and the DNS SEC is it is anybody</font>

509
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,730
worried that it caused a bigger problem

510
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,500
because it makes your nameservers more

511
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,480
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take down because I have to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">calculate adores every calculating their</font>

513
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,710
answers or how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work I don't</font>

514
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we parse that level of data i</font>

515
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,540
think that the certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the primary</font>

516
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,820
concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> was around the load of the</font>

517
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,620
resolver layer that the resolver layer

518
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,929
now has to effectively resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

519
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,929
aspects both the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chain of authority</font>

520
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:32,120
as well as the result<font color="#E5E5E5"> dancer as well</font>

521
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:34,430
outside of that i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if we have</font>

522
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough data to parse out an answer for</font>

523
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,510
you thank you

524
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:49,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yeah right you had its like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers</font>

525
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:52,380
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> usage of pcps over into space do you</font>

526
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:55,500
think do you expect these numbers to be

527
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">roughly the same for the non respondents</font>

528
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,570
to the survey or do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font>

529
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">vast differences between those operators</font>

530
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:08,310
who were on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the polar region and those</font>

who<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good question so i</font>

532
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:13,139
guess i'm speculating now whether we're

533
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,399
capturing a reasonable reasonable

534
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,990
representation of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community's</font>

535
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,350
activities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font>

536
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only from the fact that we're</font>

537
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,250
gathering data from across geographic

538
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,770
distributed organizations and

539
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:29,510
organizations that do cover large

540
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:32,129
swathes of the global geography however

541
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,260
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> this trends may be different</font>

542
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,020
in other vertical markets or other

543
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,879
focused particular aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

544
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,310
markets that we may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be touching as</font>

545
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,100
much we have focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some service</font>

00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,810
provider type markets you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

547
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,459
past we've seen kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> growing group</font>

548
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,139
of others which this year we tried to

549
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,830
break out and figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is the</font>

550
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,620
other and the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups were DNS</font>

551
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,050
operators as well as mobile operators so

552
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,530
we did get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some information further</font>

553
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:03,510
parse doubt about who's responding but

554
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually you know in order to speculate</font>

555
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,440
on I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly sure if we're really</font>

556
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,949
missing a large swath you do you have a

557
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,279
feeling that these are really skewed

558
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:18,330
from from typical operations yes

559
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:22,320
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some an operator who responds to</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the survey has sega links to some</font>

degree some interest in security<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

563
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,899
there might be a large chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

564
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:38,158
operators civil maybe not say the US or

00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:40,039
residue of another person towards we

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,169
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take care of stuff like this and</font>

don't participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey so I my</font>

568
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:50,479
expectation is it might be different

569
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:50,479
there mmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay thanks for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback</font>

570
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:55,820
there are questions

<font color="#E5E5E5">I was I was just gonna serve ask a</font>

572
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,340
follow on on that and if you had any

573
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,830
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of why you had such a low of</font>

00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,730
sponsor<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight from i think it was Africa</font>

575
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,169
but the emerging countries in general

576
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,270
could be it could be related to what you

577
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:18,660
were just saying that if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

578
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,710
mitigation infrastructure in place you

579
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,830
probably don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be advertising</font>

580
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:27,150
there but I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure yeah certainly</font>

581
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:29,760
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a reluctance or there is an</font>

582
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,650
observed reluctance from folks who have

583
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,890
been victimized attacks to report and

584
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,780
provide further feedback about attacks

585
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,040
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly seems to be some</font>

586
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,649
frustration where the attack is

587
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,360
effective that that reporting will bring

588
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,760
more scrutiny on the policies and

589
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:50,729
activities of the group rather than

590
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:56,310
support and and further education thanks
