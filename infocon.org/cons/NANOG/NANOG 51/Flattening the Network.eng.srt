I

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:14,700
I arrived yesterday lunchtime and at

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,750
that time I still thought that I was

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,349
very smart and then I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me with</font>

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of you folk and I</font>

6
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:29,100
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> transported back 20 or so years to</font>

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,110
my time at University you know I

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,809
recognize some of the t-shirts in some

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,239
of the the haircuts and some of the

10
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,890
really infused conversations technical

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,440
conversations with that were going on

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,100
you know even even the accents were

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,739
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if dave and rob are</font>

here or aj with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> british accents is</font>

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,349
there anyone here from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Great Britain ya</font>

16
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:54,388
wanna thank you one or two so I felt

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,289
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much at home but what was different</font>

18
00:00:54,389 --> 00:01:02,039
between the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-odd years ago and</font>

19
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,309
yesterday was that I am now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy in</font>

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the class that can't quite keep up now</font>

21
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,210
you might think that I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so</font>

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,520
enthused about being here<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font>

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,369
that but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I'm even</font>

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,800
more excited because it shows to me it

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,240
reaffirms to me that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the</font>

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,840
mix of audience that I should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,560
to now at exactly the right time in

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,690
exactly the right location now i'm going

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,340

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a logarithmic one you'll have</font>

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,950
whether you view the great increase in

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,560
bandwidth demand that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,820
and continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see as being logarithmic</font>

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,560
or exponential or or some kind of

of growth a bandwidth demand is growing

64
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,700
yeah the growth is growing the growth

65
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,690
rate therefore we're talking about

66
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:16,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">acceleration and which case we need a</font>

67
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:19,230
great more bandwidth supply over our

68
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,930
networks so where's this demand coming

69
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,850
from would anyone like to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one or</font>

70

two answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say that this great</font>

71
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,660
demand coming from

72
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,800
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd adventure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say thank you I</font>

73
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,940
venture to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that not only are the</font>

74
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:43,420
early users of the internet now using

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,820
far far more bandwidth than before but

76
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,070
we're even<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing Uncle Bill and Aunty</font>

and granny who would never have thought

90
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">over the web on youtube at the original</font>

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,590
fantastical so if all of the middle

93
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,330
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> and upper class people and the</font>

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,310
Americas if all the people who can

afford it<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to jump on the web at</font>

96
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,000
the same time will you you're all know

97
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,250
better than me they might have bandwidth

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,350
at we're going to be being asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:53,520
provide over just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few years it</font>

100
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:57,280
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be absolutely gigantic and</font>

101
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,840
actually reminds me as well that I'm

102
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">just watching my own television series</font>

of 24 people familiar with a show called

104

24 key for Sullivan please Jack Bauer

105
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's run for a fantastical eight seasons</font>

106
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:14,680
I am invested advertising<font color="#CCCCCC"> in competition</font>

between the the satellite channels and

the cable channels eight seasons is just

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,280
incredible you know and I think I've got

110
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">our friends at Cisco to thank for that</font>

111
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they were funding it and I've</font>

112
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">got we request for those of you from</font>

113
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,840
Cisco if you can pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

114
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,820
more money<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand that the feature</font>

115
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,280
film is held up by<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks at the moment</font>

116
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,690
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can't afford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fund it but</font>

117
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,469
the point I'm trying to make here is I

118
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,240
watched almost all of the season<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

119
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:45,710
of 24

on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox website in high definition so</font>

121
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,400
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've leave at this point enough</font>

122
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,460
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about a fantastic amount</font>

123
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,198
of bandwidth that's needed and then last

124
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,560
is somebody in the audience please<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font>

125
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:01,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">me if there is who's going to have a pet</font>

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,219
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> another way of getting more</font>

129
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,219
bandwidth out of our networks

130
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:24,999
what I like to do is just take a moment

131
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:28,599
to look a slight of a summary of just my

132
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:30,189
view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know now we</font>

133
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,289
have a situation where we get a very

134
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:35,139
high volumes or video and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

135
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:38,680
traffic that's negatively impacting our

136
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:41,020
profitability we've get growing measures

137
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,469
measures of core routers to handle this

138
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,969
ever-increasing traffic and most

139
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:48,069
importantly for what I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

140
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:50,520
just now we get separate IP and

141
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:54,610
transport domains with very very little

142
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,770
cross domain visibility and what I'm

143
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,009
suggesting to do is that we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

144
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:04,330
situation where we have a new

145
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:06,909
architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> that leverages all of the</font>

146
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,370
technologies that we have to snow that

147
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:13,419
is integration of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> optical domain</font>

148
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:18,389
into the IP domain with some form of

149
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,389
cross layer visibility and automation

150
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:26,439
and what I'm saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we need to</font>

151
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:30,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">get smart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to look at the bigger</font>

152
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:33,610
picture by me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the the vendors and</font>

153
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:37,120
if we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be helped is people</font>

154
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:40,899
like all of you upon whom I'm relying to

155
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,550
design our new networks I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

156
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:46,689
quotation from last week's state of the

157
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:50,709
union address we need to out-innovate

158
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:53,499
out-educate and out-build the rest of

159
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:57,009
the world innovation doesn't just change

160
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:59,019
our lives it's how we make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in</font>

161
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:02,349
other words the president of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the u.s. it</font>

162
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:05,439
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> an implied warning there if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

163
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,219
innovate our network designs someone

164
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,219
else will

165
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,760
so here's all of you up on the top floor

166
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,880
and third or fourth floor according to

167
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,400
this diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> here running networks</font>

designing the network's designing IP

169
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,919
networks which are robust indeed I

170
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,710
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to build an IP</font>

171

early or too<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that is that correct</font>

174
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:41,789
just to be safe why is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

175
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:45,029
to do that well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we cannot</font>

176
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:48,029
easily see or even control what's

177
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:51,600
happening downstairs and this is a good

178
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:55,170
cue for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entrance of OT n optical</font>

179
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,690
transport networks and I know this was

180
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:01,050
introduced this morning by Greg our

181
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,610
Hawkins and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brent and Dawson when they</font>

182
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,060
were talking giving their excellent

183
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,850
presentation about 100g many of you have

184
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,910
already heard about<font color="#CCCCCC"> otn some of you mean</font>

185
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,700
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> here before what's important for me</font>

186
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:18,480
to tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> otn has come of</font>

187
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:21,120
age we now<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the introduction at the</font>

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">end of last year of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standard for ODU</font>

189
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:30,330
flex so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technology which</font>

190
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:33,959
is just begging to be utilized<font color="#CCCCCC"> for IP</font>

191
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,700
networks just very<font color="#CCCCCC"> briefly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for those who</font>

192
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,589
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not heritable TN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to great</font>

193
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,140
advantages firstly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sailfin kind</font>

194
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:43,110
itself time and the second thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

195
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's got variable with pipes of your</font>

196
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,800
like you can choose the bandwidth that

197
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,779
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> for each and every application</font>

198
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,050
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all we now have the</font>

199
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:57,779
ability to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans or other IP</font>

200
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,560
traffic and groom it at several levels

201
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:05,880
port level support lambda lambda level

202
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,520
and to encapsulate this traffic in pipes

203
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,370
that have bandwidth of our own choosing

204
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,310
by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can have transport</font>

205
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,350
pipes that can be any<font color="#E5E5E5"> size at all</font>

206
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,589
between 1.25 gig

207
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:24,130
and a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> gate or even 400 gig yeah</font>

208
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:27,340
we can start it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 1.25 gig and</font>

209
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:31,060
we can increase in increments of 1.25

210
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:35,230
gigabits per second in increments that

211
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:40,030
you choose and that's massive I believe

212
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:43,360
in my opinion now I'm saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

213
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:46,000
can do it not there more or us is

214
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,280
because I am talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about changing the</font>

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,420
network you changing that the network

216
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:58,569
from this and that is not correct from

217
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:05,160
this which where we have an independent

218
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:08,950
IP and optical domain to this a single

219
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">unified control plane for you our</font>

220
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:15,700
network designers have control not only

221
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:20,500
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routers and the switches but</font>

222
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:22,450
over all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the assets in the network so</font>

223
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,760
what I'm talking about is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

224
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,920
uses all of our technologies to optimize

225
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,930
the entire network rather than just

226
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,280
local areas bottlenecks local

227
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:37,150
requirements and my friends this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

228
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,490
a zero-sum game where you have to choose

229
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,880
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> one technology or another and</font>

230
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,530
let me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> exemplify I want to mention</font>

231
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,230
my daughter<font color="#E5E5E5"> because she's watching just</font>

232
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,819
now two three nights ago my daughter

233
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,000
who's two years old<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i were watching</font>

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">bambi does anyone remember bambi yeah</font>

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,190
good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I see some tears of</font>

236
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,340
hearing in people's eyes at the

237
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,440
beginning of Bambi hi the camera appears

238
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,630
to move through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the through the forest</font>

239
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,000
before we've actually met the baby deer

240
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:10,870
and we see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small animals and</font>

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,490
there is a point where mama bird lands

242
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,490
in the nest and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three little baby</font>

243
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,710
birds and she drops in a twig<font color="#CCCCCC"> with five</font>

244
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,530
berries on it and in immediately two of

245
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,210
the parts grab the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends of the twig yeah</font>

246
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,339
and they pull back and forth between

247
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,560
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero-sum</font>

248
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,630
game one of them is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to win and the</font>

249
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,910
other one's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose but while they</font>

250
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,920
are busy struggling away

251
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,949
the third little<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby bird comes up and</font>

252
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">eats all five varies leaving the other</font>

253
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,840
two looking rather stupid so one thing

254
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,660
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not a situation where you</font>

255
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,820
have to choose between<font color="#CCCCCC"> one kind of</font>

256
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,910
network or another kind one kind of

257
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,910
protocol or another what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is</font>

258
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:53,790
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> not use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them all and why not control</font>

259
00:12:50,910 --> 00:13:01,410
them all yourselves in one single

260
00:12:53,790 --> 00:13:03,540
cross-domain control plane now I know

261
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">historically you've all relied upon the</font>

262
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:12,209
OSI<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> per protocol stack since 1984</font>

263
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,400
before I had a breakfast discussion with

264
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:18,780
several people this morning at the

265
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:21,569
newbies conference and we talked just

266
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,339
for a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes about how the protocol</font>

267
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,680
stack is used these days and it's still

268
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,890
extremely relevant in their opinion in

269
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,479
that it gives a means that people from

270
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,670
different companies from different

271
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,890
expertise can continue to understand

272
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,380
what each other's talking about but the

273
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,030
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that some other</font>

274
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:45,030
things are starting to slip in

275
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:48,150
expressions like layer 2.5 yeah or layer

276
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:51,360
0 yeah i mean what's all that what's all

277
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:54,449
that how there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no such</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in the 84</font>

278
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">or even the 94 protocol stack but the</font>

279
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,920
point they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a to me</font>

280
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,600
is this that the world has changed a

281
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,510
little bit over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last quarter century</font>

282
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,650
and it's not quite so easy to put things

283
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:10,620
into the perspective of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original</font>

284
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:13,199
stack if you like so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an opening</font>

285
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,030
in their opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know to form</font>

286
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,790
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> round about where three layer</font>

287
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:20,370
to layer 2.5 I don't care layer 2.1

288
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,660
where we can make what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm showing on</font>

289
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,940
the screens just<font color="#E5E5E5"> now actually work</font>

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say it's some going to</font>

291
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,350
be rather difficult transition for

292
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:33,569
people back in the company where I work

293
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,570
I mean let's face it human beings are

294
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,110
usually happiest in an environment where

295
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,250
we understand everything that's

296
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:45,310
on however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe that most of you</font>

297
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:48,610
who wish to who gravitate towards this

298
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:51,609
solution will be the ones who design the

299
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:56,290
new protocols that will assure the jobs

300
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:57,579
of me you and many many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

301
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,490
quite a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years going forward</font>

302
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:02,709
because just to paraphrase the State of

00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:08,410
the Union speech if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

304
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:11,260
somebody else will now here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

305
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:17,310
picked out some of the actually let's

306
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:19,829
have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this firm on this is some</font>

307
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:26,109
this is just an example of three nodes

308
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:28,779
and you see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a God box this</font>

309
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,930
is three separate shelves if you like at

310
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:34,930
a particular node quite discreet and at

311
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,899
the top at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top we've got the very</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligent rotor right the router</font>

313
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:42,610
with a big power of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big CPU that</font>

314
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">does the real thinking beneath it we've</font>

315
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,300
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's the bandwidth</font>

316
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,949
manager that's what analysts call cross

317
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,290
connects these days so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just call</font>

318
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:52,439
it cross connect and beneath that yeah

319
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:57,189
we've got the not very bright at all

320
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,470
optical box or raw done or DWDM box and

321
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,750
if as in this example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font>

322
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,970
particular stream needs the processing

323
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,660
power by golly it goes through the very

324
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligent very useful router in this</font>

325
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:13,300
example here we go the same three nodes

326
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,599
with something which is already been

327
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,930
predetermined by this control layer not

328
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,440
to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that level of processing and if</font>

329
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:25,449
we go to hear we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> even find that</font>

330
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,279
sometimes at some loads we don't even

331
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:29,079
need one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boxes for example the</font>

332
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,110
cross-connect is missing from node<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

333
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,969
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talking about having modular</font>

334
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,560
systems I'm not talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> god box</font>

335
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,350
i'm not talking about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font>

336
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,130
do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm talking about just</font>

337
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,779
smartly picking out only the

338
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:47,860
functionality that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font>

339

each node in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> various networks now as</font>

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,189

341
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,509
will be uncomfortable so I just thought

342
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:55,240
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your permission I'd like to take</font>

343
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:58,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a few moments to talk about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

344

the potential<font color="#CCCCCC"> hartles to be overcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

346
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,270
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> network flattening should be done</font>

347
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:09,250
at the DWDM layer not at the ODU layer

348
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,199
to reduce the complexity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font>

349
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,650
of optical cross connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I would</font>

350
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:19,659
argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are situations where IP</font>

351
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:22,539
/ WDM makes sense especially when we're

352
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:24,010
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> having oak floors there</font>

353
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:27,609
are trade-offs and one of the trade-offs

354
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,379
is that the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider would need to</font>

355
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:32,168
whoever ran the net what we need to

356
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,440
integrate both<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP and optics</font>

357
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:38,140
operations groups and at the moment most

358
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,990
providers who need a clear demarcation

359
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,970
between IP and optical domains prefer

360
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:47,940
black and white interfaces from the

361
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:52,840
router that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> colored a CW DMR WDM</font>

362
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:55,510
IP / w DM is typically limited to metro

363
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,340
and regional networks since as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

364
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,669
know router wavelengths which are put

365
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:04,449
into DWDM must conform usually to very

366
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:06,760
rigorous engineering rules belief number

367
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,659
two you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect both IP</font>

368
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,530
and optical layers<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah an emphasis</font>

369
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:16,659
should be put on IP layer protection

370
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,850
well I kind of think probably that this

371
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:21,429
claim assumes that optical protection

372
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,370
would be slow since it's down at the

373
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:26,770
lambda layers well if this is so it's a

374
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,989
fallacy again because the fact is in my

375
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,850
opinion as you move down the protocol

376
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:36,970
stack things actually happen faster

377
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:40,030
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would argue also that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

378
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,950
protections are better than one so

379
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,290
something I'm particularly hoping we can

380
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,680
discuss in June

381
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:50,170
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some more beliefs up here you</font>

382
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see I'm thinking I'm thinking to</font>

383
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,180
myself sooo<font color="#E5E5E5"> joyner that I'll give you</font>

384
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:58,330
all my requests to put up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web</font>

385
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:00,280
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> 442 read along with my slide set</font>

386
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:07,240
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would be a good</font>

387
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:10,270
time to come to my conclusion hmm my

388
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,160
main objective is to get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

389
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,350
interested not all of you but some of

390
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,690
you interested in flattening flattening

391
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,600
the network and I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font>

392
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,340
people who think mmm this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting</font>

393
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,129
let's think about it for the next few

394
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,290
months will then sign up to come to our

395
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,530
birds of a feather session which will be

396
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,970
in june though<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to be around</font>

okay quick quick show of hands who at

415
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:26,020
the moment is considering coming to the

416
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,710
good old argument with me in June in

417
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,929
Denver I see good thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>
