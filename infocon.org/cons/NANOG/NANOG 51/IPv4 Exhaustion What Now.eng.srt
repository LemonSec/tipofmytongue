00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,259
network solutions at the time and

29
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,540
decided that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in the ripe</font>

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,220
region and in the AP neck region there

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,910
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a regional internet registry</font>

32

that's member<font color="#E5E5E5"> LED and does community</font>

33
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:36,030
based policies so we formed erin erin

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,190
was actually the registry of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

registry of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the world</font>

36
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,929

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,500
that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be regional registries</font>

41
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,259
that serve the needs of each community

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,330
and we found communities in Latin

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,250
America that one at the foreman re are

44
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,690
we help support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

has been fully depleted and folks are

around to talk about that how<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron will</font>

53
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,970
handle requests that are coming in this

is relevant<font color="#CCCCCC"> because some of you work for</font>

companies who put requests into Aaron to

56
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,079
get address space and you know how it's

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,099
worked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 20 years and now you need</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how it's going to work going</font>

59
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:39,459
forward because it's a little different

60
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start right in post</font>

p.m. is the network resource policy

64
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,860
manual it's a set of policies adopted by

65
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,519
the community on how we do address

66
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:57,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">allocation and assignments so there's a</font>

67
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,200
policy that says once you once you're

68
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,119
known Darren you've been a member for

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,589
more than a year you can request up to

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,890
12<font color="#E5E5E5"> months worth of addresses and that's</font>

71
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,920
what most of you do once the final /

72
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate has been received by Aaron we only</font>

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,220
allow processing of requests that are up

to 90 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> three month supply so it's</font>

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,060
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't get addresses it's</font>

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,579
just you need to come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them</font>

77
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,190
in smaller cups your bucket is smaller

78
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,959
we'll see you more often in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way we</font>

79
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,609
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the circumstance for parties get a</font>

80
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,019
year's worth and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else gets</font>

81

none everyone gets three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

ever comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back gets three months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,829
then everyone comes back and gets three

84
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,260
months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll see what happens</font>

85
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,760
after that that next three months so

86
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,048
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the first thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

87
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,260
realize you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be putting in more</font>

88
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:44,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">requests because it creates an even run</font>

89
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,959
out provision doesn't apply to transfers

90
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">under specified transfers I'll talk a</font>

91
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,200
little bit about that so the other

92
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:57,730
policy specified transfer policy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">PM 8.3 proved and implemented provides</font>

94
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,540

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">to free up IP address box like by</font>

96
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,319
renumber getting themselves in the lower

97
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,450
half of the block and freeing the higher

98
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,060
one for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> can transfer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to another</font>

99
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,488
party that meets the requirements for

100
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,980
address space so if you qualify for

101
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,599
address space and you need address space

102
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you come to Aaron and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want your</font>

103
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:21,849
assignment and we say you qualify but we

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,130
have none you can in turn bring another

105
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:24,570
party whose grab them by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> year drag</font>

106
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,280
them over

107
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say they're going to give me</font>

108
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,989
addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll update the records</font>

109
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,630
accordingly now it's quite possible that

110
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,640
you're going to incendium how for that I

111
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,370
don't know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to know actually</font>

112
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,260
I have no interested in knowing so it's

113
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,180
possible that they'll be renewing going

114
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,010
around there that's perfectly fine all

115
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,050
we need to know is we're transferring

116
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,190
addresses this also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means you can only</font>

117
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,710
get address space that you can actually

118
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,750
qualify for and it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a year's</font>

119
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,299
worth of address space based on your run

120
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,310
rate of demand so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way if</font>

121
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,520
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of position</font>

122
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,610
for ipv6 that new<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Protocol and</font>

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need a little more time this is also</font>

124
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,350
a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address it even when Aaron</font>

125
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,170
doesn't have resources um this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

126
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">only transfer policy that's recognized</font>

127
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,750
so there's a merger transfer policy i'll

128
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,980
talk about that is this transfer policy

129
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,140
but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other ways to move</font>

130
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:23,160
addresses around that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron recognizes</font>

131
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,380
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start about the M&A the policy</font>

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,350
that was adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network resource</font>

133
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,570
policy banning recently says unused

134
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,080
address space must be returned to air

135
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dirty and M&A a transfer so if you</font>

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,490
acquire an organization and it has a

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,740
substantial amount of address space and

138
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,990
it has a less substantial network

139
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,820
infrastructure the address space that

140
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,250
gets transferred is what's needed for

141
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,159
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network infrastructure it is not the</font>

142
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,660
entire block surprise surprise you want

143
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,100
the rest of the block specify transfer

144
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,610
policy we already talked about that have

145
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,710
a nice day um so sorry all good news

146
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,870
this morning to policies that might

147
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,580
affect this that the community is

148
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,560
currently discussing and it will be

149
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,440
discussed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our sin currently under</font>

also under discussion at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the upcoming</font>

coordinated transfer policy PP 1 19

155

policy proposal 119 which will allow

156
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,719
transfers of IP addresses the resource

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,860
so too

161
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,950
extent that another<font color="#CCCCCC"> rir has a matching</font>

policy or complementary policy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not between two parties in the iron</font>

region but to another region that should

166
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,390
be possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still under</font>

167
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,100
discussion it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not pass it may pass</font>

168
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,710
the extent that you think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

169
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,150
important you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably rather</font>

170
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,560
than waiting to see what happens you

171
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,419
should probably voice support or

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,190
opposition to it and you can do that

173
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">online you do not need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an errand</font>

174
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,060
member you do not need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to a</font>

175
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,470
meeting just<font color="#CCCCCC"> get on the mailing list and</font>

176
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,480
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these proposals</font>

177
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,690
another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is protecting number</font>

178
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,850
resources which right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron when we</font>

179
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,670
see something that looks like fraud we

180
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,410
we actually do act against that and we

181
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,110
do occasionally reclaim address blocks

182
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,750
that people transfer contrary to try to

183
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,210
fans for contrary to policy this one

184
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,850
says to<font color="#E5E5E5"> proactively look for fraud</font>

185
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,870
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little different that means</font>

186
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,150
actively looking out there for people

187
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,730
doing transfers that's looking at

188
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,770
routing tables and corporation

189
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,080
bankruptcies and I can think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

190
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,150
bunch of other ways of doing it um<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

191
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,810
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost time</font>

192
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's membership money I you know will</font>

193
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,380
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or not again that's your</font>

194
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,150
input if you want Aaron to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

195
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,500
do that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want us do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it we</font>

196
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't do it but you need to put your</font>

197
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,330
input on the mailing lists or come to

198
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the San Juan meeting or even better both</font>

199
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:57,990
so that's kind of where we are looking

200
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,940
at what happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 requests</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

201
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,190
depletion the policies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

202
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,440
highlighted are the soft landing

203
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,500
provisions which our policy will kick in

204
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,260
very soon the specified transfer policy

205
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,330
which is in effect as well and then

206
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,070
these policy proposals will have impact

207
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,599
on how address requests are handled if

208
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:21,090
they're adopted they<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't been</font>

209
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">adopted at just in discussion um so the</font>

210
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,060
way errands incorporated we have some

211
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,450
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our articles of corporation</font>

212
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">charter and mission that caused us to</font>

213
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,020
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to stewardship</font>

214
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,200
conservation aggregation and

215
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,939
registration of number of resources we

216
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,329
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're not a</font>

217
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,149
passive entity

218
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:43,659
and protecting these values so it's the

219
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:46,769
extent that someone is using resources

220
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,879
contrary to policy we reclaim resources

221
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,259
nowadays that's wonderful because we

222
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,269
reclaim resources and it seems that

223
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:54,339
there's a great pool of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who want</font>

224
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,480
more numbers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll very quickly be</font>

225
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,299
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back out to the</font>

226
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,009
community but just letting people

227
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:03,040
understand we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have a choice</font>

228
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:06,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">or obligated by the direction of the</font>

229
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,389
community to do this we have policies

230
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:14,379
and proposals post depletion which don't

231
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:17,110
end I pv for but provide a reasonable

232
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,209
set of policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us let</font>

233
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,489
people who have need get at address

234
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:24,910
space and encourage the return of

235
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:27,160
address space and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's reuse potentially</font>

236
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,600
even to other regions who continue to

237
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,069
subscribe to the stewardship principles

238
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,170
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got a pretty good</font>

239
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,269
balance<font color="#CCCCCC"> basilar policies we have in the</font>

240
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,529
ones in discussion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately it's</font>

241
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a few guys as to how you</font>

242
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,209
want the ipv4 address<font color="#CCCCCC"> spaces to be</font>

243
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:42,790
managed that's all I have information

244
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:46,349
page WWE aren't on that knowledge etc

245
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,349
photo to thank you

246
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:57,250
maybe so while I'm making these slides

247
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">appear I'm supposed to make you fill out</font>

248
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:07,120
the survey so you should fill out the

249
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:12,550
survey because I hear there's prizes I'm

250
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna make it not really good with pcs</font>

251
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:20,709
so aleve huh so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> steer do you remember</font>

252
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,900
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were a kid you thought oh I'll</font>

253
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,760
remember every book I ever read because

254
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,199
you only read like five of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

255
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,520
before you knew it you read a bunch of

256
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,050
books and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

257
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,449
read the book and<font color="#CCCCCC"> until you stride to</font>

258
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,969
read it again and then as an adult you

259
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,890
figured oh I'll remember every place I

260
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,580
ever worked and and everybody I ever

261
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,710
worked for for example and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wake</font>

262
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,890
up one morning at nanog 51 and you

263
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,900
realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only did you work with</font>

264
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elise a really long time ago on the</font>

265
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,620
NSFNET but you actually worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for her</font>

266
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,620
and completely had forgotten about it

267
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,199
that was my morning anyway Elise is in

268
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:04,260
charge of the ayana and she's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

269
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,260
give us some insight<font color="#E5E5E5"> on ipv4 depletion</font>

270
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually didn't know Kathy worked for</font>

271
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,870
me that's news I know I have to

272
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell the story so Cathy did work for me</font>

273
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,790
at at home networks and um she she

274
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,649
worked all these hours all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time like</font>

275

<font color="#CCCCCC">Kathy you know Kathy she's always</font>

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,029
fifty percent to everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> so she came</font>

you know heck she was there all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font>

288
00:11:53,209 --> 00:12:01,529
so that's our little history but my

289
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,029
title is ipv6 is spreading from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

290
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:05,779
center and you're probably saying so

291
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:09,480
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does that mean good question I</font>

292
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:12,120
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too so basically what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

293
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,470
wanted to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is that if</font>

294
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,730
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have the infrastructure to</font>

295
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:20,250
support ipv6 things are just going to

296
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,779
break and most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who use the</font>

297
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,800
network don't care about the

298
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:27,540
infrastructure and what we just heard

299
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,819
from John is all about the policies of

300
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,819
some of the parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the infrastructure</font>

301
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,410
he addresses and the speaker after me is

302
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,360
going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commercial part</font>

303
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,680
of the addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is nanog</font>

304
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,470
network operators groups so what I

305
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,329
wanted to talk about was operating some

306
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,949
of the parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network the center</font>

307
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:48,959
of the network in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

308
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:53,670
I do assume that we do have some

309
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,119
operators here so if not this probably

310
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,370
bore you and it'll go very fast anyway

311
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,990
but that I can and I Anna one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

312
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,269
things were interested in other than

313
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:07,160
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers is the domain name system</font>

314
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:10,019
and the dome domain name system has

315
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,050
components that are dependent on ipv6

316
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,449
also because after all if you send a

317
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,779
domain name and all it does is resolve

318
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:22,279
to an ipv4 address

319
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:24,170
and their services or end systems or

320
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,749
something else out there that oh my gosh

321
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,939
couldn't get an ipv4 address and they

322
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:31,790
only have an ipv6 address or they only

323
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:33,469
have connectivity over ipv6 what the

324
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,649
heck is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name system going to</font>

325
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:39,040
do so I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

326
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,709
about that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only about four slides</font>

327
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,410
so the domain name system has this stuff

328
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:47,569
called ipv6 glue it you know has glue

329
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:52,579
for ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> too but i'm not talking about</font>

330
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:56,870
ipv4 today and it took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a while to get</font>

331
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:59,209
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> head around ipv6 glue and ipv4 glue</font>

332
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,829
and so I thought of a joke kathy will

333
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:02,540
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> it maybe bill Norton will</font>

334
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:07,248
remember he probably even told it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at an</font>

335
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:10,339
an ugh so you know the joke is why does

336
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:12,589
the engineer run out of shampoo and it's

337
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:16,189
because he followed the directions<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

338
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:18,379
wash rinse repeat so I thought ah that's

339
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:20,540
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what glues all about it's this</font>

340
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:23,120
loop if you don't have the glue you

341
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:27,129
don't you have this resolving loop and

342
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,329
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get your name resolved so</font>

343
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:33,129
nobody laughs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably was a</font>

344
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:33,128
bill Norton joke but anyway

345
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:46,810
so anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan and Katie JP and Katie</font>

346
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:50,170
were the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds that actually were</font>

347
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:54,670
aggressive in this area and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

348
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:58,029
they put ipv6 glue in the root zone way

349
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:00,490
back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2004 and that was pretty</font>

350
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:02,320
optimistic you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really believed</font>

351
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,269
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there would be a transition a lot</font>

352
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">faster and people would start adopting</font>

353
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:10,360
and enabling their infrastructure well

354
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,510
now there are two hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ninety-two</font>

355
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,000
glue records<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there 296 this</font>

356
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:19,269
slide was made bike around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

357
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">January and as of the 31st there's 296</font>

358
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:24,970
in the root zone so people have gotten

359
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea finally it's you know becoming</font>

360
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,779
a little more clear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

361
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:32,229
infrastructure people and the operators

362
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:36,180
that up there are ipv6 stuff out there

363
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:39,820
and so we need to put this glue in place

364
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:43,800
well one way of measuring how successful

365
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:47,170
that is or isn't is not by saying okay

366
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,829
do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nameservers have glue another way</font>

367
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:55,959
of saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay are they accessible via</font>

368
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:58,739
ipv6 and this map kind of indicates

369
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:03,670
which parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

370
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:07,390
have accessibility via and diversity of

371
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:10,899
ipv6 2 nameservers so it doesn't have a

372
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:15,640
color code on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I noticed the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reds are</font>

373
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bad ones they have zero diversity or</font>

374
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 connectivity for their name servers</font>

375
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,990
and then it goes orange has better that

376
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,950
means they maybe have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some</font>

377
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:31,490
yellow it gets a little better yet

378
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:34,850
and I mean it's red orange yellow and

379
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,830
then green so you might think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that okay</font>

380
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,020
what is green that must be really really

381
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">good so green means that you know you</font>

382
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:44,150
have diversity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excess by three or</font>

383
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,240
four different means not<font color="#CCCCCC"> much more than</font>

384
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:49,880
that so we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> from zero to four if it's</font>

385
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:55,250
good for diversity and that's kind of

386
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:58,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the map looks today and of</font>

387
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root DNS servers to</font>

388
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,140
have this glue in it it's a hierarchy

389
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,240
you're all operators you know DNS is a

390
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,220
hierarchy and so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to have it</font>

391
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the root or you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have it in the</font>

392
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:14,420
root then you've got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds which I</font>

393
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:16,040
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier and than anybody</font>

394
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,720
else that runs name servers should also

395
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:23,389
be aware of having ipv6 glue so right

396
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:29,270
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are nine root DNS servers that</font>

397
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:34,400
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 glue since January and that's</font>

398
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:37,850
good it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bad it's good and all of</font>

399
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,570
this I'm getting from the URL that's up

400
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:47,959
there the root servers org and this is a

401
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:50,240
map of DNS that's served over ipv6 and

402
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,970
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only as their</font>

403
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,560
ipv6 enabled but there's ipv6

404
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,690
connectivity if you don't have the

405
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:01,040
transport or the peering between your

406
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS name server and something else that</font>

407
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,970
talks ipv6 it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter</font>

408
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,650
you're kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to yourself</font>

409
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:14,480
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> cares but these root servers can</font>

410
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:17,930
resolve the ipv6 addresses with peers

411
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,220
and for more detail you'd have to go to

412
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> site because these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bubbles</font>

413
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,500
are kind of small but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

414
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,110
just a promo for those of you that

415
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,500
operate networks and name servers that

416
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:33,409
if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered implementing</font>

417
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,640
you know ipv6 glue<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your name server</font>

418
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,630
you should

419
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:49,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to thank you very much and</font>

420
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:53,720
it's nice to be here again more did the

421
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:59,120
little thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> go really did i mention</font>

422
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i don't like pcs um holding my mac</font>

423

is just really happy and how do you make

424
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:13,399
this full screen slideshow f5 where's

totally do um so when I met Dan he was

429
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,630
in an errand meeting and he stood up six

430
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:35,120
years ago there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

431
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,600
yeah and he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there should be an</font>

432
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,820
open market for IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

433
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,909
caused quite a stir<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ER peaceful</font>

434
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:47,899
little errand community and we were

435
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:53,030
there was much arguing that ensued that

436
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:56,420
day anyway dan is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a managing director at</font>

was a very strongly carrier centric

469
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:38,239
event I think in recent years there's

470
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,339
been a real shift to content providers

471
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:42,080
and looking out over the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

and these go from hosting providers who

have a billion dollars in revenue we got

<font color="#CCCCCC">for say broadband provider the question</font>

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,390
is you know what if you weren't getting

<font color="#E5E5E5">you had 11 thousands as many customers</font>

518
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,250
but they paid you a thousand times as

519
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:43,280
much the average managed hosting revenue

straight up from there the tolerance for

out of ipv4 space and some of them made

549
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,220
dire predictions that turned out not to

550

starts to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center so the perspective and</font>

555
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,000
I surveyed about a half dozen from

<font color="#E5E5E5">relatively small 10 million ish revenue</font>

to very large hosting providers and I

got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of good sound bites a lot of</font>

559
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,959
information one of the better quotes I

560
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,550
got was the customer experience is not

561
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,070
about the packet being shipped to them

562
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,320
it's about end-to-end experience from

563
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:32,720
typing in the URL to application

564
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,850
delivery and that means these guys are

held accountable<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that whole value</font>

necessarily the older stuff everything

581
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,290
else is hard so the servers on the

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,300
network with each party you might say

583
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,850
what else is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there other than servers</font>

584
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:26,149
and network sadly there is a lot other

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:29,178
than servers and network first OSS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:31,250
billing systems are still primarily ipv4

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,790
people bill on so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

pieces of equipment that you might say

a market lack of confidence in these

606
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,659
devices in particular as they support

607
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,689
tens of thousands of servers and hosted

608
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:24,090
environments and the thing I heard

609
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:27,179
repeatedly from hosting providers large

610
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:32,070
and small was the need for real ipv4 to

611
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:34,890
ipv6 net in a shipped proven scalable

612

hardware solution hosting for vendors in

613
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:41,460
the audience hosting providers are not

614
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:46,799
feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the love here you are turned</font>

615
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:48,780
Avon yeah um in your thing there you see

616
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,030
there is no carrier grade map is that

617
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,158
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does are people saying it</font>

618
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,320
doesn't exist or<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't need it for</font>

619
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,720
both know people are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

620
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,520
no shipping solution that gives them

<font color="#E5E5E5">what they need today to installing your</font>

623
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,000

624
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,428
I think it's a security appliance

625
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,289
sometimes um but it looks like what

626
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:12,240
you're you know that your picture looks

627
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,429
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means a protocol translation</font>

628
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">right dad that's what we what they are</font>

629
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:17,640
saying is NAT what they mean it's

630
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,530
protocol translation the kind of folks

631
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,539
I'm talking to or not guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

632
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:24,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting that for security I music roots</font>

633
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:27,530
of a hundred thousand servers they you

634
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:30,299
know they do get it so it's it's

635
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,549
translation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is translation but</font>

636
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:34,830
I think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks who</font>

637
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:36,510
work for vendors here is they're not

638
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,280
probably going to say translation

639
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,580
they're probably going to say nap

640
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,500
because that's what they say so if

641
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,299
somebody says that I think it behooves

642
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,830
you to to do what Dave just did and

643
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,990
drill down a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what</font>

644
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,990
they really do want is the magic

645
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,580
protocol translation box and it doesn't

646
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,440
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be a monolithic</font>

647
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,389
device you know for the hosting

648
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,280
providers it doesn't need to be one box

649
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,750
that sits at the very edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

network

a lot of them if only they'd be very

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to have more smaller boxes that</font>

653
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,820
they can put in front of individual

654
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:11,000
customers to enable separate compliance

655
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,919
and billing requirements one more thing

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll most often even</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the dead horse er um the reason that we</font>

658
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,419
need this is because the perception is

659
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,270
there that the world is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP you</font>

660
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,250
before still no not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I mean</font>

661
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,160
there's really a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons this is</font>

662
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,320
this is needed one<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is because at</font>

663
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,300
some point in the future these folks

664
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,970
won't be able to get ipv4 addresses

665
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,930
sometime very soon at that point what

666
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,830
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do is</font>

667
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,320
they're going to be able to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on an</font>

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,230
RFC 1918 address and they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

669
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,929
put on an a ipv6 address and they're

670
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:48,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need you know folks to be able</font>

671
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:50,600
to get access to these servers who are

672
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,540
sitting on ipv4 endpoints or who have

673
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,000
sort of fractured ipv6 connectivity and

674
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,940
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write over ipv4 networks these</font>

675
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,010
folks also desperately need the ability

676
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:04,430
for someone who is for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> on an</font>

677
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,260
ipv6 endpoint to reach legacy ipv4

678
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:09,110
content because these guys have a lot of

679
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:12,140
servers 10,000 20,000 30,000 servers

680
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,629
that were installed before ipv6 became a

681
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,910
real reality and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take in</font>

682
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,980
some cases three or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years for these</font>

683
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:22,070
servers to slowly be moved out of

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">service and it's unlikely that folks are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go and put ipv6 on these</font>

because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk of disruption is just</font>

00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,860
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so Jason shall arise in</font>

688
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,600
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> a yet I'm a little confused</font>

689
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,429
about what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying because it</font>

690
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,909
sounds to me the solution you described

691
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:39,980
is deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack ipv6 and when you</font>

692
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,430
run out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of before addresses start</font>

693
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,140
deploying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that 44 so I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

694
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,470
understand where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the conclusion</font>

695
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,970
of we need a protocol translator um it's

696
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">not my with all due respect it's not my</font>

697
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:55,550
conclusion this is the conclusion from

698
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,000
you know relatively large hosting

699
00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,520
company engineering staffs that they

700
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,080
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is is a necessary</font>

701
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,269
instrument and they don't

702
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,449
either they're not educated<font color="#CCCCCC"> although</font>

703
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:12,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">somewhere in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or they disagree</font>

704
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:14,179
with you so and in fact you may want to

705
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,760
talk to the verizon business hosting

706
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:21,470
guys because they may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not agree with you</font>

707
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:25,370
so I'm sorry I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking the other bar</font>

708
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:27,679
or it's a transition mechanism that many

709
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:30,018
of these guys since they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not prepared</font>

710
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,630
for v6 on their server infrastructure

711
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:33,590
are trying to patch things together or

712
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,389
think they'll need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch things</font>

713
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,549
together to do that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what you</font>

714
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:40,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">said which is let those be four machines</font>

715
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:42,590
slowly cycle out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there made it cycle</font>

716
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,630
instead of necessarily trying to the

717
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,699
dual stack the machines themselves yeah

729
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,658
a significant number of them believe

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are not prices out there</font>

I've not tested any of them yet but

733
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:15,799
there are several vendors they claim

734
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:18,380
that they do so maybe they have done

state your name and affiliation when you

738
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:26,480
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main concern isn't that there</font>

739
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,908
are vendors out there claiming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

740
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,909
can do this I think the concerns<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

741
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:33,889
that the devices aren't proven and their

can tell you that from a hosting

752

perspective some of the driver for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

is many many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> many applications</font>

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one which is enough break</font>

756
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:11,590
horribly if you enable dual stack on the

757
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,210
machine because the stuff that works

758

fine with<font color="#CCCCCC"> before was never tested with</font>

tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things and it doesn't work</font>

to do with hosting do you think that

772
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,650
there's going to be a market that

773
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:53,020
emerges or has it already emerged during

774
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:56,080
your discussions with these guys where

775
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,179
they're going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling v4 as a</font>

776
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,960
value-added service and basically spin

777
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:03,280
up a vm and you get v6 by default and

778
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,559
you're paying them something's orbiting

779
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,679
for you to get before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

780
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had some surprising interactions for</font>

781
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,270
these folks regarding some economic

782
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:15,190
issues the most surprising was asked

783
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,889
them do you plan on buying v4 addresses

784
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,290
they almost all said no which was which

785
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,649
was a bit shocking on the second was you

786
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,820
know do you plan on offering you know

787
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:27,730
differentiated levels of service for v4

788
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus v6 um that had not occurred to</font>

789
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,330
most of them it's kind of that's that's

790
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:35,009
kind of surprising because I would

791
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:37,389
almost figure that you know it's your

792
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,399
providers for years of charge more you

793
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:40,960
know that the sailboat slide small

794
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:43,029
business providers charge more for years

795
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,540
for say static ip's so I can certainly

796
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,129
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys gravitating towards but I</font>

797
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,210
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in mind is when</font>

798
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,618
you're already charging someone a

799
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,590
thousand dollars for a managed server

800
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:55,629
every month or more and you say now it's

801
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:58,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500 if you want an ipv4</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">advantage of that and smash you because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">serious</font>

807

right yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some degree also i</font>

808
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,290
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

between someone paying 995 for a web

hosting account and a thousand dollars a

811

814
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what are the top concerns the</font>

815
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,260
top concerns this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slap at</font>

816
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,940
carriers but I the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing I heard</font>

817
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,220
repeatedly was the carriers are not seen

818
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,730
as being particularly useful in the

819
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,319
context of the ipv6 transition you know

820
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,700
one person told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they did not</font>

821
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,770
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the carrier's would be taking</font>

825
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,310
was a particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> harsh an amusing</font>

826
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:55,140
statement I think he's in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room the</font>

827
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,390
patchwork the other the other big

00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,990
concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard was that the patchwork</font>

829
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,430
of ipv6 at carrier networks was a real

concern some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other words end-to-end</font>

831
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:08,879
delivery<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh not their tunnels you know</font>

832
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,970
with the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of optimal traffic</font>

833
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,310
delivery that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is found in ipv4 carrier</font>

834
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:17,129
networks not just on one network but

835
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:19,529
from network to network network from end

836
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,970
to end that was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern and the</font>

837
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,280
concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't that the packet wouldn't</font>

838
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,930

839
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,750
path of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> delivery would be less</font>

840
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,790
optimal than we see today in ipv4

841
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,930
networks which worked really really well

842
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,300
and you may say but it's the same

843
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,799
network I think those concerns that if

844
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,170
there's one network on the path that

845
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,290
isn't doing things properly or there's a

846
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,820
situation appearing point this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a</font>

847
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,050
concern that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks have because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this isn't something that's in their</font>

849
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:48,260
control there are also scaling concerns

850
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,370
with ipv6 around software and hardware

851
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,920
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part these folks are saying</font>

852
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:55,380
yes everything's everything I have

853
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,230
supports<font color="#E5E5E5"> V says that checkbox is there</font>

854
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,480
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the primary concern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it</font>

855
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,730
supports it a trap at this traffic level

856
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,220
at this load level is it going to scale

857
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,220
well I'm out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pjs here but but scaling</font>

858
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:11,370
is a concern with these folks and

00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,660
stuff gets deployed widely and rapidly

861
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,879
there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

862
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,440
very fast series of patches and a

863
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,599
software upgrades that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll</font>

864
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,180
out at a pace that we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen in</font>

865
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:27,280
quite a while you know for a long time I

866
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,140
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software that we've used has</font>

867
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,940
been relatively stable and there's

concern that we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> going will be going</font>

stacking up multiple points of failure

878
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:56,470
troubleshooting is a big concern for

879
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,089
these folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the reason</font>

880
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,578
troubleshooting is a concern and this is

881
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:03,160
the most often mentioned concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

882
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:06,220
was mentioned repeatedly as a source of

883
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,930
worry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the thing that came up</font>

884
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,750
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again was how will technical</font>

885
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:13,538
staff differentiate between an ipv4

886
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,980
problem in an ipv6 problem that was a

887
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:17,289
concern that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the troubleshooting tools</font>

888
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,940
aren't in place to do that and how do

889
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:20,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if if this is an application</font>

890
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,650
issue how do you know if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

891
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:27,879
issue with ipv6 ipv4 the interaction

892
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:30,339
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two of DNS this is a concern</font>

893
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,990
but in addition I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

894
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:34,900
concern about you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day after</font>

895
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:37,299
addressing servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ipv6 only possibly</font>

896
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,339
this is ameliorated to a certain point

897
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:42,009
because many hosting providers already

898
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:43,930
have RFC 1918 addresses on all of their

899
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,940
servers and are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some kind of</font>

900
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,430
address translation already so this

901
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,690
becomes somewhat less of a concern but

902
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,730
they're certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

903
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,160

904
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:56,200

networks for individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> reachability</font>

906

<font color="#E5E5E5">forward in conclusion I think we've had</font>

very rapidly probably twenty percent

year-over-year in terms of revenue

the hardware vendors and scaling

938
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:18,409
concerns are the top solvable issues and

939
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:21,678
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the major takeaway for my</font>

research in this area is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these folks are prepared for a major</font>

942
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:28,339
period of instability and by instability

943
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:31,130
I don't mean you know does the internet

944
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:34,119
work today I mean right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the internet</font>

945
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:37,279
is extremely stable in comparison to say

946
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,719
1998 or 1999 I think there's a concern

947
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:40,369
that we're that for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years</font>

948
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to be turning back the clock</font>

00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:44,809
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit in terms of reach ability</font>

950
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:47,239
tough to troubleshoot problems and

951
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:49,579
they'll be generally be lower customer

satisfaction for for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next several</font>

953
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:55,249
years as this transition occurs and

954
00:40:52,689 --> 00:41:02,790
that's all I've got any questions

955
00:40:55,249 --> 00:41:05,348
comments concerns Dave Meyer um

956
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:10,200
what does they like to give my<font color="#CCCCCC"> iaj with</font>

957
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:13,630
that working yeah go ahead Randy yeah oh

958
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,649
no I'm sorry um again a couple questions

959
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:19,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">for you the first one is you talk about</font>

960
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,310
potential instability and this is mostly

961
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,990
because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> coach just doesn't work</font>

962
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,369
that well and you have to run it a long

963
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:28,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">time before it starts working better</font>

964
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:29,830
yeah but especially not hosting or at

965
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:33,010
least in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that large state of large-scale</font>

966
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:34,840
data center world a lot of the network

967
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:37,180
world is gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sucked back up into it</font>

968
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,880
actually to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the huffs into the servers</font>

969
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,618
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you have bunch</font>

970
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,170
of ems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have actually original</font>

971
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:47,109
solution that my professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but</font>

972
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:49,930
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that aspect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ipv6 thing</font>

973
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:52,270
is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as unstable as you're</font>

974
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:54,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">perceived as people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are perceiving I I</font>

975
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,990
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's his unstable and the</font>

976
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,560
key issue with almost all of this stuff

977
00:41:55,990 --> 00:42:01,899
is age it's how all the stuff is and how

978
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,740
close when the stuff was sort of

979
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:07,990
instantiated to today so most of the

980
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,819
cloud stuff and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the virtual stop</font>

981
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,189
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hosted private cloud is a</font>

982
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,349
variety of services most of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

983
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:18,099
actually relative relatively recent

984
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:20,020
vintage<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and so my personal opinion</font>

985
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:21,700
and I have no science behind this that

986
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:26,470
that stuff will probably work a little

987
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:28,509
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better whereas you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose had a</font>

988
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:32,348
server sitting in a Colo for five years

989
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,970
it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> in much bigger trouble but</font>

990
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,680
I've no science for that because I don't

991
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they'll know until we see more</font>

992
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,839
implementation yeah okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

993
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:42,820
one other thing um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

I flooded it with some of my colleagues

1007
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:19,170
seems to be around the fact that the the

asked me there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of focus on the</font>

what what the alternative future

on and then all I'll turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> over to John</font>

1031
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,390
this thing we've argued about for many

1032
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,379
years III don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any</font>

1033
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:22,859
question if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at a broad swath of</font>

00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:29,220
we utilized as a community to distribute

00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,598
we're finite resource but really were a

00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:35,130
finite resource that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the method we used</font>

1039
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,049
for destroying a finite resource was

1040
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,140
perhaps one of the most sub-optimal

1041
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:42,030
methods for finite resource distribution

1042
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:45,650
that that exists in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

understanding of how economics works

about what the most optimum methods of

there are reasonable mediation

develop his cell ipv4 I think there will

over time be a thriving market<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ipv4 I</font>

00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,569

<font color="#E5E5E5">there'll be things that you have to use</font>

1059
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:30,420
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the beauty is that our method of</font>

1060
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,098
ipv4 distribution was so inefficient

1061
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,710
that I believe there are actually lots

1062
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,940
and lots of unused ipv4 out there I

1063
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,190
think there's lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> research showing</font>

1064
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,829
this is true on the routing table and I

1065
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that will keep ipv4 prices low in</font>

okay so I don't know whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you</font>

1068
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,710
you said it's a crisis and

1069
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,119
self-governance it I if that's what

1070
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,240
you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really don't believe</font>

1071
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so the community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has</font>

1072
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,848
adopted policies that say you can

1073
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:08,220
transfer address space but the only

1074
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:10,650
parties that can receive it are ones

1075
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,930
that still have documented need our FC

1076
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,569
2050 actually says transfers have to

1077
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:18,480
occur but transfers can occur between

1078
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:22,140
parties to someone who still has need

1079
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,329
now that does preclude speculators it

1080
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,098
does preclude brokers to some extent

1081
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:27,960
since the transfer has to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

1082
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,240
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going to make use of it but</font>

1083
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,490
the reality is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a mechanism</font>

1084
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,009
in place now that's actually a market

1085
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:38,009
mechanism because it is quite possible

1086
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:40,260
for parties that have address space they

1087
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,119
don't need a lot of these folks turned

1091
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:51,150

1092
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,129
didn't need it and they realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

1093
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,890
for the community but for the folks who

didn't well the folks who need to do a

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work to free up the address space</font>

of a market system post run out in place

1103
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,250
today we'd like to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that</font>

1104
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,740
works among all the regions because that

00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:25,530
should be that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious that all</font>

00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,839
regions<font color="#CCCCCC"> should benefit equally but the</font>

1107
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:30,420
fact of the matter is that when you say

1108
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,280
what alternative mechanisms I don't know

1109
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,200
what you'd be proposing but you know the

public policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list is open and</font>

off um i-i've to see I do think there's

1114
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:50,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">a role here for brokers I don't think I</font>

1115
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,399
and I think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be important</font>

1116
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:55,950
if the expectation from<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin is that</font>

1117
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,570
people will randomly find each other you

1118
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:59,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">know who need address space I think</font>

1119
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:02,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's unlikely I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bruegger's don't</font>

1120
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,950
have to buy a resource to sell it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

1121
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:07,529
think there's a valuable there's a need

1122
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:10,680
in the community for<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks to say I know</font>

1123
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:12,420
of people who have this inventory and

1124
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,700
service that's available for that

1125
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,560
purpose yeah and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think more than a</font>

1126
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,509
listing service I think we're going to

1127
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,670
need you know motivated middlemen who

1128
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:22,859
can take a you know ten percent of the

1129
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,650
deal I think it's very reasonable thing

1130
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:27,869
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think that rule is none</font>

1131
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:30,780
of errands business no offense whether

1132
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:32,820
brokers have an appropriate role one of

1133

the interesting aspects is in John you

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,169
oversight role but you're not a

1140
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,899
signatory to the contract Patrick<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1141
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,930
right or am I wrong the transfer is

1142
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:00,510
something that goes the you may have a

1143
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:02,279
contract between<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mm-hmm I'm not a</font>

1144
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:03,660
party to that contract okay that's also

1145
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,310
not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract that these defense are</font>

1146
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,500
happened mm-hmm the transfer happens

1147
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:09,359
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the agreement with them well</font>

1148
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,980
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys it's no different from</font>

1149
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,450
selling a house that right no it's a

1150
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,660
huge difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well you actually</font>

1151
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:17,480
he actually puts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a transfer</font>

1152
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,700
us to receive or whoever's receiving to

1153
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,070
receive those addresses right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1154
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,020
that does or doesn't go through and then

1155
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:28,070
you can pay him or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you actually</font>

1156
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:29,630
never do a bill a sip but why I

1157
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:31,370
certainly understand that but but

1158
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:34,130
essentially you guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> acting as a</font>

1159
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:37,940
title authority and it is sort of a

1160
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:39,290
zoning regulator rather than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

1161
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,370
you have an agreement with him you

1162
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,830
haven't agree with them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

1163
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:44,270
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to answer ok I think that's</font>

1164
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,680
fair we don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what you guys</font>

1165
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:47,180
have between each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want to</font>

1166
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,430
know what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between all we know</font>

1167
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is security set policies those policies</font>

1168
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:54,589
say when we can do a transfer hmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1169
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:57,370
we change records when what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you show up</font>

1170
00:49:54,590 --> 00:50:00,830
it matches the<font color="#CCCCCC"> commission so you will</font>

1171
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:03,109
you will guarantee that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the CEO of</font>

1172
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:04,700
Aaron that one of your analysts will not

1173
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,470
ask to see the contract between two

1174
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,899
private parties for the transfer space

1175
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:12,049
we follow the policies in the NR p.m.

1176
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,790
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> F currently says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> un will say yes</font>

1177
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:16,520
and he has to say yes that's what we do

1178
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:19,730
it doesn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation of a</font>

1179
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:22,360
sale did you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little transfer we</font>

1180
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:25,040
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> send Elise wants to say something</font>

1181
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:29,510
anyway it's a fascinating conversation

1182
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:32,480
and we're supposedly operators here and

1183
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:35,030
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how do we manage a</font>

1184
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,890
finite resource but i think the other

1185
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:39,050
points that came up in the conversation

1186
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,879
from dan is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much about this</font>

1187
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,890
marketplace that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure you get the</font>

1188
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,510
microphone want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but i</font>

1189
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wanted to bring us back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the fact</font>

1190
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:50,170
that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a finite resource the world</font>

1191
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:54,049
has a population of 7 billion people

1192
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:56,420
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only about 3.5 billion ipv4</font>

1193
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:59,300
addresses that means if everybody wanted

1194
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,490
an ipv4 address for their cell phone not

1195
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,160
everybody in the world could have one so

1196
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:07,040
we could sell and trade<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do whatever</font>

1197
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,930
we wanted with ipv4 but we do have to

1198
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,600
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other parts of the</font>

1199
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,390
presentations that talked about what

1200
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,580
vendor support infrastructure

1201
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:17,350
support you know what do we do for what

1202
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,960
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an infinite resource today</font>

1203
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:21,670
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the ipv6 pool and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted</font>

1204
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to bring us back to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even though I</font>

1205
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,140
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fascinating discussion</font>

1206
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:27,250
but keep in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mind that is operators</font>

1207
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,319
you really have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1208
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:31,810
infrastructure and and what you're going

1209
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:34,240
to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have servers support it and</font>

1210
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:36,610
the hosting sites supported because that

1211
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,580
is the infinite resource and you can buy

1212
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:41,380
and sell in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interim are we sure ipv6</font>

1213
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,660
is infinite because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a time we</font>

1214
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,070
swore no I'm serious I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

1215
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:49,690
getting I'm crazy night it was a time we

1216
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:51,610
swore i do but i did say it looks in it

1217
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:54,490
I didn't say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously it's not it's</font>

1218
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">a certainly closer to infinite but not</font>

1219
00:51:54,490 --> 00:52:00,399
who and I expect to be retired before

1220
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:04,030
all ipv6 goes out yeah there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1221
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that feel that way um avi I have</font>

1222
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,450
such great respect for both of the

1223
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:10,090
gentleman who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> engaged in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

1224
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:11,799
but we're both<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong leader you are</font>

1225
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:14,350
wrong so I'll say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both of you are</font>

1226
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,600
somewhat were correct and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1227
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:18,150
clearly given the the framework of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1228
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,110
community I think the community is

1229
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:21,750
continued we have an active role in

1230
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:24,040
setting what they want to have happen

1231
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,300
and it's unlikely that you're gonna have

1232
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,620
workers that take possession and

1233
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,030
ownership of address space because they

1234
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,100
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get it transferred to</font>

1235
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:31,930
them unless they make stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and write</font>

1236
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,240
programs to generate fake<font color="#CCCCCC"> network maps</font>

1237
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:38,230
and all that on the other hand on the

1238
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:40,629
other hand I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that right I think</font>

1239
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that for the four things to operate</font>

1240
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,500
efficiently there needs to be something

1241
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is perhaps even more than just a</font>

1242
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,070
listing service and perhaps actually

1243
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that facilitates the buyers</font>

1244
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:51,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sellers and figuring out what the</font>

1245
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,380
supply is and what price people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1246
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,300
going to bid and ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> at and there's</font>

1247
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,400
always it's difficult to actually see

1248
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,200
how you could avoid letting someone

1249
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,310
speculate on that on that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1250
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,379
infrastructure even if they couldn't

1251
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,540
take possession but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll sort of leave</font>

1252
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,220
that aside so my question is what is

1253
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,740
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> listing service to which you refer</font>

1254
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:11,649
and does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone aware of anything</font>

1255
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:14,080
slightly more whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's market like</font>

1256
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,940
or ebay like or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sato like or whatever</font>

1257
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is evolving because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1258
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,309
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that where there are</font>

1259
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,598
people

1260
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:21,910
who know who the suppliers and buyers

1261
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,689
are and assist but don't get in the

1262
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:27,759
middle of the transactions so um

1263
00:53:24,689 --> 00:53:29,439
specified transfer listing service is

1264
00:53:27,759 --> 00:53:31,599
document on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Iron website it's</font>

1265
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:34,930
basically a list of those parties who

1266
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:37,119
say they are have address space that

1267
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:38,439
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could make available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they may</font>

1268
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">not have it available now but they might</font>

1269
00:53:38,439 --> 00:53:41,680
have to do some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

1270
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:42,999
space they could make available will

1271
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,348
validate that there the whole dorm

1272
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:46,419
record because that's kind of convenient

1273
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:48,339
and then on the other side parties who

1274
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,809
say I have a need it's been approved<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1275
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:52,900
Aaron but Aaron doesn't have the

1276
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:54,369
resources so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't approved me I am</font>

1277
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,799

1278
00:53:54,369 --> 00:54:00,660
transfer and all we're doing is making

1279
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:03,489
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those lists available nothing says</font>

1280
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,890
money nothing says how much it's just

1281
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:07,930
contact information for parties to find

1282
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:11,229
each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly to facilitate a</font>

1283
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:15,609
broker an ebay on someone else so it's

1284
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:18,459
we we implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information that's</font>

1285
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:21,459
needed so the part of the community can

1286
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:22,808
find each other and make that happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1287
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:24,698
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to set that up that's</font>

1288
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:25,959
most certainly not our role if you'll

1289
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:31,150
excuse me I'm gonna go start writing

1290
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:34,118
some code great<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris Chris is moral so</font>

1291
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:36,039
um the transfer thing doesn't have to be

1292
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:39,339
an actual transfer though right when I

1293
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:40,809
can say to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my friend Jason I I would</font>

team won with a / 24 assigned to it

1296
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:49,509
right right so I mean that if your

1297
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:52,689
question is under the transfer policy on

1298
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:54,849
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> specified transfer as long as you</font>

00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:57,699
either get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from Aaron or if you can't</font>

1301
00:54:56,469 --> 00:54:59,799
you can get it for any party<font color="#CCCCCC"> who can</font>

00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it available right Lena like I said</font>

you're saying friends for address space

1311
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:18,489
you would have to qualify under the NR

1312
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:19,599
p.m. to receive the space what I'm

1313
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:21,489

gonna use and I'll spend an absurd

1321
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:35,770
amount of money part right now Atkinson

1322
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:37,420
let's talk about that so a transfer is

1323
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:39,400
when we actually update the old record

1324
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,590
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry very simple stuff yes</font>

1325
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,290
but it's possible for you to make use of

1326
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:46,720
address space and never transfer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1327
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,790
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now that's something that</font>

1328
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron doesn't we don't Penny's beninese</font>

1332
00:55:56,170 --> 00:56:01,390
and decide if thats fraudulent we would

1333
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:03,420
need crystal clear guidance before we

1334
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:06,730
walked over into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the realm</font>

1335
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:10,120
right and I into<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry in one less thing</font>

1336
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:11,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elise's point about we should also</font>

1337
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,150
talk about v6 I think one important

1338
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,440
thing is there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little there's lots of</font>

1339
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,270
infrastructure and some of it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

1340
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,130
about its servers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcs of things</font>

1341
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:20,050
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of embedded infrastructure</font>

1342
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,610
that will never<font color="#E5E5E5"> see these things and it</font>

1343
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:24,270

1344
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:27,400

1345
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:29,970
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be addressed right</font>

1346
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:33,400
they currently have addresses on them

1347
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:35,680
they said passage amor you think of a

1348
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,890
collateralized IP address obligation

1349
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:40,960
where I borrowed a bunch of / 24 is from

1350
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:43,950
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this room and then</font>

1351
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:47,470
in turn lent it to another end user and

1352
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:50,080
it never look well and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never then</font>

1353
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:51,850
actually you know transfer it if you

1354
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:55,450
attempt the transfer that doesn't match

1355
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:57,610
the policies we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> noted as regionals</font>

00:56:55,450 --> 00:57:00,160
fraud and return and reclaim them give

1357
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:01,990
them someone who does if you don't

1358
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,500
attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the registry of record</font>

1359
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:07,779
that's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you it's only when someone</font>

1360
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,910
tries to change what's in who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so the</font>

1361
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:12,150
whole record that we make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:14,680
pass the policies service providers

1363
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:17,850
provide some addresses is not a seraph

1364
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:20,850
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> less illegal internet society</font>

the deck<font color="#CCCCCC"> chairs are lovely are they not</font>

1366
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:25,089
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should create a repository to</font>

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> list all the possible</font>

1368
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:30,040
configurations and rearrangements we can

00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,960
make of them a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> less flippantly</font>

1370
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,820
I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Elise is getting at</font>

1371
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I certainly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supported even while</font>

00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:51,490
ipv4 as if you know creating listing

1378

<font color="#CCCCCC">well somehow make it the solution for</font>

1381
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,090
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at just exactly how much</font>

1382
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:04,060
infrastructure is needed in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:07,450
handling transfers reasonably and

1384
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:09,880
effectively so that we can move on to

1385
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:12,640
ipv6 but the more energy you put into

1386
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,380
building you know the best buttress ipv4

1387
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,779
transfer mechanisms for all the edge

1388
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,430
cases we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly contemplate the</font>

less energy we're putting and realizing

1390
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:23,740
that the sick this ship is sinking and

1391
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:26,950
we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to the lifeboats III</font>

1392
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:29,830
disagree very strongly and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

1393
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:33,100
why is because if Aaron is going to

1394
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain its stewardship then it</font>

1395
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:38,830
desperately needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ensure that all of</font>

1396
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:41,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stakeholders involved have accesses</font>

1397
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:43,840
have access to the resources they need

1398
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,160
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition and if they fail</font>

1399
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,610
to do so and there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> times in</font>

1400
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,319
the past when the the Aaron membership

1401
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:52,300
sort of the people who show up to

1402
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,510
meetings have been very blind to this

1403
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,980
and have taken that<font color="#E5E5E5"> line we'll just</font>

1404
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,600
we'll just switch we'll just switch with

1405
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,150
your switch you know who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1406
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:04,270
before we need to ditch this now but

1407
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are strong commercial concerns so</font>

1408
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,800
I I understand that and I agree that

1409
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:11,890
because I'm fully supportive of having a

1410
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,930
robust and reliable allocation and

1411
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:16,660
management system for for all the good

1412
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:19,089
reasons however my point is to not

1413
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">fixate on that to the point where we</font>

1414
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">overlook the need to just move on</font>

1415
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:27,940
because polishing this one to perfection

1416
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:30,069
is not doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community any services</font>

1417

brave enough to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that as a</font>

guess he left the microphones only oh

1435
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:12,070
yeah I'm yeah I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> kuna from the ripe NCC</font>

1436
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,810
one of the other five hours and I'm

actually only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the messenger here I have</font>

1438
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:18,790
a question you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan from daniel karen</font>

1439
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,950
berg also from the ripe NCC and he's

1440
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:23,350
asking him you mentioned them a lot of

1441
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,240
economic research I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing that the</font>

1442
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:27,880
ipv4 address space distribution has been

1443
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:30,310
done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in the most inefficient</font>

1444
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,710
way as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible i think was you were</font>

1445
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:34,150
your wording and he's asking am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1446
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:36,160
it's best if a little bit more what kind

1447
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:39,370
of research there was and what you bet

1448
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,870
you used exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know 2x actually</font>

1449
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:42,430
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> my wording but what i said was</font>

1450
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:45,759
that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a tremendous amount of</font>

1451
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:48,490
economic<font color="#CCCCCC"> research around distribution of</font>

1452
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,720
finite resources and the most efficient

1453
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:55,450
way possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send links but</font>

1454
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:58,509
this has been the subjective of reams of

1455
01:00:55,450 --> 01:01:00,460
economic research and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty well</font>

1456
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:03,010
established that free finite resource

1457
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:05,170
the most efficient method of

1458
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:07,660
distributing it as a market-based method

1459
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:10,600
rather than a sort of command based

1460
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:12,359
method or central planning method and

1461
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:15,100
you know that their folks who disagreed

1462
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:17,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I certainly acknowledge that those</font>

1463
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:19,960
folks exist but at this point in history

1464
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:21,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the weight of the the research is</font>

1465
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,849
certainly towards market rather than

1466
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:26,879
central planning based

1467
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:29,259
well let's hope there was a successful

1468
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,660
satisfy answer for Daniel and otherwise

1469
01:01:29,259 --> 01:01:34,299
i'm sure you'll follow up with you just

1470
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,038
great and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to wrap</font>

1471
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:41,069
this up so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is it</font>

1472
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:41,069
break down or yeah okay thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody</font>
