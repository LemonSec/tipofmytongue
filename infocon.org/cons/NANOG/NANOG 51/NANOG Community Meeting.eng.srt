325
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,210

327
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,470
host the mailing list in net org we're

328
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,510
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ownership of the router</font>

329
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,330
that all your traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going through</font>

330
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,280
right now those have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been used</font>

331
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,240
exclusively for net on projects for

332
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:05,230
years so makes sense we worked on

333
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:10,200
planning transition steps how to move

334
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:14,500
the data how to get everything over

335
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:17,680
don't see it mentioned here skip ahead

336
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,570
one slide to make sure actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> no a</font>

337
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,319
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the meeting was talking</font>

338
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:28,150
about an intellectual<font color="#CCCCCC"> property agreement</font>

339
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:30,100
to transfer the nanog trademark and all

340
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:35,819
the associated content that goes around

341
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:39,180
it we came to informal agreement on that

342
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,460
so that transfer will happen we expect

343
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,160
subject only to the lawyers reviewing it

344
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,430
at this point I think so keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

345
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">fingers crossed that the lawyers don't</font>

346
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:54,130
say anything we don't want we've

347
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,450
confirmed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to diamond level sponsors this</font>

348
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:00,760
is big it actually gives us a large

349
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:03,850
cushion of cash that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can use to pay</font>

350
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,309
deposits on<font color="#E5E5E5"> future hotel contracts</font>

351
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:09,669

354
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,640
our first meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon but until then we</font>

355
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:20,079
needed a reserve to work from and these

356
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,110
two sponsorships will give us the base

357
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,859
basis for that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that</font>

358
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:29,399
we're not welcoming more sponsors but

attendance and in San Francisco we also

411
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:23,020
took a initial step of meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our</font>
