00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,800
good morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hankins from brocade and I'm</font>

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,360
co-presenting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brent Van Dusen from</font>

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,170
limelight we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about some</font>

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">operational issues and some</font>

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,040
considerations for energy networks and

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,750
this is kind of I think you know the

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">first talk that I've done together with</font>

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,450
an operator typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been me</font>

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,850
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's going on the</font>

12
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,680
standards organization which has varying

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,810
degree of interests I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,488
interesting I hope you did too as well

15
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,080
over the past couple years but now that

16
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,870
the standard is actually done last

17
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">summer and we act we have shipping</font>

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">products on the market I think it's time</font>

19
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that people</font>

20
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,850
are thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when deploying this</font>

21
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,930
new technology because it is it is

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,820
available down people are actually

23
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,290
deployment so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of the</font>

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,030
general agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk a</font>

25
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,460
little bit about what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in the</font>

26
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:59,070
industry is there a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback on</font>

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,360
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

28
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,070
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the industry and then</font>

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,229
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll stand back a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

30
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Brent's going to talk about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

31
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,740
the things that they're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

32
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,030
as they start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider deploying this</font>

33
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,530
technology so basically I started to

34
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,420
kind of take a look back and think about

35
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know what problem we trying to solve</font>

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,289
here in this kind of it applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any</font>

37
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,490
lower speed interface that's

38
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,409
transitioning to a higher speed

39
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,750
technology so the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing applies</font>

40
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,079
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one gig to 10 gig and 10 gig</font>

41
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,039
200 gig things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but basically</font>

42
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,658
I've been in a lot of meetings with

43
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:32,399
customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have literally come</font>

44
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,170
out of the woodwork interested in a

45
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,090
hundred gig so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

46
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,340
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe we don't think</font>

47
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">about traditionally in a in an ISP or</font>

48
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,170
service spider<font color="#E5E5E5"> network basically from</font>

49
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,310
the court the edge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metro a lot of</font>

50
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,979
interest from high performance computing

51
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,100
folks that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to build these</font>

52
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:52,320
cloths interconnects that provide the

53
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,689
same bandwidth to each end station over

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,689
a cluster and then also obviously in

55
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,820
data center applications to basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

56
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,648
think legs done done a really good job

57
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,990
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in terms of solving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems but</font>

58
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,850
it only goes so far and there are a

59
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,589
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues with leg and ecmp and</font>

60
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,630
then the side effects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I like to</font>

61
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,650
remind people are that as we move to a

62
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,329
denser new tech

63
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,220
the lower speed technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

64
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,020
become even more dense right so if we

65
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,600
have a hunter gig interface that's at

66
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:25,610
least a 10 by 10 gig interface on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

67
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:28,700
same card if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity is there so</font>

68
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,260
basically like I said lag and ecmp have

69
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,450
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

70
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,429
solution for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people but it</font>

71
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,530
doesn't solve every problem we have a

72
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,120
lot of scalability issues in terms of

73
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,700
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of legs and then the number</font>

74
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of links</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a leg so in terms of</font>

75
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,649
scaling up the number of links and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a leg</font>

76
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,510
you have to resources run lacp now we

77
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,920
see requirements for example in large

78
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,709
data centers where they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> duel</font>

79
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,380
home servers so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people asking us</font>

80
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">for for several thousand lacp sessions</font>

81
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,269
so that can get kind of taxing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

82
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,489
cpu and then as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you scale up also the</font>

83
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,590
number of links in the legs<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hashing</font>

84
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,120
becomes extremely complex so you have to

85
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,950
do a really good job of obviously

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,780
distributing that data over each link my

87
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,320
leg or else you get a lot of lumpiness

88
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,210
and then the other problem really is

89
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,630
that hashing is decoupled from link

90
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,950
capacity so there's only one proprietary

91
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,710
vendor implementation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know of</font>

92
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,149
that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pays attention to how much</font>

93
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,240
capacity is on the link but basically

94
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,500
the hashing algorithm can't tell and or

95
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,600
the link can't tell the hashing

96
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,910
algorithm when it's full so the hashing

97
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,910
algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically hashes as fast as a</font>

98
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,560
can and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sprays packets over the</font>

99
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,620
number of links in the leg and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if</font>

100
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,510
it's full then there's packet loss

101
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,790
there's a couple problems with flows I

102
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,370
think one of them we won't where I'm

103
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,510
going to see there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole problem</font>

104
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,800
where people are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about where</font>

105
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to have 10 gig flows I</font>

106
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,070
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen anyone putting out 10 gig</font>

107
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,540
flows today that will probably happen in

108
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,579
the future but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the problem that</font>

109
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do have right now is that there are</font>

110
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,590
lots of large flows that could exceed

111
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,600
the capacity of a link so I know that

112
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,910
people are sending out for example gig

113
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,460
flows and if the hashing so if you have

114
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,590
a if you your internet backbone provider

115
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,960
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably have a very</font>

116
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,610
diverse number of inputs and outputs<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

117
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,350
your hashing function and you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

118
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,299
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different packet sizes so if the</font>

119
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,269
hashing is a little bit lumpy it's

120
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably not</font>

121
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,509
the world but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have gig flows that</font>

122
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,490
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hash on to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

123
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,710
giggling for example and the hashing

124
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,770
breaks then that can really go wrong and

125
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,109
overflow the links in terms of hashing

126
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,060
problems there been some implementations

127
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,740
that had problems with odd links where

128
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,060
the hashing would turn out very lumpy so

129
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,039
that's kind of a hard problem solved

130
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,110
sometimes the hashing algorithms are too

131
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple and allow that the top of racks</font>

132
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,639
which is for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the asics just use</font>

133
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:46,770
a subset of the bits in the source and

134
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,840
destination IP addresses reports or

135
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,299
something and then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can turn out</font>

136
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,250
badly if there's no variation and then

137
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,259
also hashing algorithms are typically

138
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,960
limited and how deep they look into a

139
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,000
packet so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> many just work on</font>

140
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,799
the top source and destination headers

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,020
and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually look into deeper</font>

142
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,150
feels like mpls labels or VPNs or things

143
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,318
like that them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font>

144
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,810
the day even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

145
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,669
hashing algorithm if you don't have any

146
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,650
diversity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the input</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the hashing</font>

147
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:18,659
function then outputs not going to be

148
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:21,840
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> diverse either so as far as the</font>

149
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:24,180
technology update we've had a lot of

150
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,479
first-generation things on the market so

151
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,409
everything from test test equipment to

152
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,389
optical gear routers and switches

153
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,520
started shipping last year when this

154
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,380
janet was done so we also have a lot of

155
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,258
second generation projects now that are

156
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,389
based on four times 25 gigs<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling so</font>

157
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,909
the first generation is usually based on

158
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,250
10 by 10 so 10 lanes of 10 gig either

159
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:46,800
electrical or optical there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

160
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,690
new developments that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which</font>

161
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,310
are in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Triple E one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

162
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,990
copper study group was started in

163
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,580
November I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see a whole lot of</font>

164
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest in copper cables and back</font>

165
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">planes but apparently there is interest</font>

166
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,919
in the I Triple E from some of the

167
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,029
participants so I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that</font>

168
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,979
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the operator</font>

169
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,710
community probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more for the server</font>

170
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,240
and people trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build blade servers</font>

171
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,789
and things like that using<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-capacity</font>

172
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,039
back points now they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

173
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:13,620
thing that's going on that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

174
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,090
developed in the last year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

175
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,090
couple months is something called a

176
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten-by-ten MSA so an MSA stands for</font>

177
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,239
multi-source agreement it's basically a

178
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,190
bunch of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting together saying</font>

179
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,780
hey here's a standard we're going to

180
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">build the standard and we</font>

181
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,659
going to make equipment that supports

182
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> standard so there are lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

183
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,330
examples of MSA 80 kilometer and 100

184
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,250
kilometer long haul optics there's no I

185
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">Triple E standard but it's an MSA</font>

186
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,650
standard and it works for example the

187
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,050
goal of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this MSA is really to deliver a</font>

188
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,609
much lower cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 gig optic the</font>

189
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,850
standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were finding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I Tripoli</font>

190
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,980
were chosen at the time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the most</font>

191
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost-effective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out that that</font>

192
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,060
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> was was incorrect in there's a</font>

193
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,469
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> way in a cheaper way of doing</font>

194
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,160
things so what's happened really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

195
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,750
there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of not only optics</font>

196
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,190
and equipment vendor support but there

197
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,230
has been an exceptional amount of

198
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,600
network operators that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> joined this</font>

199
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:09,630
MSA and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are very vocal Google in</font>

200
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,270
particular has been a big supporter and

201
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,169
driver of this MSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> and facebook also</font>

202
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,940
just joined officially last<font color="#E5E5E5"> week so it's</font>

203
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,859
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see network operators</font>

204
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,250
actually getting involved very early on

205
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,650
in what's going on with with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> optics</font>

206
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,870
and trying to push<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to deliver things</font>

207
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,130
that better meet the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the costs and</font>

208
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,370
distance requirements and that's really

209
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here in the I Triple E is also</font>

210
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start on a couple of new</font>

211
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,820
projects probably the summer in July

212
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,250
that will define the<font color="#CCCCCC"> second generation</font>

213
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the official i triple e standards so</font>

214
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,860
again that's based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> four times 25 big</font>

215
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:49,080
signaling so next up is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible</font>

216
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,610
slide that I have to show and I keep

217
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,680
updating it and it gets denser and

218
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,390
denser and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> only can't read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

219
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,760
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back but really this is</font>

220
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,010
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reference slide to take away so</font>

221
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,719
when anyone's talking about stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

222
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,190
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the hunter gig your pass</font>

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,680
or coming in a future think of this

224
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> color so</font>

225
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,150
I kind of divided it into current I

226
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,979
Triple E standards huge ride for police

227
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,989
standards and then the MSA standards

228
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,280
that are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on today so again</font>

229
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,650
think of this as kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference on</font>

230
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,080
a road map I was going to try something

231
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,760
interesting maybe if you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up tonight</font>

232
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,370
to the social and you can ask me a

233
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,500
question that is on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I</font>

234
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,750
will get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a free beer so maybe that</font>

235
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,409
will entice people to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember the</font>

236
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:36,879
slides

237
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:40,328
and so the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted me is</font>

238
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:46,500
there a limit why I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not paying for the</font>

239
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:48,670
social so no there is no limit so the

240
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,300
see the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that I want to make</font>

241
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:54,550
which I've totally forgotten oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes</font>

242
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,439
in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> road map so like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I saying</font>

243
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,240
before there's a bunch of technologies

244
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:00,310
on the market today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then future</font>

245
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,860
technology so the the real second

246
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,829
generation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli standards really</font>

247
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,689
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out in 2013 so what we</font>

248
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,099
have on the market right now is what

249
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:10,660
we'll see from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next couple years and</font>

250
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,430
then we'll have the second generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

251
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology so just like 10 gig remember</font>

252
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,709
we start out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 30 pin 300 pen MSA</font>

253
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,839
which was the big laser with the fiber

254
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,329
jump cables for 10 gig right now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

255
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,519
sfp+ so we'll see the same thing happen

256
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:27,060
with the hunter gig over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next couple</font>

257
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,709
years and as we develop new technology

258
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,719
all right so enough on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide this</font>

259
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:33,670
is the slide that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more</font>

260
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,189
detail about what optics are actually

261
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,529
available on the market today now the

262
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:40,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing is the pricing and</font>

263
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,889
this goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what the 10 by 10 MSA</font>

264
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,889
is trying to accomplish with lower

265
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:47,019
pricing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used our are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brocade</font>

266
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:49,420
list pricing and abstract<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that into</font>

267
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,750
just a dollar figure so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

268
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:55,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wealthy of the very end the</font>

269
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">10-kilometer single-mode lr4 optic</font>

270
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,310
that's the I Triple E standard it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

271
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,139
expensive because it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very complex</font>

272
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,689
component and has a lot of circuitry

273
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:07,660
inside that does conversion between 10

274
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:10,449
gig to 25 gig and things like that the

275
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,600
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometre MSA is really targeted to</font>

276
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:16,089
be about half the price of the

<font color="#CCCCCC">10-kilometer i triple e lr for so that's</font>

278
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">really where the network operators have</font>

279
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,160
come forward and said we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">kilometers we actually just need about</font>

do it and we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford to pay 150</font>

283
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,540
thousand dollars for an optic it's just

284
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,500
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive it's not going to work out</font>

285
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,500
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing that I like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font>

286
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the media type so a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people ask</font>

287
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,450
me you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> joiny WDM infrastructure for</font>

288
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 kilometers or the</font>

289
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,160
two kilometer<font color="#CCCCCC"> no doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just runs on a</font>

290
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:47,680
pair of single-mode fiber and it does

291
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,939
actually the WDM functions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the optics</font>

292
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,620
so that's another reason why they're so

293
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,740
expensive is because like I said they

294
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">are quite complex all right in terms of</font>

295
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,460
the router market<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just made a very</font>

296
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple slide saying you know these are</font>

297
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the router vendors that have equipment</font>

298
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,740
available that you can buy right now

299
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,870
this is the feature set that they

300
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,750
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is the optics that they</font>

301
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,220
support so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in a</font>

302
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,440
hundred gig I would encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

303
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,180
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these vendors and ask them what</font>

304
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,430
their plans are and more importantly

305
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,199
tell them what your needs are because I

306
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,209
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's still you know a little</font>

307
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,160
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a disconnect as to what's coming</font>

308
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,080
out on the market right now and what

309
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,939
customers actually need so that's again

310
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,100
why I'm excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this MSA because</font>

311
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,450
the network operators are so vocal and

312
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,730
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requirements and are</font>

313
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pushing the vendors to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deliver</font>

314
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok in terms of optical</font>

315
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,750
transport network some of you have seen

316
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,819
this slide before and I keep saying I'm

317
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,650
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optical experts oh my my own</font>

318
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,800
knowledge is somewhat<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited here but</font>

319
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:47,230
basically in the next couple years will

320
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,209
see two new tears for optical transport

321
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,340
come out I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll see anyone</font>

322
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,470
making 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gig ways available on the</font>

323
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,020
market today a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back end</font>

324
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,880
actually uses some hunter gig component

325
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,880
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front end and then the alco</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pier</font>

326
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,130
uses 10 by 10 or some other some of

327
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,600
their aggregation technology to manage

328
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,240
the waves on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back end but eventually</font>

329
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,640
in a couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever we have</font>

330
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,290
actually owe to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ways on the</font>

331
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,240
market you will eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

332
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,980
buy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a transport that runs out</font>

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,360
100 gig from from wherever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

334
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,710
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then that kind of wraps up where</font>

335
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,630
we're going with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what's</font>

336
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,160
new so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to turn over to Brent to</font>

337
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,240
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some of them are thinking in</font>

338
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,240
their thoughts<font color="#CCCCCC"> on operations</font>

339
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,459
first time eminence

340
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,180
okay so hey i'm brett van<font color="#CCCCCC"> gieson just</font>

341
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,290
started with limelight a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

342
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:13,680
working the network architecture team

343
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:16,510
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Denver Maddux Tom coughing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got all</font>

344
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,160
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic motivational drivers</font>

345
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,199
the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of want to</font>

346
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about was the steady increase in</font>

347
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,069
hardware and software performance on our

348
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,360
server platforms over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last several</font>

349
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,709
years and it's to the point now where

350
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago probably when I</font>

351
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:34,209
started an interface wouldn't exceed you

352
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:38,110
know a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred megabytes or so</font>

353
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:39,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">without the cpes being floored so we're</font>

354
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,339
to the point now<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years later where</font>

355
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,570
we're filling<font color="#E5E5E5"> up multiple one gig bonded</font>

356
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:47,320
ports and we're actually starting to

357
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,720
install 10 gigabit connected servers we

358
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,519
haven't quite seen a full you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

359
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,949
capacity on those 10 gig connected

360
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,449
servers at this time but it's it's

361
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:57,339
thrown some challenges in there with

362
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:58,569
some of the flow based<font color="#E5E5E5"> caching that we</font>

363
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,970
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they Greg talked</font>

364
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:04,000
about earlier where we've got servers

365
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,550
that are sending enormous blows one

366
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,250
particular destination you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

367
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:12,180
in flow so basically we end up with the

368
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:16,510
lumpy flag<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing where we've got</font>

369
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,069
multiple you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh 20 port lag with 10</font>

370
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,019
gig ports in there and maybe one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

371
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:21,610
those ports will go up gigabit or two

372
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,829
higher than the other ones when we've

373
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:28,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">got these extremely large flows being</font>

374
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:31,380
sent between servers so and then you

375
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:35,380
know another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is just the village I</font>

376
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,000
don't know operational installation and

377
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,670
maintenance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that bandwidth that's</font>

378
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">installed using 10 gig interfaces versus</font>

379
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:45,790
go into something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a hundred gig so</font>

380
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,199
we basically just came<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this rule of</font>

381
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">thumb</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're running</font>

382
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">with servers that are at the same speed</font>

383
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,399
as your core interface you know fastest

384
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,450
technology then you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

385
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,310
running into these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

386
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,980
any problems I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font>

387
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably don't use per packet hashing as</font>

388
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,490
much i'm sure you've run into the same

389
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,530
packet ordering problems that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

390
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,630
and you know flow base seems to be kind

391
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:11,199
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody is really</font>

392
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:14,140
going with so the technical

393
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,150
considerations really the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

394
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is just this mpo fiber for the</font>

395
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,590
short range and the fact that it's

396
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,420
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not built out in most of the</font>

397
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,040
facilities as far as cross connects ago

398
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,990
so it kind of limits the

399
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,150
interconnections that we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

400
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,250
devices that are in the same cage or in

401
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,600
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> location where it's easy to</font>

402
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:36,010
install and manage of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpo fibers</font>

403
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,240
connecting to other providers is going

404
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,460
to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> different because we're</font>

405
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,560
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially</font>

406
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,450
issues with cross connects not being

407
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,939
installed and you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

408
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,790
through hoops to build an NPO to you

409
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,800
know break out<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber kind of patch cable</font>

410
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,510
where you could use ten cross connects

411
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually connect to devices together</font>

412
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:59,920
over a patch panel but like it's you

413
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:04,900
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of complicated so next slide</font>

414
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,550
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so significant man-hours save we're</font>

415
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,260
definitely talking about you know if

416
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,270
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got one guy installing one fiber</font>

417
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,740
every day and he's got to turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

418
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,600
fiber up and he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

419
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,550
that's cleaned and the light levels are

420
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,740
good and the traffic passes over the

421
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,689
interface you know without any problems

422
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,730
and that kind of thing so we start

423
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,890
turning up you know ten of these a week

424
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:27,100
starts to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a burden on the</font>

425
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:30,670
installation provisioning staff so you

426
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,080
know one of the big you know benefits is

427
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,520
basically being able to turn up<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

428
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:40,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">times as much bandwidth with one time</font>

429
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:45,730

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:47,620
installing me fibers and stuff cross

431
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,540
connects we're definitely going to be

432
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,730
saving money with cross connects right

433
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,860
now we've probably got you know hundreds

434
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,389
if not a thousand or so cross connects

435
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">and use everywhere and if you started</font>

436
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,009
talking about few<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred dollars across</font>

437
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect times you know a year's worth of</font>

438
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,740
monthly recurring charges you're talking

439
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:04,409
about hundreds of thousands of dollars

440
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cross connects that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font>

441

maintain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and continue to pay for so</font>

442
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,609
obviously there's a benefit to going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

443
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,959
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a more dense media format</font>

444
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:20,168
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can save on his cross connect</font>

445
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:23,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs router density is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that</font>

446
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:26,620
we've been looking at it's easier to fit

447
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,200
100 gig with one port on a on a slot

448
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">than to try and have 10 10 gig ports so</font>

449
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,090
we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of increase in</font>

450
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,199
density up to twenty percent or so

451
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,780
immediately and that doesn't you know

452
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,970
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> include future upgrades to</font>

453
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,860
the router platform switch fabrics and

454
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,130
whatnot it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually lead to</font>

455
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,658
greater 100 gig densities and whatnot so

456
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,570
definitely going to increase the life of

457
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:52,210
the platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you know a little</font>

458
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,710
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> about lag membership we've we've run</font>

459
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,020
up against<font color="#E5E5E5"> limits where you know we can</font>

460
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,610
only have 32 members and a lag and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

461
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to upgrade code to support a</font>

462
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,139
greater number of lag limits and so

463
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something that we've run into and</font>

464
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,480
you know have needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade software</font>

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,000
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future 100 gig I'm sure there's</font>

466
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a hundred gig limit but I</font>

467
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,600
don't anticipate running into those as

468
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,240
quickly especially if we can make sure

469
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendors can kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

470
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,690
foresee that they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have legs</font>

471
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,510
so it's not like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

472
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,890
completely get rid of a lag but you know

473
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,110
the membership will be reduced down to

474
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,390
maybe four members in the lag or or

475
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,678
maybe eight and then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

476
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,330
pretty much out of slots in your router

477
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,330
to hook anymore up so

478
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,440
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk a little bit about</font>

479
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,029
kind of where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need 100 gig the first</font>

480
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,740
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just to make sure everybody is</font>

481
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:43,940
aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're content delivery</font>

482
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,820
network and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have the</font>

483
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,889
same requirements as far as capacity is

484
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,590
like a typical carrier so the greatest

485
00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">density of our interconnections are</font>

486
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:57,168
going to be from servers in a particular

487
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">region to the users that are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

488
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,070
region so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a very dense</font>

489
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,168
network within each individual region

490
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,850
that we have a presence so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest</font>

491
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the connectivity</font>

492
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,168
from the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to aggregation switches</font>

493
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">then aggregation switches through the</font>

494
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:12,769
optical<font color="#CCCCCC"> metro gear that we use to</font>

495
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,230
interconnect facilities in a region and

496
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:17,059
then up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual routing platform</font>

497
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,600
or we've got to build a very dense

498
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:22,460
router core match to basically have

499
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,269
capacity to all of our egress points

500
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,429
that are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that region the next biggest</font>

501
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,840
thing is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be with the egress the</font>

502
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:32,690
actual egress there's going to be five

503
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">or six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our top egress providers that</font>

504
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,600
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

505
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,850
turning up under gig with just because

506
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,918
of the overall management that we talked

507
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,899
about earlier with dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

508
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,250
immuno the number of 10 gigs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

509
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:46,158
turning up certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers and</font>

510
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:50,750
basically being able to cut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

511
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:52,730
overhead by going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a faster standard</font>

512
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:56,120
so that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be your peering</font>

513
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,940
exchanges and then the larger hearing

514
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,279
and transit tie providers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

515
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">last thing is going to be the backbone</font>

516
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:06,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backbone to us is is very important</font>

517
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">to our business but it's not a core</font>

518
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,449
business product that we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell</font>

519
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:12,709
you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not selling transit to</font>

520
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,860
use up our back about as much it's just

521
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:19,309
there to deliver content from origin

522
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,539
servers basically so the the need is

523
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,980
there i mean we're definitely at

524
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:24,320
multiple 10 gigs but we're not at

525
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,990
multiple tens of 10 gigs like we are

526
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,659
within a particular region so

527
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,240
the main driver is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you know</font>

528
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,190
inter connecting facilities in a

529
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,460
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> region where we can have lots</font>

530
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,050
of cheap space to put servers

531
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:46,070
interconnecting into the more expensive

532
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:46,070
kind of more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network rich facilities</font>

533
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:54,539
and so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really exciting thing</font>

534
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,120
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me as the optical gear that's the</font>

535
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,820
thing if you touch it right there the

536
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,918
optical gears I'm really fired up about

537
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,879
this because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know right now</font>

538
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're using the the nortel Sienna</font>

539
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,400
filters<font color="#CCCCCC"> their 88 channels and 50</font>

540
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,200
gigahertz spacing and I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> blown</font>

541
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,690
away by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hunter gig</font>

542
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,750
optical here that's out now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

543
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:21,630
capable of cramming 100 gigs into the

544
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,370
same 50 gigahertz spacing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're</font>

545
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,890
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at now is an increase of our</font>

546
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:29,850
optical<font color="#E5E5E5"> metro capacity on a single dark</font>

547
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:32,730
fiber pair from 880 gigs to 8.8 terabits

548
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:35,428
so that really you know cuts down on the

549
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,929
amount of dark<font color="#CCCCCC"> fire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean turning up</font>

550
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,940
fiber to other providers is one thing

551
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:41,100
but turning up dark fiber between

552
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,289
facilities is a whole nother ball game

553
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:48,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> requires a lot more work and a lot</font>

554
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:49,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">more you know basically cleaning fibers</font>

555
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,120
this that mailer making sure that

556
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,649
basically all the optical power levels

557
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,620
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay over that fiber and</font>

558
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:57,750
that there's not going to be too much

559
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:01,199
version or chromatic aberration or any

560
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,909
of that stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all this hundred</font>

561
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,409
all this hundred gig optical gear right

562
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:07,169
now is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to be used over</font>

563
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same fiber there's not going to be</font>

564
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,950
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new fiber standard that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

565
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,380
required most<font color="#CCCCCC"> fly where that's been</font>

566
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:16,830
installed for the last 20 years maybe

567
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:20,190
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> 28 maybe 15 and 10 is capable of</font>

568
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:23,460
supporting 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gigs so the density</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

569
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,390
little bit less on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the optical here just</font>

570
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,940
because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> immense amount of</font>

571
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,870
technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes into you know</font>

572
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,340
multiplexing you know all these all

573
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,229
these hundred gigs or gets basically

574
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,809
into one device so we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

575
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:40,529
maybe some decrease in shelf capacity

576
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:42,658
overall with what's available now my

577
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,020
vendors are telling me that by you know

578
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,840
them

579
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,420
the year late this year we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

580
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">second generation third generation</font>

581
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,750
product it'll it'll kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that</font>

582
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:57,060
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> down in line with with what we have</font>

583
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:58,620
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really all had to talk about I</font>

584
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,480
guess as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operational stuff</font>

585
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,969
we're not really using 108 today but we

586
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,700
really have a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it based on the I</font>

587
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:08,370
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tens of hundred gig lags that we</font>

588
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,970
built you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've got several hundred</font>

589
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:14,129
gigs coming from a server platform to

590
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,840
routing platform in another facility so

591
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,190
that just starts to become a huge

592
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,189
nightmare with just dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

593
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and this whole hundred gig</font>

594
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,240
thing would really make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that easier for</font>

595
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,590
us as soon as the cost gets in line with

596
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,220
kind of what we're spending now and

597
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:34,550
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> tanguay ports and that's pretty</font>

598
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,550
much all I have questions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg night</font>

599
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have one if nobody else has one um</font>

600
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,820
this is kind of a futures question maybe

601
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,020
for Greg um so given<font color="#E5E5E5"> how long has it</font>

602
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,840
been since we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on a</font>

603
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:55,240
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig starting 2005 okay so uh</font>

604
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:59,310
yeah six years six years okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we</font>

605
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:03,040
worked it out um sort of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> trail man</font>

606
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,120
BAM stamina um so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking data</font>

607
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,520
center like the really mess with

608
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,770
scalable ones right now if the if people

609
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,080
build a service additional hierarchical

610
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,310
architecture so you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> top-of-rack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

611
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,990
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of aggregation device</font>

612
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,730
then you have some router if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look on</font>

613
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,650
those links between the aggregation

614
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:20,380
device in the router sometimes over to

615
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,150
subscribe by on the order of 240 or

616
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,160
something to one in the large data

617
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,680
centers given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the uplinks are</font>

618
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,090
already 10 gigs<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't leave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

619
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,750
lot of headroom if you have a hundred

620
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">year so what what is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take us</font>

621
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,200
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to whatever's</font>

622
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,650
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer gig because it seems like</font>

623
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,810
there's already kind of demand 400g yeah

624
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:43,150
so one of the questions that came up is

625
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:45,639
why we're starting another gig so late

626
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,430
and why it took so long so as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

627
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,710
what's going on the future um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

628
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,960
the idea so kind of packable but the I

629
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,390
Triple E was hesitant to start a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

630
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,430
project in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular because of the way</font>

631
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,740
that 10 gig market played out and the

632
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,570
fact that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people put companies</font>

633
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,920
into 10 gig and then those companies

634
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,750
went under because there wasn't the

635
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,270
demand and its really 10 gig really<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

636
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,650
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been driven by the server edge and</font>

637
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,560
that's what's driving a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

638
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:13,780
market growth and 10 gigs so now the I

639
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,970
Triple E I think understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

640
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,889
internet and understands the traffic

641
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,780
demands in the growth pattern took a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

642
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,460
of education<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the I Triple</font>

643
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:25,120
E when they're basically made up<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

644
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,740
component vendors and circuit benders

645
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,989
and optics vendors and things like that

646
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they they don't get how the</font>

647
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,580
internet works so actually Ted was there

648
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,590
quite a bit Jason Wilde<font color="#E5E5E5"> from cox was</font>

649
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,510
there Peter from NTT was there so we did

650
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,919
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Education and Hank from amex</font>

651
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,510
was also their kind of explaining this

652
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,040
is how the internet works and you know

653
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is internet exchange and this is</font>

654
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,060
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sprint's network that carries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

655
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,870
don't know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of passing this is why</font>

656
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,929
we need 200 gigs

657
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:52,840
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the future I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the next</font>

658
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:55,780
generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> will come faster hopefully a</font>

659
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:58,449
project being started and maybe in the

660
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,340
next couple of years the likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed</font>

661
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,830
that's being talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is 400 gig</font>

662
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,570
just because it was really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

663
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,970
from 10 gig to 100 gig in terms of

664
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,919
Technology and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see a lot of the</font>

665
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:12,130
first generation stuff is still based on

666
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,380
10 by 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> gigs so as far as a future 400</font>

667
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,870
gigs seems a likely choice based on

668
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,640
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with internal components</font>

669
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">in internal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling within routers</font>

670
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,000
going to from 10 gig to 25 gig so it

671
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,770
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be possible to aggregate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1625</font>

672
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,840
extremes into a foreigner gig Ethernet

673
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,250
that's what people are talking about for

674
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the future and you know I definitely</font>

675
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,210
agree it needs to come faster and we

676
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,240
kind of surpassed the need<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hundred</font>

677
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:39,520
guild already except the market is kind

678
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:46,690
of lagging behind so what definitely

679
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:49,480
agree hey Greg oh thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

680
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:55,710
shoutout for being there yeah four years

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not against the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tip I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can have a say</font>

683
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:01,750
thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

684
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:05,740
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it was a mistake well agree</font>

685
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:07,090
about five years ago that the packaging

686
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:11,610
wasn't there to do at the time it

687
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:15,639
announced there but MSA does not imply i

688
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:17,590
triple e compliance down the road mean

689
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be there so people do more than</font>

690
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,280
just because it's cheap and says a

691
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,780
hundred gig doesn't mean it will always

692
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,250
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you wanted to with your</font>

693
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,410
other thing that is either to about

694
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:30,520
three that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's six so damn long</font>

695
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:33,429
do anything with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those guys yep I think</font>

696
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,440
that's a good point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point I also</font>

697
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:38,559
like to make is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the I Triple E</font>

698
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,059
likes to define ethernet interface and

699
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,629
speed standards and they don't

700
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily have to define every when I</font>

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,800
say interface I mean interface between

702
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,480
Max and thighs and things like that not

703
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,980
physical interface the I Triple E

704
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,920
doesn't need to define every physical

705
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,940
interface speed that is out there just

706
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,860
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a nitrile police</font>

707
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,530
standard doesn't mean that it won't

708
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,840
interoperate but yeah to your point Ted

709
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,490
I

710
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,029
um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're right and definitely</font>

711
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:07,100
you know well there are no cheap you

712
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:08,419
know Chinese optics right now but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

713
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,760
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you pay for right</font>

714
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:13,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually i'm sure there will be cheap</font>

715
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:16,610
cheap optics undergear optics from Asia

716
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,620
but in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of standards compliance the</font>

717
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">MSA is a standard so if you buy</font>

718
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,820
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is 10 x 10 ms a compliant</font>

719
00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:31,909
then there's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

720
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:35,570
interoperate I can feel normal to me is

721
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:37,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm not sure who to address this to</font>

722
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,350
break I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might know the answers</font>

723
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:42,379
but probably are<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be easy you can</font>

724
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:44,990
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it maybe both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are you</font>

725
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,169
talked about ever talk about the skin

726
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:50,500
ability of the shells I see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

727
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:53,299
serious issue getting more<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gig</font>

728
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,070
interfaces in a given amount of real

estate<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some expensive high rent</font>

730
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:01,279
datacenter you have any feel for how

731
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:04,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">long it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be obviously it's</font>

732
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,940
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take you for dr office to get</font>

733
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:12,649
scales up to say in your 10-under gig

734
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:14,450
ports on a single blade do you think

735
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:17,029
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> even gonna be in the foreseeable</font>

736
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,470
future definitely that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're</font>

737
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:20,210
trying to go and kind of answer your

738
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,340
question there's a couple new form

739
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:25,429
factors that are under consideration

740
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:29,240
called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFP two and then the CFP for</font>

741
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:32,840
and qsfp<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so these are all smaller</font>

742
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,960
and smaller form factor hopefully less

743
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,539
power media that we eventually allow us

744
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,919
to get to you know eight ports on a

745
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:42,080
blade or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that and if you</font>

746
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,220
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a CFP optic kind of the</font>

747
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kevins point you know they're about</font>

748
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,440
their larger than your iPhone so you

749
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,929
know it's a very wide media and we only

750
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,179
have 19 inches of bored real estate well

751
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:54,679
a little bit less right so we can only

752
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:57,049
fit so much stuff on the front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

753
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,299
board so we do need smaller optics and

754
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:00,500
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a big consideration</font>

755
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:02,840
but you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said with 10 gig</font>

756
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,940
first we have the 300 pmsa you know now

757
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,970
we have sfp+ so that's a pretty

758
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:10,280
significant size reduction in terms of

759
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,100
form factor real estate but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

760
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,500
and power

761
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">consumption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so all that stuff is a big</font>

762
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,010
consideration you know it's like

763
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:20,039
anything and you have a cheap fast and

764
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:22,559
easy pick any two right so that's kind

765
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:24,360
of where we are right now but yeah so

766
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,530
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I point out that these two</font>

767
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,969
new projects are starting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I</font>

768
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,350
Triple E is because we're already

769
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,660
starting to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only the</font>

770
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">next generation of Hunter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gig signaling</font>

771
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,190
and interfaces but also the counterpart

772
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:41,879
which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know the optics and</font>

773
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:44,370
what that looks like your future the

774
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">pickety</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cheap is not going to be one</font>

775
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:57,178
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones you're gonna get pic</font>

776
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:59,809
hopefully cheaper anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else alright</font>

777
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:59,809
thanks guys
