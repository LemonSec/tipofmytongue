00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,549
feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact us if you need</font>

149
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:48,090
additional details or information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

150
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:51,240
them so thank you very much any question

151
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,239
thank you

152
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,530
thanks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot that sounds real</font>

153
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,260
interesting if you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> business in</font>

154
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:10,789
the black Nick region Argentina Chile in

155
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:10,789
October she's over number two

156
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,919
just

157
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,100
hi I'm manish from the research group at

158
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Merrit and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to talk about</font>

159
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,870
today very briefly is some traffic

160
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,000
analysis we've done on recently

161
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,150
allocated well recently as of three

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,450
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago allocated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> /e blocks in</font>

163
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,800
particular here's the framework that we

164
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,020
use for a darknet collection and

165
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,329
analysis so what we do is we work with

166
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,250
the rirs go ahead and get their

167
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,310
permission to advertise and collect this

168
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,350
data and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tail end of it what</font>

169
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,359
our purpose is to make this data

170
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,490
available to the research community but

171
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,440
for the rirs in particular what we want

172
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,840
to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> make recommendations on what</font>

173
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,060
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do to watch out for potential</font>

174
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,710
hot spot activity that or areas of the

175
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,400
address space that that they should stay

176
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,190
away from are not allocate to customers

177
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,090
so roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> our goal is analyzed the data</font>

178
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,920
determine how much and what kinds of

179
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,200
pollution<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is and whether there's</font>

180
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,360
hope for cleanup or simply to quarantine

181
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,210
those those blocks and not not hand them

182
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,410
out in this particular study and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

183
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,240
calling this part<font color="#CCCCCC"> two because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done</font>

184
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of these earlier on a different set</font>

185
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,360
of blocks we were looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> six / aids</font>

186
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,189
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected several data sets the</font>

187
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,670
data set that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be just describing</font>

188
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,710
the analysis on today consists of one

189
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,839
set of 3 / aids which were announced

190
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,220
simultaneously and then the other three

191
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,590
were announced at different different

192
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time frames there's another data</font>

193
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,510
set that was collected<font color="#CCCCCC"> 47 contiguous</font>

194
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,040
days of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 /a announcements so if you</font>

195
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,450

197
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:02,240

198
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,830
announcements suddenly appear so here's

199
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,570
here's a comparison of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic</font>

200
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:09,560
volumes that we're seeing in these /

201
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,280
aids the 37 the 45 and 100 on top were

202
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,290
the ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were announced</font>

203
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,900
simultaneously and what is really cool

204
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,310
about about the analysis of about this

205
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,860
data this time is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

206
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,660
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see simultaneous activity in all</font>

207
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,520
three blocks and those spikes that

208
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,199
you're seeing there were essentially we

209
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyzed them a little bit more dug in</font>

210
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,920
and those were backscatter from what we

211
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,529
think is

212
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">denial-of-service attacks for the DNS</font>

213
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,380
servers we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to confirm some of</font>

214
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,490
this with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks at verisign</font>

215
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,130
the bottom three graphs are the ones

216
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the disjoint announcements and</font>

217
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,310
what you're seeing there across most of

218
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,389
them is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic ones are fairly</font>

219
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:50,399
consistent except for the 5 / 8 now the

220
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:55,800
5 / it was a surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us in this</font>

221
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,630
whole study the 5 / 8 is almost or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

222
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,260
it's much more polluted than than

223
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,360
anything else we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as as long</font>

224
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">as you don't include</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the one /a your</font>

225
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">scene speaks up as much as 250 megabits</font>

226
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,510
per second of traffic and most of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

227
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,120
it turns out is headed towards you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

228
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,680
easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> memorized about human human</font>

229
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,130
understandable<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses like five dot</font>

230
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,839
five dot 505 and large<font color="#E5E5E5"> bursts of UDP</font>

231
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,329
streams essentially targeted for those

232
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,269
addresses another surprise in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this study</font>

233
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:26,609
for us was the 45<font color="#E5E5E5"> / 8 now this one is</font>

234
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:29,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually reclaim space and reallocated</font>

235
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,290
we expected to see all sites all sorts

236
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,699
of stuff in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we found exactly</font>

237
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,760
the opposite it was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cleaner</font>

238
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:38,010
blocks so this was a very surprising

239
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,459
thing because 45 / 8 has been the

240
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,569
interop address space and to see it

241
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:45,000
surprisingly clean was was very

242
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,589
interesting so let's dig in a little bit

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,060
more our purpose<font color="#CCCCCC"> here once again was to</font>

244
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:51,060
find hot spots and figure out what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

245
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,949
can do to contain the damage the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot</font>

246
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">spot these graphs are the six graphs</font>

247
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:59,790
comparing the CDF function of the

248
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">destination / 24 address space so if you</font>

249
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,880
see a straight line what that means as

250
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:04,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address is uniformly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> distributed</font>

251
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,620
across the entire space there are no hot

252
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,510
spots if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see a curve it means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

253
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,660
the there's very strong hot spot

254
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,310
activity that means a few of the / 24 s

255
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,100
are accounting for larger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

256
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,349
fair share of traffic as you can see the

257
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,839
45 and the in the 105 right in the

258
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,190
middle are relatively flat the only

259
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,649
thing you see is the kink in the middle

260
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,930
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kink me know what would the</font>

261
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">cause for that is that's basically the</font>

262
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:33,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">caused by the configure there's a bias</font>

263
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,089
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way configure worm targets or</font>

264
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,519
scans for other potential targets so we

265
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,260
know that kink and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you though if you</font>

266
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,600
take the factor out that kink the

267
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,360
traffic is relatively uniformly district

268
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,100
across those blocks the<font color="#CCCCCC"> five slash it on</font>

269
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,769
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand you see very strong curve</font>

270
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,759
very strong hot spotting 23 / 8 the same

271
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:55,920
thing and 37 / 800 / e as well once

272
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,839
again in 100 / 8<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's human human</font>

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">memorize herbal addresses we see a lot</font>

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">of packets going to 100 100 100 100 but</font>

275
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,839
let's do some interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> case studies</font>

276
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,220
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly so in the 37</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> /a this was</font>

277
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,720
very interesting now here you would

278
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,880
think it's not one of those easy ones

279
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,410
it's not one<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one that one so</font>

280
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,300
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you see such strong hotspot of</font>

281
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:19,649
activity so you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at two graphs</font>

282
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:22,500
here one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 destinations / 16</font>

283
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:25,579
destinations within the 37<font color="#CCCCCC"> / a and the</font>

284
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,620
graph on the right is what / 24 s and

285
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:29,910
what you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only is a single / 16</font>

286
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,540
accounting for the bulk of the traffic

287
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,949
but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single / 24 within that 16</font>

288
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,430
that's accounting for most of this

289
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:40,800
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we dug in a little bit more</font>

290
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,920
this is the distribution by port of how

291
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,209
much traffic we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying destination</font>

292
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,899
port port 80 was very prominent in this

293
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:54,329
traffic and what we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was when we</font>

294
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,160
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so we when we analyze a</font>

295
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,258
traffic by hand we found all of it was

296
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,130
going to a single IP address and that IP

297
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:04,920
address as it as it as we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out was</font>

298
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:07,350
quoted in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blog entry as being one of</font>

300

responses for blocking our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

301
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,329
that's the so a single IP address is

302
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,619
causing this enormous spike in traffic

303
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:21,630
for unused address space the 23 / 8 once

304
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,139
again we see very strong hot spot

305
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:28,230
activity if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this / 24</font>

306
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,000
distribution a single / 24 is accounting

307
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,769
for most of the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we</font>

308
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
slice it more once again it's a single

309
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:36,060
IP address that's accounting for most of

310
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,149
the traffic the UDP destination port for

311
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,638
that traffic is 3100 source port 21 09

312
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:45,060
it's a single UDP stream well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

313
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,589
as it turns out we took all that scream

314
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,029
out you know try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extract something</font>

315

out of it and turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to be a video</font>

322

really weird it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a you know</font>

323
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,250
copyrighted video so i probably

324
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,180
shouldn't play too much of it

325
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:13,160
essentially movie streams from from

326
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,959
animal planet and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in this</font>

327
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,189
case once again we know that somebody's

328
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,720
sending this traffic out there to

329
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,390
misconfigured and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that</font>

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're streaming HD quality video into</font>

331
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,199
nowhere once again very good candidate

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">for cleanup</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably track this</font>

333
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,830
person down 100 on the other hand is an

334
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,060
odd case it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ones that you</font>

335
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,820
that makes you scratch your head because

336
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,949
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of everything the</font>

337
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,800
there's very strong hot spotting

338
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,630
activity as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see once again and</font>

339
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,689
the distributions are fairly high and

340
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,939
they don't don't drop off as rapidly you

341
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,300
can see / 16 distribution on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

342
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:53,510
and / 24 traffic volumes on the right

343
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,089
and once again 100 100 100 is the

344
00:15:53,510 --> 00:16:01,010
biggest culprit by far but the others

345
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:04,670
are also not not not insignificant and

346
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,950
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the distribution by port</font>

347
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,839
numbers is also not very clear we see

348
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,820
some port 445 activity which is

349
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,630
configure once again some activity on

350
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,210
1640 we don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

351
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:21,620
UDP of course has source source

352
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:23,540
destination ports 10,000 161 we know

353
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,900
what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's SNMP misconfigured</font>

355
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:33,020
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of everything going on yeah</font>

356
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,640
so we're still<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only made</font>

357
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,490
one pass of analysis through the data

358
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,930
all we know is 100 / 8 is definitely

359
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,710
interesting it's got all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff</font>

360
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:45,020
we don't know the details about them yet

361
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,430
5 / 8 turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an interesting one</font>

362
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,560
and we were a little surprised by this

363
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,620
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think once again it's largely</font>

364
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,829
because of the five numbers very easy

365
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,300
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> humans to type and remember and the</font>

366
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,780
kinds of traffic we're seeing in here

367
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,160
are once again huge spikes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

368
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,939
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source of those spikes are the</font>

369
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,339
source IP is very the the

370
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,319
the rent the port numbers vary but

371
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:11,629
they're all 250 byte packets and they're

372
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:14,938
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros we don't know we're not sure</font>

373
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">ICMP six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic interestingly very very</font>

374
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:20,699
large volumes of icmpv6 traffic so if

375
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,050
anybody wants to know where ipv6 is

376
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,370
going to catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> on while probably dark</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">net and and some other interesting of</font>

378

flash video clips which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have which</font>

379
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,910
we haven't decoded yet so no more no

380
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,540
more video clips moving very quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

381
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:38,940
the other / aids 105 fairly flat very

382
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,560
uninteresting it's interesting to note

383
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the volumes that I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using on</font>

384
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,330
these graphs on the left right there's

385
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,070
this number right here is 14 gigabytes

386
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,659
for the other graphs this was of the

387
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:54,030
order of 200 300 500 so both 105 and the

388
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,240
45 are orders of magnitude more quiet

389
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,610
than the others very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest</font>

390
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,830
in terms of analyzing them we see

391
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,189
consistent patterns for 445<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

394
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,980
across 45 so to conclude very quickly

395
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:16,830
once again we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding that pollution</font>

431
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,619
obviously you're seeing people sending

432
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:06,899
RTP media there as well did you look for

433
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:09,869
any of these RTP streams that look like

434
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:12,889
g.711 you allow or or whatnot or did you

435
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:15,928
encounter that very often and no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

436
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:17,998
those were not standing out as obviously

437
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:20,879
as they were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1 / 8 i'm sure if we</font>

438
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:22,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">were to look a little bit finer you know</font>

439
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:24,299
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit deeper we'd probably find</font>

440
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:26,699
it there so yeah you can we can take

441
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,960
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah boy what</font>

442
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I found is these are people who are</font>

443
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,009
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> some fraudulent number in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font>

444
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,749
to rack up you know the premium toll

445
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:36,029
charges or whatnot and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

446
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:38,669
send the RTP media to somebody to

447
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:43,440
basically be discarded it or what not to

448
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:45,479
sell something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks really</font>

net<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was shocked and surprised you</font>

453
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,200
found to be relatively clean because for

454
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:04,109
many many years we've went setting up

455
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">the show we would announce the 45 / 8</font>

456
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:10,259
out of OCT one or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

457
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:13,109
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of size and crush it with all the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I never other people have I've never</font>

460
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,440
actually did any real analysis of what

461
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:22,590
was there so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comparison of</font>

462
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other slide shakes fact that it</font>

463
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,939
being cleaned to be shocking well its

464
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,739
comparative right so when I say clean

465
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,049
we're still talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 15 to 30</font>

466
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:32,639
megabits per second so with a t1 and

467
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,109
that's and that is consistent with what

468
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:37,340
we would see it usually it seemed to

469
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:40,970
average out around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2025 big Muslims</font>

470
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,970
great thanks

471
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,330
I don't know Winston sorry

472
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,689
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna get off the slide</font>

473
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,570
next up Jim cali for Renesys talking

474
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,450
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> egyptian internet connections</font>

475
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,899
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> there yo Jim Thanks how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

476
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,730
this again control l have this issue

477
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright thanks I've seen fuzzier even</font>

478
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,960
the normal it's because I have not

479
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:33,220
gotten a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sleep last five days and</font>

couple of friends to donate some slides

483
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,530
here to help us tell this tale Craig was

484
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,149
good enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me the arbor Atlas</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for that data what happened well you</font>

497
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,129
know from reading the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper what</font>

498
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,380
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what we saw was</font>

499
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,750
shortly after midnight<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday over the</font>

the major<font color="#E5E5E5"> Egyptian providers pulled</font>

approximately<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3500 routes many of which</font>

504

were little<font color="#E5E5E5"> D aggregates down to about</font>

now global<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgb convergence as you know</font>

507
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,080
takes about 30 seconds maybe at the

508
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,520
outside it takes 60 seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show</font>

509
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,860
you that these came in waves and they

510
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,240
were longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that apart so it's</font>

511
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,879
tends to suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there isn't one</font>

big kill switch its individual providers

513
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,540
in sequence leaving the net Miriam you

514
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,040
want to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look so I'll just jump in</font>

515
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:01,690
here to them show you what you've done

516
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:04,840
them at the ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCC the URL on top also</font>

517
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,460
has some life updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm graphs so you</font>

518
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,870
can follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what's going on at</font>

519
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment dear and these graphs look</font>

520
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,919
very empty but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a snapshot of</font>

521
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:15,669
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that dead time under</font>

522
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,490
27th 28th of January on top and we look

523
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,010
at the prefixes that were allocated to

524
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,890
Egypt by a fennec and look

525
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:25,650
announcements and withdrawals and can

526
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,770
clearly see how hard stops there on top

527
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:31,050
and at the bottom graph you can see the

528
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:34,110
number of renounce prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dropping</font>

529
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:37,139
at the same time so I'm yeah that's

530
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:39,629
quite impressive image I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah</font>

531
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,380
go to the website and you can follow you

532
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:46,320
know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue can take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over again</font>

533
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it's important to get this data from</font>

534
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
as many independent perspectives as

535
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:52,649
possible because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know any one of us</font>

536
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,270
could have blown this analysis so what

537
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened I mean back to the Renesys data</font>

538
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,080
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the ipv4 space as its</font>

539
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,360
laid out so we've made<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big heat map</font>

540
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,389
here using the Hilbert curve layout that

541
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,919
you've seen XKCD and elsewhere thanks to

542
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,500
the measurement factory for the software

543
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,680
so the grey blocks are routed the black

544
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,590
box blocks here unrounded space even

545
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,940
though the internet is now full and the

546
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,790
orange little dots you see towards the

547
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,160
middle there are Egypt and so if you

548
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">look before and after using the same map</font>

549
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,750
you zoom in on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> afro neck allocations</font>

550
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:27,810
and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the orange blocks that</font>

551
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:31,320
Egypt previously had just gone just

552
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:33,120
vanished so as I said before it doesn't

553
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,710
suggest a kill switch or I've heard

554
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,139
stories that all the infrastructure goes

555
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,760
through a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of hardware it</font>

556
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,630
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look the case to me if you look</font>

557
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,450
through this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will show you an</font>

558
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,830
animation at the end that that calls

559
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,120
this out even a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more clearly but</font>

560
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,919
these people are leaving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet a</font>

561
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,050
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes apart up to several</font>

562
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,700
minutes apart and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

563
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:54,030
it looks like sort of human phone call

564
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,290
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> skill it's interesting because if</font>

565
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,760
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back before hand you look for</font>

566
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,990
signs of congestion these are traceroute

567
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:03,150
Layton sees for our monitoring from New

568
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,500
York into all Egyptian prefixes and you

569
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,990
see that basically Layton sees were

570
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,370
pretty stable up until the point where

571
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,560
we couldn't do anymore Trace routes to

572
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,969
most of the prefixes in Egypt so you

573
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,649
don't see signs that the Egyptian

574
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">government was doing what I Ron did for</font>

575
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:18,140
example after their election which was

576
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:20,460
throttling and congesting on purpose

577
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,990
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting as a side note to look</font>

578
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,180
at the same view from the inside here's

579
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,440
our Cairo machine trace routing to

580
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,540
everything in Egypt and you know what it

581
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,880
still takes 180 milliseconds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 50th</font>

582
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,340
percentile mostly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of</font>

583
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">peering there as elsewhere is pretty bad</font>

584
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,899
and

585
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:40,950
traffic goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> London and comes back so</font>

586
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:42,780
what was left after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the event well there</font>

587
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,270
were several sources available and we

588
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:49,470
have tried not to identify all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

589
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,870
to graphically to the media we will show

590
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:55,169
you the one that everybody knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

591
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">um traffic did continue to flow by so we</font>

592
00:26:55,169 --> 00:27:00,330
here at sort of minimal levels there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

593
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,890
still some routes left even though the

594
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,540
routing is up routing is necessary but

595
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,919
not sufficient for connectivity lots of

596
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,799
the trace routes that you'll do inbound

597
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:11,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the remaining surviving prefixes will</font>

598
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:14,460
die on the sea bone at Palermo there's

599
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,649
lots and lots of sites in Egypt that are

600
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,940
reachable perhaps but they don't you

601
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,580
can't get there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have dns</font>

602
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,200
issues as an example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you could</font>

603
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:26,070
still get to the stock exchange until

604
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,070
before yesterday but the institution

605
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,500
that does their trade settlement was

606
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,450
down so at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point you know the</font>

607
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,679
internet connected economy falls below

608
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the critical threshold where you can</font>

609
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:42,090
actually do business ironically some

610
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:46,469
ipv6 actually stayed up is where a lot

611
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:48,120
of these were internet to<font color="#CCCCCC"> piers carrying</font>

612
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,490
ipv6 routes so if you kind of multiply

613
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet two times ipv6 I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

614
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:56,130
really noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were still up</font>

615
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,040
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that was sort of became</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">well known after the NGP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mon folks named</font>

617
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,629
them in the initial post which was the

618
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,570
newer group nor a group of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course didn't</font>

619
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,860
go down until yesterday no group is

620
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,030
interesting when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

621
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,899
reason they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been left on line</font>

622
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,059
is because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of great</font>

623
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,309
customers including the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font>

00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before in the financial industry</font>

625
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:16,700
also includes the commercial

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,389
international bank of egypt and the

627
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:25,980
egyptian credit bureau a few others so

628
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:28,020
status today about 75 prefix is still up

629
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,630
but they really don't trace I don't know

630
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot going on interesting</font>

631
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,049
when you telecom Egypt actually has some

632
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:37,020
Jordanian customers is about eight

633
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,879
prefixes for Jordanian space and we

634
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,040
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if that's co-located in Egypt</font>

635
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,510
or if its terrestrial but that stuff is

636
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,720
still online this was very much an

637
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,350
Egyptian event this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at all</font>

638
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,700
like the

639
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gyptian cable cuts that we've studied</font>

640
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,750
before as you've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in previous years</font>

641
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,000
when we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> our reports on cable</font>

642

cuts you see lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different countries</font>

645

and it's it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> broad spectrum event</font>

646
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,520
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was obviously very specific event</font>

00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:09,840
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> Egyptian prefixes down we are</font>

648
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,220
monitoring everything that's going on to

649
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,159
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else becomes unstable</font>

650
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,630
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just before I came up CNN was</font>

651
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,710
announcing that Hosny Mubarak will no

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:22,049
longer stand for re-election we'll do a

653
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:24,659
quick visualization here as promised

654
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:26,700
this is at something that guys back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

real-time speed playback so one second

per minute we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you what</font>

658
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,740
we call a piecewise Hilbert curve become

659
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,678
clear in a second depicting the actual

660
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,240
prefixes that Egypt had and then they

661
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:48,289
will flash white as they are withdrawn

662
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:52,470
and fade to black this is the still and

663
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:55,789
let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out here this is why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they say</font>

don't do this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main session</font>

665
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,200
good

666
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:10,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright fingers crossed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay time is</font>

667
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:13,340
scanning through at the bottom from left

to right<font color="#CCCCCC"> riya telecom in blue etisalat</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">egypt in pink and everybody else is in</font>

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:27,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">gray at the bottom and you see the</font>

673
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,649
blocks now flashing as we roll past<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

30 cairo time and that's it that's it

676
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,049
everything is now left you see a little

677
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">dust at the bottom which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the newer</font>

group and a couple of other small blocks

679
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,320
so the first this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again staggered</font>

680
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,840
sequence so te is the incumbent they

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:55,519
lead right off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raya goes</font>

684
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:02,029

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that everybody still has a</font>

little bit of space left it's a sort of

a gradual take down internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> egypt goes</font>

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,658
six minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> later and now we're really</font>

691
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:18,110
getting down into the bottoming out part

692
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:20,629
of this curve it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like watching</font>

693
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,189
soap bubbles pop as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> morse as the</font>

694
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:25,939
less specific skill a leading the more

695
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:29,450
specifics they're tiny they're gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

696
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the story so that's it</font>

697
