I

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,570
and then when you maybe shouldn't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,620
and what else you should consider before

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:23,200
just going in

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:28,930
straight into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so basically passive</font>

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:31,960
DWDM is DWDM is a dense wave division

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:35,309
multiplexing there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> coarse wave</font>

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:40,660
division multiplexing DWDM lives in the

9
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:43,089
1550 nanometer band and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have a true passive system there</font>

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't be any active components in</font>

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:53,020

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,510
the other so a couple reasons for using

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:00,489
DWDM in a passive state would be the

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:02,170
cost passivity liam is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap you</font>

16
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,979
don't have to buy extensive shelf

17
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,500
systems with you know varying cards just

18
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:13,860
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that light out into your dark</font>

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:16,330
fiber there's little complexity at all

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,610
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much as plug-and-play you</font>

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,650
take your fiber from your gear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:27,100
then your line side fiber whether it be

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,039
dark fiber from a carrier or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be fiber</font>

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,619
across your campus you just plug that

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the usual ed MUX from lux support</font>

27
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:39,100
on the corresponding shelf no

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:42,030
provisioning support wise there's

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,250
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> no additional support contracts</font>

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really you only have to plug it in</font>

31
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,750
so if you do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any problems you're</font>

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,460
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much just keep</font>

troubleshooting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same gear that</font>

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:57,039
you're used to troubleshooting and then

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:00,250
density wise the systems are very

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,360
modular so you can easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 82</font>

37
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,220
a 64 wave system and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> it consists of</font>

39
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:14,799
usually hold 16 shells or 16 waves in a

40
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:17,200
shelf the only downside<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you your</font>

41
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:20,019
gear doesn't support xfp optics and they

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,109
only support sfp+ right now there are no

43
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:26,050
widely available sfp+ DWDM optics so you

44
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,610
have to go the cwdm route

45
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,730
here's a actually picture here of how

46
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,950
you would configure this equipment wise

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,540
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the shelf on the left is the</font>

48
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,579
line side fiber and then each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

49
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,290
individual fibers on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top is say</font>

50
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:45,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">transmitted and the bottom is received</font>

51
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:48,049
for the given wavelength if you buy a

52
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,489
higher end unit because it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some</font>

53
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,560
standard ones that don't give you

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,340
provide you with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor port</font>

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,650
that'll give you additional capabilities

57
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:04,099
as far as by potentially using<font color="#CCCCCC"> an EDF a</font>

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:05,569
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> line side oir here's a quick</font>

59
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:07,959
little sample topology I wanted to point

something out with this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you is that</font>

61
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">since the shelves are pretty much unique</font>

62
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,360
to one another if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have two pair of</font>

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,660
fiber you could use the same color

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,579
optics in one chassis multiple times so

65
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,670
that you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way it allows you to</font>

66
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:29,150
have less sparing of optics because the

67
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:32,480
optics are a little pricey so this way

68
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have you know two of one</font>

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,700
wavelength to of another and that way

70
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,260
you don't have to waste money on you

71
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,410
know having four different<font color="#CCCCCC"> colors and</font>

72
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,870
four different spares a little bit of

73
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,139
information on the optics here just like

74
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:51,109
the tangoga lrx FPS they have pretty

75
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:53,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">much the same reach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> availability so you</font>

76
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,739
know they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 kilometers but in</font>

77
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,810
optimal conditions you can usually push

78
00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:00,079
from 25 kilometers easily without any

79
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,590
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of amplification you see the</font>

80
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:08,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">wavelength</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a higher wave of light</font>

81
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:11,750
then just a standard lr optic uses the

82
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,889
same single mode fiber that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use you</font>

83
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,230
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have in your fiber</font>

84
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:18,918
plant so it's really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the</font>

85
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,120
transition and then you know the one way

00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,099
to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> these out you can see in the</font>

93
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,800
across if not you may have to purchase

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,380
dark fiber between sites and that can be

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,700
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive again you know you</font>

98
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,250
the shelf or shelfs that you need for

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> capacity and then also the optics</font>

100
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,790
you know depending on your vendor they

101
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,380
list at 10,000 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean realistically</font>

102
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,350
you can get them from most vendors

103
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,260
between three and six so you know that's

104
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">another cost potentially and then in</font>

105
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,460
other countries that like the European

106
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,820
Union that was talking with remco<font color="#E5E5E5"> Metro</font>

107
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,039
dark fiber is so cheap there that in

108
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,860
some instances it's not a worthwhile

109
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,070
venue to use this dark fiber and passive

110
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,430
DWDM plus your vendor may not have

111
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,800
optics<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are supported only other</font>

112
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,090
considerations if you need redundancy

113
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,460
this won't give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the box</font>

114
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:34,750
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to duplicate your build out</font>

115
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,340
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be distance limitations where</font>

116
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,930
you would be required to use EDF phase

117
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,669
if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to go with a pure</font>

118
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,700
passive system then it wouldn't

119
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,890
necessarily be truly passive port

120
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,800
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> availability if you are going</font>

121
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,150
to be you know creating<font color="#E5E5E5"> a redundant</font>

122
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,670
configuration you will meet you will

123
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:56,859
need double the ports on your gear and

124
00:05:50,670 --> 00:06:00,310
that may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be available also you know</font>

125
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,810
if your fiber gets cut you lose

126
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,280
everything whereas if you had an active

127
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,450
solution that may have a protected path

128
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,849
it would automatically switch over

129
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,979
another downside is you know the vendors

130
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,170
sometimes have a 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus week lead time</font>

131
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,520
just to receive the optics so if it's a

132
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,890
rush thing and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this up</font>

133
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,169
you know you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan for it and</font>

134
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,599
then without any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of up active</font>

135
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,700
equipment you won't get any oir from

136
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,880
this other<font color="#CCCCCC"> than what the gear that</font>

137
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,688
terminates the fiber on each end provide

you with

139
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:33,879
and just as far as the other reading go

140
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">razz had a good presentation back at</font>

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,320
fill out the surveys so they serve a

162
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,810
about the network issues in the data

majority of the cost I on servers power

171
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,149

172
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,779
create big barrier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data centers</font>

173
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:24,500

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:37,009
they have to crack into servers changing

well the biggest broadcast messages we

<font color="#E5E5E5">than others that's the primary reason</font>

234
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,560
breaking a large network into smaller

235
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,630
subnets no longer work anymore because

236
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,768
the broadcast messages are sending

237
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,860
through the

00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:32,069
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> core part of network and switches</font>

this case the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OP messages will be</font>

00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:00,299
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transition there will be</font>

without any response coming back and

00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,999
then they were repeatedly sending those

251
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:12,299
requests causing more messages in the

252
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:16,739

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:27,860
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some possible ways to</font>

261
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:42,839
can combine two smaller location smaller

domain when the layer to spin across

263
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:49,290
multiple racks or multiple rows or you

264
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:52,949
can use director based approach which

265
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:56,368
can be centralized or distribute method

266
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:59,719
to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> art which is the like layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three can delude protocol okay</font>

268
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,549
here just talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

269
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:09,149
better but our main intent actually is

270
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:12,059
to create a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group in IETF we</font>

271
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:14,759
call arm d which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a address resolution</font>

272
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:18,860
for massive number of hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the</font>

273
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:22,549
data center so initially we try to

274
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:26,579
document the scalability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our and</font>

275
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:29,180
indeed indeed for ipv6 with increasing

276
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:31,579
number of hosts in the data center

277
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,300
and and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I limitation of those</font>

278
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,370
protocols and provide design design

279
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,910
recommendation and how to minimize the

280
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:43,850
issue and secondly<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe phase two is</font>

281
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,680
potentially develop some solutions to

282
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,900
better support data centers with large

283
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,569
number of hosts and with the desire of

284
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:54,709
letting host to be placed anywhere in

285
00:14:50,570 --> 00:15:00,790
the network so that's and any<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

286
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:06,350
actually we are looking for feedbacks hi

287
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:08,480
hi i paid my er um have you considered I

288
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,130
mean I followed the army mailing list so

289
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,030
I got a pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of what's the</font>

290
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:16,430
discussions about but if if you look in

291
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">the really large scaling scaling things</font>

292
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">in really big data centers you can't</font>

293
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,500
really broadcast anything so the reality

294
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:27,770
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know anything that and this</font>

295
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,630
includes things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dhcp so have you</font>

296
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,329
considered have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered the</font>

297
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,970
possibility that art isn't the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arp as we</font>

298
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,920
know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

299
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:39,230
well we agreed that office now the only

300
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,030
problem when you allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts to be</font>

301
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,850
placed anywhere in the network it's

302
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:46,040
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the only problem but in</font>

303
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,470
IETF every time they create a working

304
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,230
group they want a very small focused

305
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:54,170
working group that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> drill down</font>

306
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,940
to arp and ND is well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is not</font>

307
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all the problem dhcp is another</font>

308
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,600
issue too i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that uh well the</font>

309
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,550
art you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> our scaling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one issue</font>

310
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,910
via mobility is you know something

311
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:13,920
different so can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be solved by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arp in</font>

312
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:21,209
some ways but agree um

313
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:25,410
okay so Dave you've suggested that that

314
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:28,649
two hairs they've you suggested that our

315
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:32,160
pen solve it in some ways and I think

316
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see is what pieces</font>

317
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:40,469
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> can solve in the general situation</font>

318
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,139
and in mobility it's clear that it can

319
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,300
solve some mobility problems it cannot

320
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,579
one of the first things we're doing is

321
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,680
looking at the actual statistics from

322
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:53,579
actual networks and we'd love to talk to

323
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,099
anyone as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just saw before lunch we</font>

324
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:58,019
had Yahoo's facing the general problem

325
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,209
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think our first thing is</font>

326
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,070
information gathering that we can

327
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:05,099
publish and discuss we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

328
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:07,319
private discussions but I think we're

329
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:10,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to first hit public data that we</font>

330
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:15,209
can debate and then go from there okay

331
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:16,678
just one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to emphasize is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 44</font>

332
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,299
problem in data center there are many

333
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,569
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> approaches to solve it right</font>

334
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:24,569
as we saw in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top by yahoo before</font>

335
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:28,460
lunch their approaches to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP</font>

336
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:33,418
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the server so allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

337
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtual IP to be on different location</font>

338
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,059
that's the ultimate goal right allow

339
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,720
those holes to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere in the</font>

340
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,070
network and our approach it is slightly

341
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,590
starting from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network that they are</font>

342
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,200
two layers three blue part and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

343
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,330
them scale to allow that happen without

344
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,179
all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcast ages broadcast</font>

345
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:55,428
messages floating in the links and

346
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,429
switches<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

347
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:03,000
thank you next we have

348
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,820
he doesn't

349
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,060
see more

350
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:40,529
can you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it big</font>

351
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:43,019
oh yes hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm ken florence from netflix</font>

352
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:46,450
and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk to you about a</font>

353
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:47,980
blog post<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did we've gotten a bunch of</font>

354
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:50,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions on it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it might be</font>

355
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:57,669
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea to stand up here and take</font>

356
00:18:50,379 --> 00:19:02,259
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more maybe so basically a couple of</font>

357
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:04,179
days<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we posted on our tech blog some</font>

358
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,740
information about what we see in terms

359
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">of netflix performance on various</font>

360
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:12,190
networks and I'll what I'm going to do

361
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:14,320
is go through kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how we do it why</font>

362
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:18,669
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and and so a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail</font>

363
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">on how it all works so what we do is all</font>

364
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:22,389
of our streaming clients are either

365
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,149
written by us or based on an SDK that we

366
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:27,418
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SDK there's lots of</font>

367
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:29,199
specifications about what we want to log

368
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,139
including a lot of performance

369
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,080
information and as we get those logs

370
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:38,379
back we capture the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address from the</font>

371
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,470
clients that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were connected with and</font>

372
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:44,168
assign an AS number to those IP

373
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,450
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we group</font>

374
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:49,259
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and assign the performance</font>

375
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:52,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">characteristics of the various networks</font>

376
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:55,360
so basically the clients are talking to

377
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:58,929
a bunch of Netflix servers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AWS</font>

378
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">cloud those netflix servers then pass</font>

379
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:05,230
along the logs to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hadoop cluster that</font>

380
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't map reduce on them that data</font>

381
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,070
processed data is then piped back to our

382
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,039
data warehouse and our netflix data

383
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,600
centers and then we have some reporting

384
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:17,559
servers that can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slice and dice</font>

385
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,719
it for us so why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this we're</font>

386
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,340
kind of in this interesting position of

387
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,970
getting a tremendous amount of

388
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,590
long duration<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-definition views so</font>

389
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,470
really seeing what can be supported<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

390
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:33,080
terms of sustained through put on these

391
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:35,929
various networks obviously we get a lot

392
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">of questions you know both anecdotally</font>

393
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:42,140
and through many other means friends

394
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:44,750
about how performance works what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

395
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,720
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they when their client clauses</font>

396
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,400
etc we also get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

397
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,220
do we feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like any of the networks are</font>

398
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,169
manipulating our traffic in any way and

399
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,149
so we felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this would be a good way</font>

400
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of get some data out there</font>

401
00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:00,559
in public and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we don't see any</font>

402
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,279
evidence of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that today and it also</font>

403
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,480
obviously helps us understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the</font>

404
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">performance is changing over time and</font>

405
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,580
and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can expect as time goes on</font>

406
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:15,408
so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff we'd like to</font>

407
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:17,270
do better here one way is to make a

408
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:18,919
slide with that many lines readable is a

409
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,230
little bit challenging so if anybody's

410
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,870
like particularly good<font color="#CCCCCC"> Excel food that</font>

411
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:27,320
they want to share on how to do that I'm

412
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:29,600
open for suggestion also we've gotten a

413
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,830
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about something that we</font>

414
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,059
knew was going to be an issue when we

415
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,899
put out the chart I didn't have a good

416
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:38,120
answer which is AT&T and Verizon have

417
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:41,449
obviously a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of dsl offerings most of</font>

418
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:44,120
a lot of fiber offerings and since we're

419
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,130
doing this by a s number we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

420
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,559
good way right now of splitting that out

421
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,240
so if anybody from either AT&T or

422
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,418
Verizon or anybody else has any good

423
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,980
ideas on how to help us do that you know

424
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,750
I guess we could figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what IP</font>

425
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,240
blocks are being used for what and try

426
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:02,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">and post process the data like to avoid</font>

427
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if possible but anyway open for</font>

428
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,850
input on that didn't get the message the

429
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,360
memo that embark<font color="#E5E5E5"> and centurytel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

430
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,240
CenturyLink when it goes

431
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,570
so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta fix that and and there's</font>

432
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,429
lots of other interesting metrics we'd

433
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,500
like to look at every time we track

434
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,120
internally not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time-weighted bit</font>

438

metrics but we've got a lot of

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,760
interesting data to carve through and

440
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,620
always looking at better ways to kind of

441
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,920
understand client performance and how we

<font color="#E5E5E5">can improve it only put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four Canadian</font>

ISPs on the original Canadian chart

444
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:47,760
because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four canadians</font>

445
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,020
that fell in the list of top and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SS</font>

446
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,460
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at we want to dig</font>

447
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,040
deeper into that and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

448
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,780
there's a lot more that we could do to

449
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:03,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">improve so here's the almost readable</font>

chart any questions

451
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,919
when you send out an email that asks you

452
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,169
know how was your streaming experience

453
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,380
is that triggered by metrics you see or

454
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,690
is that prayer<font color="#E5E5E5"> ly random it's it's</font>

455
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,340
random it's basically we're just always

456
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,460
looking for people's input we found that

457
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,560
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good way to identify</font>

458
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,060
streams that had encoding problems and

459
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:43,370
stuff like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of a QA</font>

460
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:43,370
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ anybody else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we're done</font>

468
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,709

reliability of it what I recall<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's</font>

475
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:28,799
at least the last time I looked at it
