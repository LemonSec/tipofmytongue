299
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:05,150
frisco did you have to change your

ice be or die on the ice in oxfordshire

304
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:22,370
you say it has a province of very

307
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:34,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to to build new to support it I I</font>

308
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:45,949
did not unwise effect on rotor bars over

309
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:52,240
Wi-Fi world yet and but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yoshi a fruit in</font>

310
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:55,460
Oceania and dns query very many many

311
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:03,520
queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieved and the operators</font>

312
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:03,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">preserved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its queries sorry I</font>

313
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,899
sorry Chris cool so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think this</font>

314
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,540
question was did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you add more servers to</font>

315
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,059
your set because of this increased load

316
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,300
or did you consider removing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat and</font>

317
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:23,000
firewall and doing look you know doing

318
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,419
the local anycast load balancing or some

319
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,559
other options it seemed like you

320
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,410
identified some bottlenecks and instead

321
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:33,320
of removing those bottlenecks with<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

322
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">tested technology you said well more</font>

323
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,230
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this it will be bad yeah let's</font>

324
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:43,460
probably will be bad I think well we

325
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:46,880
hope to decrease perfect queries and bye

326
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:55,250
bye brother probably not gonna decrease

327
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:57,050
over time hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean from Mozilla Jesus go</font>

328
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,370
back to the slide 11 I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

329
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:05,659
lemon I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to look at the this</font>

330
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:07,610
right yeah that's correct before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so is</font>

331
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:11,540
there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why you took data only</font>

332
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:14,510
for one hour is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a reason why sample</font>

333
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:17,659
data is just an odd oh because that

334
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,280
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really small time frame for</font>

335
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:25,070
the amount of DNS that is you guys are

336
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:30,320
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I have a more more data</font>

337
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:34,189
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other sis take a monument I know</font>

338
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,309
the reason i ask that is every firefox

339
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,960
browser that is not modified source not

340
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">modified does not have modified source</font>

341
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,410
will hit a us to at least once a day so

342
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,660
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually find out the number of</font>

343
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:51,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">firefox users accurately pretty much if</font>

344
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,520
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so yeah I think one</font>

345
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,310
hour seems to be really small

346
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,280
you have by the data it could get us

347
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:02,100
what father say is needed yeah yeah and

348
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,070
based on it last comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you're</font>

349
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,770
not going to see any of this lesson

350
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:09,330
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah clauses are going to be</font>

351
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,910
look at it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perspective of user</font>

352
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,939
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these are the things that</font>

353
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:17,130
actually speed up or it's also called

354
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,490
perceived performance it makes it look

355
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,050
that your browser is faster whereas but

356
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,810
browser vendors are always going to put

357
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:29,520
in stuff like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know speed it</font>

358
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:32,129
up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hi Eric us for</font>

359
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,290
our son loves I just wondered i think i

360
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">might have missed this what what were</font>

361
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:38,040
the big negative effects that you

362
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually saw like do you see like</font>

363
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,120
performance degradation or I mean I but

364
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,230
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

365
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:49,129
breakdown and I just wondered if you

366
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:49,130
what specifically bad things happen hmm

367
00:23:50,210 --> 00:24:02,310
I don't know we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the rise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

368
00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:05,430
queries and that's okay just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let go</font>

369
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:08,100
a couple of comments there with

370
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:10,110
validation going to be happening on the

371
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,000
number of n systems it's quite likely

372
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,370
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see more queries</font>

373
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,250
originated from the end system so just

374
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:21,419
just to support that<font color="#CCCCCC"> statement also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

375
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of curious if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you study some of any</font>

376
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,290
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might happen to the</font>

377
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,439
bandwidth in terms of what what might

378
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,820
have been cached data what what is

379
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,540
effectively the change of having so many

380
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,540
additional queries

381
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,959
do any analysis of how much of that data

382
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:48,600
being requested was already cashed at ER

383
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:51,570
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sober or what was unique so</font>

384
00:24:48,600 --> 00:25:02,010
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss all fresh okay this</font>

385
00:24:51,570 --> 00:25:04,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">next okay anybody else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright thanks</font>

388
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,590
confirm the the number of queries you

389
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,799
said 150 that is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> per second</font>

390
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:24,090
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single Firefox user was at the</font>

number oh this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh sick single single</font>
