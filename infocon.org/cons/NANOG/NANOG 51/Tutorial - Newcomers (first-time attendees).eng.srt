1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,790
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use I used to serve on the</font>

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,760
program committee for about the last

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,250
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> years one thing you'll find out is</font>

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,230
there

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,750
different committees that are the run an

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,279
org when you serve on the program

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,050
committee you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can only serve a maximum</font>

9
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,750
of two<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms on the program committee</font>

10
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,070
before you then get turned out so that

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,900
would be four years if you serve the

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,150
maximum term which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I just did</font>

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,040
and the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is it keeps the</font>

14
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,870
program committee fresh all the time it

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,489
keeps fresh ideas coming in rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,650
the same program committee being there

17
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,599
for like ten years and putting the same

18
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,620
boring old thoughts on so it's important

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the program fresh and</font>

37
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,570
are interesting I mean particularly

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">knowing the destination or squirrel</font>

39
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,320
appreciation day which i think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

40
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:38,540
I certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't know about two weeks</font>

41
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:41,029
ago so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um also have you ever been to a</font>

42
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,400
network ops or sysadmin tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

or convention before so yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have in</font>

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:52,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">lunches who hasn't bout half the room</font>

45
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:55,070
that's cool okay one final question and

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,939
then I'll stop ask any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions are you</font>

47
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,408
local for your hands up it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

48
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,750
quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people travel only sort</font>

49
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:04,939
of four or five local people okay we get

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,869
about thirty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> newcomers to most</font>

51
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:10,220
nano of meetings and that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font>

52
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,350
fairly consistent but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall</font>

53
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,269
attendee members don't go up every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

54
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:18,109
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get 30 st. groping members and</font>

55
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:19,850
attendees so what we're wondering was is

56
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,519
it just that people will come because

57
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,019
they're local or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people will</font>

58
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,380
come just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the missing contents</font>

59
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,610
interest

60
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,260
that kind of thing so what what people

61
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,420
coming for when they come to nana what

62
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,290
are people looking for well well first

63
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,929
of all they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to learn</font>

64
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,579
interesting stuff so they're hoping for

65
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,340
listening listening to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

66
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,990
talks learn from some great speakers

67
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,590
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably haven't had chance to</font>

68
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,480
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> before and you know just just pick</font>

69
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,680
up ideas the other thing that wants

70
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,540
there's also catch up with folks that

71
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,460
they know already so people from within

72
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,530
their own industry people that they get

73
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:01,610
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see regularly and meet regularly back</font>

74
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:02,960
home but maybe catch up with him it's

75
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:09,230
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> something out of a sci-fi film</font>

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's more height on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them ok so the</font>

79
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,330
catching up with folks that maybe

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,040
they've met through a previous meeting

81
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,950
and meet face-to-face so a lot of people

<font color="#E5E5E5">come here for hallway conversation the</font>

83
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,220

84
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,769
do is meet with new folks that hopefully

85
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,720

107
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,789
effectively how the meeting is made up

108
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:28,010
is it's made up of tutorials which run

109
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,290
today there's then the general session

110
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,110
which is the whole conference together

111
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,340
in a great big ballroom at being 500

112
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,380
seats and a big podium at the front

113
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,849
and those are all just<font color="#CCCCCC"> single track</font>

114
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,190
talks with everybody in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same room</font>

115
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,690
and then the thing called tracks or

116
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">buffs which is where we break out into</font>

117
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,010
smaller groups of more specific interest

118
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:51,520

119
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:54,430
the afternoons at Monday and Tuesday got

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,159

we didn't all carry laptops around it

127

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:56,380
moment in case you're not aware for a

146
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,080
long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> now always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been an activity of</font>

147
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">merit Network the academic network</font>

148
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,770
provider in Michigan<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

149
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,950
inheriting inherited running nanog from

150
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,090
how things were done in the NSFNET days

151
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,280
now log has gone through several changes

152
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,580
over the course of its life cycle from

153
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,799
from the original<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

154
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:22,210
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> its next sort of growth spurt if</font>

155
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,800
you will and what is happening is valid

156
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,200
is going to cease to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> B America</font>

157
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,940
activity from the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting and it's</font>

158
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,240
becoming its own activity with its own

159
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,099
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> with its own board of directors</font>

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,450
so that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite incidence it's</font>

161
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:38,680
an exciting and interesting time for

162
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:40,150
nanog but hopefully as far as the

163
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting attendees are concerned you</font>

164
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,479
won't see any significant differences

165
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,370
than hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meetings will stay at</font>

166
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,060
least the same in terms of quality and

167
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">content</font>

168
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,540
and hopefully it will continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

169
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:55,030
improve but<font color="#CCCCCC"> your nanog you have a say</font>

170
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,870
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your meeting so ze you get</font>

there was green dots black is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

227
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,330
network security guys and there's a

228
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,740
people tend to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in the</font>

229
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:08,660
security block so as I said before the

230
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,540
agendas broken down into different types

231
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:16,670
of sessions and tracks and things like

232
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:20,020
that so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> general session is basically</font>

233
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,459
podium<font color="#CCCCCC"> give talks given from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the podium</font>

234
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,370
with time for questions at the end each

235
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:29,660
talk blast between usually 30 30 minutes

236
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and 45 minutes and everybody just sits</font>

237
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,630
together really in the same room and

238
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,880
it's just that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing going on</font>

239
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,070
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time we also try and have like</font>

240
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">hittin some different types of types of</font>

241
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,540
things in terms of we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find some</font>

242
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting keynote speakers when</font>

243
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,740
whenever we can the other thing you'll

244
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,410
see is you'll see buffs and tracks and

245
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,960
those are much smaller groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

246
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,610
they're usually not podium podium base

247
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,350
they're far more sort of floor based and

248
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,070
a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> discursive smaller group as</font>

249
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,920
well so yeah 150 people may be to run

250
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:04,370
tops and that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's much</font>

251
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,560
smaller much more easier to much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

252
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,150
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have discussion and those tend</font>

253
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,780
to be like they're less podium focused

254
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:13,130
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interactive tutorials</font>

255
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,839
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> those this afternoon we've got</font>

256
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:18,350
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> great stuff on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 there's some</font>

257
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,840
stuff on DNS SEC and there's also I

258
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:24,050
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> steenburgen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't like</font>

259
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,130

260
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,709
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned and then there's other</font>

261
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,240
happenings that happened during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the week</font>

262
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,950
so when we all decide that we don't or

263
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,450
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to sit together in the same</font>

ballroom anymore and we break out<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

266
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,360
tracks what is it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

267
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,570
have um decide what you're going to do

268
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,980
um first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all naming sometimes they're</font>

269
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,290
called buffs and sometimes they<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

270
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,380
tracks they're pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the same</font>

271
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,880
really buff stands for birds of a

272
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,290
feather so that was kind of when you get

273
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that were interested</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">specialist interest groups as you said</font>

285
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,860
and so go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a look at the agenda</font>

286
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,270
see what things look interesting to you

287
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,500
what they also some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these some of</font>

288
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,880
these buffs and tracks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their own</font>

289
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,560
communities that have known each other

290
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,850
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> years but don't be put off by that</font>

291
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,469
they these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people that known each</font>

292
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,270
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> for years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they often they're</font>

293
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,970
drinking together they know each other

294
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,710
outside of work sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll go</font>

295
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,089
and look in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go oh I feel like</font>

296
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,970
a bit of an outsider but don't be put

297
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,110
off just try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> join in and then</font>

298
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,360
because everybody is actually here to

299
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,220
meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that's if we go back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

300
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,510
of the early slides you here to meet

301
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,490
other people there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also small groups</font>

302
00:11:53,510 --> 00:12:00,470
as I said much much easier to get

303
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:03,950
involved and come here to participate

304
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:07,460
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think most of</font>

305
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,870
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe to get drunk but when</font>

306
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,580
you're mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> year to participate so</font>

307
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,650
don't be afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of asking questions that</font>

308
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,760
this floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> mics in every room so you'll</font>

309
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">find that there's a big mike in the</font>

310
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,920
stand in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this room don't</font>

311
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,540
be put off this chaps Pieter Cohen

312
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,140
you'll probably bumped into him during

313
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:27,050
some point of this week and he'll that's

314
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,910
really grumpy cranky questions but don't

315
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,540
be put off by people like Peter they're

316
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,980
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really nice honest whenever you</font>

317
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,770
do use the mic state your name and

318
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,810
affiliation for two reasons first of all

319
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,130
people know who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are rather than go</font>

320
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,599
well who's that strange guy with the

321
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,689
beard but ask that funny question and

322
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,490
people will know who you are and if they

323
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,780
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seek you out to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

324
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,459
question later they'll know who you are

325
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,230
and where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find you that's there's</font>

326
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:52,699
another important thing the other reason

327
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,260
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> state you should state your</font>

328
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,880
name and affiliation is for the webcast

329
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,770
because all the main sessions our

330
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,920
webcast so that people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> participating</font>

331
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:04,699
via the webcast can let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who's</font>

332
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,020
actually asking that question there's

333
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:11,690
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for questions at the end of</font>

334
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:14,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so um lightning talks they're</font>

335
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,839
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick 10-minute maximum and</font>

336
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,060
the program committee choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

337
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,069
previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> day so they're submitted as</font>

338
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,258
very solicited sorry during the meeting

339
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:25,709
people submit them during the meeting so

340
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,449
even you could do a lightning talk if

341
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:28,768
you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> so inclined and it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

342
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:30,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic that's very last minute and</font>

343
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,129
relevant I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I'm sure they're</font>

344
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,319
probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some lightning</font>

345
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:38,790
talks on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Egyptian</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net network</font>

346
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:41,729
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> takedown it doesn't have to have</font>

347
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,529
slides it could be opinion as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so</font>

348
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,120
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's vetted by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the program</font>

349
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:47,129
committee is somewhat different to how

350
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll make a general session you have 30</font>

351
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:50,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">45 minute talk is better because it's</font>

352
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,220
lightweight it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font>

353
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're quick to prepare quick to do and</font>

354
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,490
you may find you have an interest in

355
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:58,079
discussion with somebody and the next

356
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">two days and think how we could do a</font>

357
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,019
quick lightning talk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and that</font>

358
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,660
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if people could just</font>

359
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,100
participate at the first meeting so

360
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually talking about disappearing at</font>

361
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,910
the first meeting is there any newcomer

362
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:15,870
in the room who's actually giving a talk

363
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:17,189
three wow that's cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> four fantastic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

364
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,149
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go yeah people who come into</font>

365
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,559
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting and they're already</font>

366
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,279
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand up on a podium and talk</font>

367
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:25,170
about stuff which I think's brilliant

368
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,230
important stuff now beer and gear so

369
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,839
yeah here's a big switch and I think

370
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was like one of the brocades</font>

371
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,689
there's brocades stands up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

372
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,730
meetings and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought like a new</font>

373
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:37,139
thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and it was a real one I</font>

374
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,480
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Greg and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said is that</font>

375
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,519
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fake could display one that</font>

376
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,649
won't work and said no no it's a real

377
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,389
one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be put back</font>

378
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,899
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and ship back soon as this is</font>

379
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:52,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">finished so Billy is just one way we</font>

380
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,970
engage our industry sponsors I think

381
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,290
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important that we actually</font>

382
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">do continue have a good sponsorship</font>

383
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,800
stream because that keeps the whole

384
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,240
overall price of the meeting down so

385
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,849
it's actually affordable for people to

386
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,279
attend but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really horrible</font>

387
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,199
if there was like vendor sales talks and

388
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,819
all that kind of thing being put in the

389
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,099
program so actually what we do instead

390
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:12,990
is we say well you know you sponsor a

391
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,550
cocktail<font color="#CCCCCC"> an hour and you can bring the</font>

392
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,490
stuff in and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a stand and</font>

393
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,079
you can bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring material in there so</font>

394
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,569
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monday evening network in food</font>

395
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,489
and drinks and there's a bit a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font>

396
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:25,030
swagger and stuff like giveaways and

397
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,770
that kind of

398
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,420
and this is a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spread that you</font>

399
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,150
get beer and getting lots of food and

400
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:36,920
and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and good chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

401
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:38,900
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat and catcher and sponsor</font>

402
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,760
contributions also provide food<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

403
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,170
breaks and also continental breakfast

404
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,730
each morning so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry</font>

405
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about finding breakfast if you're</font>

409
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,109

410

474
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,650
and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go</font>

481
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:46,230
blocks and we giving you 90 minutes to

482
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">go and get lunch and it's not starting</font>

483
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">till one o'clock by the idea behind that</font>

484
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,640
is that the sort of midday lunch rush

485
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,940
has already gone and passed through the

486
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,230
the restaurant hopefully when like ten

487
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,840
hundred years come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and say well have</font>

488
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,750

<font color="#E5E5E5">seating person goes that then actually</font>

490
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,840
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to feel this phase by suddenly</font>

491
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,170
coming up and asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> table for a</font>

492
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,949
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some information</font>

493
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,180

496
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:22,230
some of varying price ranges one of the

497
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,880
I think one of the ones nearest to the

498
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,990
hotel is actually a very expensive

499
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,980
Italian so just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think Nia don't</font>

500
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,420
fall into the trap into the place

501
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,030
nearest to the hotel because it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

502
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite an expensive lunch but there's</font>

503
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of other stuff over it sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

504
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,950
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of downtown area in terms of</font>

505
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,510
sandwiches

506
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:45,250
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff the other thing as I said</font>

507
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,050
before I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like I'm repeating myself</font>

508
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:50,130
and probably am it is not all about the

509
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,389
talks the talks are interesting yeah and

510
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,980
they're one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that help you</font>

511
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,600
justify to your boss why you should give

512
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,360
you money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come here and sign off your</font>

513
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,860
travel but it's a big chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet</font>

514
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,240
with lots of other people lots of other

515
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,149
like-minded folk that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing the same</font>

516
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,010
sort of jobs as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it's a good place to</font>

517
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:08,680
learn it's a good place to spread clue

518
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,780
between people so take a look through

519
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,730
the attendee list I can don't be afraid

520
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,660
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking questions networking always</font>

521
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,980
and more than anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy the socials</font>

522
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,110
Monica had decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take karaoke</font>

523
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,640
to a new high and got on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stage at</font>

524
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,879
the last social and started singing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

525
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,860
the band but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something going on</font>

526
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,100
most nights as well as beer and gear all

527
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">attendees are welcome and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vm we</font>

usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise not to make you sing</font>

529
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:41,020

530
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,760
this into you before you leave tell us

531
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,710
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think there's a survey usually</font>

532
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,960
for every day so we building why they

533
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,550
asking us again and again well it's

534
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually important to work out what</font>

535
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,669
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of each day as it happens</font>

536
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,260
because we may be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

537
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,640
something more quickly during the course

538
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,379
of the week so something that people

539
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,070
didn't like on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday can be fixed by</font>

540
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,390
Tuesday the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

541
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,600
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit different in terms of the</font>

542
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,280
content and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the spread</font>

543
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,840
between buffs and tracks and things like

544
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the survey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for every day you'll</font>

545
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,449
see people stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the podium and</font>

546
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,520
say fill out<font color="#CCCCCC"> your survey and they really</font>

547
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,900
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what what what sort of</font>

548
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,520
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys want to get out and out</font>

549
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,850
on what worked well and it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

550
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,680
anything from the content of the talks

551
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,870
to actually logistics of the meeting

552
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,510
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was not enough cookies</font>

553
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,830
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the break or something like that</font>

554
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,720
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that is important because</font>

555
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,919
it helps fine-tune the logistics of the

556

meeting and makes all the meetings in

558
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,490
an incentive will make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

559
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:45,130
