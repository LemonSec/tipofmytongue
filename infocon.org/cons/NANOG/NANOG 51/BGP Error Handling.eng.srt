00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,530
hi there I'm Rob<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shakir as it says in</font>

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,420
the slide own from Cable and Wireless I

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,509
work in the

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,920
designer an architecture type role and

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,110
one of my key focuses at the moment is

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's into protocol resilient and error</font>

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,660
handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this this talks are based</font>

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,210
off an IT internet-draft that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put</font>

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,040
together the kind of describes from the

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,350
operators point of view what the

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,480
requirements are for bgp are handling

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,820
and how we make this protocol kind of as

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,870
robust as possible and we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of</font>

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the headaches that we perhaps</font>

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,699
been experiencing as operators so the

17
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:46,559
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intention of today is to the</font>

18
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:48,780
draft tends to be quite a heavy document

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,309
is to try and stand up here and and talk

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,530
you kind of threw what what the draft

21
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,589
says what the idea behind it is and to

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,030
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we get that the basically</font>

23
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the operational community thinks that</font>

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm not i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying this the things</font>

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,159
that I'm saying are actually accurate

26
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,039
and the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm saying are are</font>

27
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,440
what reflects<font color="#E5E5E5"> our reality because the</font>

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,450
there's there's a big split between the

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,920
IETF and the operational communities in

30
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,090
some ways the operational communities

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,590
tend to be easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get involved with</font>

32
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,060
maybe from one operators point of view

33
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,100
and the IETF it's got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of process</font>

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,780
so it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really great to get a lot of</font>

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,250
foam to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback from you guys and</font>

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,869
there's a feedback form at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end so I</font>

37
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,490
I'd really<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate it as much as</font>

38
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible but the real the structure of</font>

39
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,469
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through that the draft</font>

40
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,420
and explain perhaps some background so

41
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off with a couple of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">phone of diagrams and this this is</font>

43
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,090
really because then at the start of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">RFC that describes bgp it says BG before</font>

45
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,689
is an inter all tournament system

46
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,490
routing protocol so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

47
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,869
the way that we that maybe this a kind

48
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,048
of implies your network probably looks

49
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:51,659
so is this a typical SP network I don't

50
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so but what what it had you know</font>

51
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,649
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> used some mpls terminology here for</font>

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,029
node names though just ignore it there I

53
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,679
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to kind of point out that</font>

54
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,600
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> core boxes there's some</font>

55
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:03,210
edge boxes and in your core you're

56
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,579
probably garden<font color="#E5E5E5"> igp and that you're</font>

57
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrying your rare in this view you'd be</font>

58
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,770
carrying your customer information and

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,068
you'd be carrying your infrastructure

60
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,049
prefixes in and you'd be carrying any

61
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:15,239
information that told that your network

62
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,740
that was relevant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internals of</font>

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,280
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how to get to different</font>

64
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,170
exit points when you then were

65
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,510
connecting with another company or

66
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,159
another peer or another net

67
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,769
you would use some exterior gateway

68
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,150
protocol and that was either

69
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,220
redistribute the bits that you needed

70
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,140
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your IDP back into the into the</font>

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">exterior gateway protocol that then lets</font>

72
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,768
you propagate the routing information

73
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,299
that you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to you to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

other autonomous system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

75
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,579
really i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of view the bgp</font>

76
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,940
was built looking at and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

77
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:48,739
how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> before but i think your</font>

78
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,840
your modern Network maybe looks a bit

79
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,430
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this we've got a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

80
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,650
changing requirements we really need

81
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,780
like a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick to converge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

82
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,280
because we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them we've now the</font>

83
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,829
convergence requirements for what we're

84
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,470
carrying on IPR a lot to a lot more

85
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">strict than they were before and so what</font>

86
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,980
we have in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp instead of having</font>

87
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,720
this all this routing information that

88
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,730
told us how to get it get anywhere in

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,930
our anywhere out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a domain we just</font>

90
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,108
really have some information that tells

91
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,269
us this is our domain we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> reach</font>

92
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:18,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability information from each p tells it</font>

93
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:20,090
or each node in the network knows how to

94
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,069
get to each other node in the network

95
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,720
and we might have some really core

96
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,488
infrastructure prefixes like your

97
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,720
management or your authentication

98
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">service and that kind of thing but</font>

99
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,859
really probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> most prefixes are not in</font>

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,299
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP anymore it's as small as</font>

101
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:35,690
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> because then it converges as</font>

102
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:37,400
quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we then</font>

103
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,198
look at well what are we now using

104
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,269
internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> to propagate information and</font>

105
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,690
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the answers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp so there's</font>

106
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:46,280
yeah as we've kind of overlaid more

107
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,739
services onto the network we've started

108
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,849
to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay actually we've got we</font>

109
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,109
all have this routing protocol that

110
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,119
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> already so let's use it</font>

111
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,519
internally and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's propagate and</font>

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,129
service information so<font color="#CCCCCC"> vpm before maybe</font>

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,599
and other topologies in this protocol

114
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,010
and what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has really given rise to</font>

115
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,988
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> given rise to a big change in the</font>

116
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,780
way that maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp looks in terms of how</font>

117
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:08,419
is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's implemented because we've</font>

118
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,590
now got a in this example I've got a

119
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,769
route reflector but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

120
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">be got techniques to kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scale I'd I</font>

121
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,548
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP and what that means is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you look</font>

122
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,320
at may be looking at sessions that are

123
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,880
now taking much more importance because

124
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,500
they're carrying all the information

125
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,630
that's for every service in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network</font>

126
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the reason that that that's</font>

127
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,500
important is now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> these sessions break</font>

128
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,820
your network probably doesn't have any

129
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,470
services great and knows how to get

130
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,599
around the inside of it but it doesn't

131
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,950
know how to get it to run any of the

132
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,710
services the actual things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

133
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,590
customers pay

134
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,750
you for so really i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of my</font>

135
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,299
key point here is that you run<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP is</font>

136
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,250
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP in some ways you run all the</font>

137
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,230
service information is now propagated in

138
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,960
that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mekin in in that kind of</font>

139
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,420
manner and the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp is really just to</font>

140
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,159
bootstrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp as soon as you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

141
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,780
up then that's that's where the useful

142
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,180
routing information is there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

143
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp just handles failure cases</font>

144
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,280
inside your network so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">error handling and I'm going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

147
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,480
about why is this actually an issue why

148
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,790
why am i up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

149
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if we if we had errors and we</font>

150
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,840
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem then then I</font>

151
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,250
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here right because I</font>

152
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,859
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wanting to try and talk</font>

153
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,330
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should change it so the</font>

154
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,160
that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a picked out a few events</font>

155
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,200
or not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an exhaustive list it's</font>

156
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,970
more a list of ones I think are notable

157
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,860
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one the first one is said</font>

158
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,390
to do with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> four by a SS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attribute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

159
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,950
this was introduced it's an optional

160
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,770
transitive attribute that was introduced

161
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,229
to carry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for byte routing</font>

162
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,750
information across boundary across and

163
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,660
networks and across systems vgp speakers

164
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,760
that did not have support for it and

165
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,190
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> January 2009 was there</font>

166
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,960
Cisco released some code that had a

167
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,300
strict implementation of the RFC it said

168
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,090
f you see a confederation set in the in

169
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 4 x s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attribute then you should tear</font>

170
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,469
down the set well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should handle this</font>

171
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">as an error and unfortunate there was a</font>

00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">juniper bug that was that was copying</font>

173
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,250
this information in and some autonomous

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,200
system somewhere didn't have a border

176
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,860
got removed and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

177
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,440
noticeable about this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is in</font>

178
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,730
the internet so and it turns out that

179
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,160
lots of people haven't weren't running

180
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,540
code that did for by air support so what

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,880
you ended up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with was you ended up with</font>

182
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,410
a prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that had an attribute on it the</font>

183
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,540
way the attribute propagated quite a

184
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,010
long distance and as an autonomous

185
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,480
system on the internet you're much more

186
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,830
likely to see a prefix through your

187
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,780
transit provider than you are through

188
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,729
appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> also because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just because of the</font>

189
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">fact that you've got a transit session</font>

190
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,720
with all the prefix with all the table

191
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,980
on it and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meant was that when</font>

192
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,930
the arrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> was handled it was Herod</font>

193
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,140
handled by your ingress system towards

194
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,910
your transit providers router and the

195
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,650
mechanisms of the pros comment that tore

196
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,390
down the session so if you'd run this

197
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,039
code on all your border boxes you could

198
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,669
very easily isolate yourselves from

199
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,280
parlor

200
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,930
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the second one I want to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is to do with them AAS path</font>

202
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,950
this was we've seen a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few of these and</font>

203
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">there they tend to be for differing</font>

204
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,550
reasons but the key one that want to

205
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,130
talk about is there was I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

206
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,570
a mikrotik bug which what when it was

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented it meant that instead of</font>

208
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting I think that basically the</font>

209
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,810
problem was the prepend mechanisms was

210
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,310
inconsistent and you ended up with his<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

211
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">s paths there were hundreds and hundreds</font>

212
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,620
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS is long and I think there's</font>

213
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,080
there's even a<font color="#E5E5E5"> site of thing that tracks</font>

214
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,550
how really long ass paths and whether

215
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,490
they look like this bug and what

216
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,660
happened was this visser update came in

217
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,820
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long s path attribute</font>

218
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,110
which is now well no mandatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

219
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,790
something we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a routing</font>

220
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,050
decision based on so it's now really

221
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,760
important that this that this

222
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">information is correct because if it's</font>

223
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">not we can't make a routing decision</font>

224
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,809
properly and what happened was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aids</font>

225
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,659
a receiver side boat and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Isles boxes</font>

226
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,610
that received it couldn't actually

227
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,140
passed it incorrectly and couldn't pass

228
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,270
the fact that this a s path was so long

229
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,460
and tore down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tore down the session</font>

230
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,280
so again another attribute that comes in

231
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,960
via transit provider and it was if only

232
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,059
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had that IELTS implementation</font>

233
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was that was buggy were you going</font>

234
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see this so again it's a it's that</font>

235
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sessions that failed could be they</font>

236
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,070
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been internally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

237
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,540
network but they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also been in</font>

238
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,490
your transit providers or repair where

239
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,890
that was that was important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font>

240
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the notable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is one prefix that</font>

241
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs this not not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole table the</font>

242
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,280
next one I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is it's</font>

243
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,870
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more recent and this one</font>

244
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one to me is why this this</font>

245
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,430
indicates if of why this is a big

246
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,800
problem for us because so ripe ncc and

247
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,350
duke university decided they were wanted

248
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a an experiment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finally you know</font>

249
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,760
those that it's the default for routing

250
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,290
table you can you can use that you can

251
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,390
you do an experiment on if you'd like

252
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,949
and what they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they introduced a</font>

253
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,260
an optional transitive attribute that

254
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,750
had no meaning that was three thousand

255
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,280
bytes long or so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think and what</font>

256
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,590
happened was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was actually a</font>

257
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,990
bug in terms of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x are propagated</font>

258
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,810
this update so that your they<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced</font>

259
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">de</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am zips and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your urogram edge box</font>

260
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,229
and zips would receive this prefix with

261
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,339
this attribute on that doesn't mean

262
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,840
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making any routing</font>

263
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,320
decision based on it and announced it

264
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,630
back into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network in a</font>

265
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,820
humana so whatever was<font color="#E5E5E5"> p reappearing</font>

266
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,100
with your your border-box internally

267
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,390
tore down the session and that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

268
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,560
that that was from your roof late to

269
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,170
your border<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots and your boy toy box</font>

270
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,810
might not just be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 so you</font>

271
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,550
affected every every prefix on that

272
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,979
session and every address family with

273
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,689
also by because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an experimental</font>

274
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,060
prefix that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

275
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,430
you didn't have it this is no impact to

276
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,459
you at all and i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

277
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,199
unfortunate thing connotes<font color="#CCCCCC"> light</font>

278
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,790
openness prom but the last point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

279
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,010
most important because that there are

280
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,870
failures in ibgp we get lots of them

281
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,250
right though<font color="#E5E5E5"> well there are some and we</font>

282
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,170
know that networks have had them and

283
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,300
there are definitely occurrences within

284
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,680
service provider networks but I we can't

285
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,359
have an exhaustive list of them because

286
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of not published nobody wants</font>

287
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stand up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and go all this happen</font>

288
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,560
because there was a bug in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

289
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,040
implementation and then this happened

290
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,349
this happened so but these failures cost

291
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,750
you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money there where you make</font>

292
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,100
likely inside your<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s you're charging</font>

293
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,210
your customers more for that service

294
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,860
you're doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be an overlay</font>

295
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,960
service or you've got a much bigger

296
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,300
customer state it's not just say one

297
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,160
transit connection or so so these kind

298
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,780
of failures are really impact really do

299
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,319
impact people's networks and do cost

300
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,850
operators a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money so why does</font>

301
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,860
this happen I've kind of talked for that

302
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we see section tear down what why</font>

303
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is a really</font>

304
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,219
simplified view of what's happening if

305
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,840
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an update this that you think is</font>

306
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,420
erroneous doesn't have to be erroneous

307
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,580
but you think it is then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

308
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,079
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only mechanism in BGP at the moment</font>

309
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to notify the pier on the</font>

310
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,110
other side is to send a notification

311
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,819
packet and in 4271 RC 4271 it says if

312
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,860
you send a notification you must tear

313
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,450
down the session so the basic you're

314
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,460
saying this was an error I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

315
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody about it but the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

316
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,430
you've got to do then is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got to</font>

317
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,080
tear down the session and though there

318
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,819
is some utility and as I can't come back

319
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,100
to why there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some utility in it and</font>

320
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,140
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of limiting the</font>

321
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,390
scope of these invalid updates but in a

322
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,660
lot of cases this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe this is this</font>

323
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:01,210
is really really suboptimal I think so

324
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just kind of summarize the of this</font>

325
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,930
section<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is later the</font>

326
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,790
justification for why we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

327
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,550
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanism see whether it's</font>

328
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,920
going to change

329
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,540
is the cause of the issue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really that</font>

330
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,729
there's a limited tool say under

331
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,260
standards at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment it's you've</font>

332
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,420
either got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> discard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and attribute that</font>

333
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,890
you do thought was erroneous or discard

334
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,079
the update with all the implications of

335
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,910
that and all you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to respond with</font>

336
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,260
a notification there's not it's not that

337
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,519
there's an implementation that's just

338
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,439
ignoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that there was a more</font>

339

flexible way to do it actually there

340
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,160
isn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> more flexible way to do it at</font>

341
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,810
the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it for us to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

342
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,829
do to amend that we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

one and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that I'm trying to</font>

this of these session tear downs is

massive could be a transit appearing

363
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,230
coming back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this fact that I said the</font>

sees are all routes that would go via

that that note it just would not is

372
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,740
unthinkable so the robustness

373
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,339
requirement is really different if you

374
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,839
when you look at how bgp is being used

375
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,920
so what's the intent of what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

376
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,410
trying to do and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm working with</font>

377
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,620
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the thing is</font>

378
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,310
in the ITF there's a there's a lot of

379
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,260
implementers there's a lot of vendors

380
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,520
but there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that many operational</font>

381
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,500
people and whether our operational

382
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,819
people are they you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font>

383
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,279
other operational people who are hired

384
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,140
by an operator to do standards work or

385
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,579
are they people who've used boxes you

386
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,990
know is it someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's types of a</font>

387
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:08,630
Rueter in the last two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years or five</font>

388
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,790
years or however long it is and so I

389
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,160
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define how</font>

390
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,779
we use bgp and to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

391
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,160
documented what the critical nature

392
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,060
isn't the

393
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,650
unfortunately they we don't really have

394
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,939
a framework ourselves to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as</font>

395
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,709
an operational community to write a

396
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,240
document that says that the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

397
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,070
we have is the ietf standards process

398
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,950
and they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard process so</font>

399
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,570
let's go and use that and then I think

400
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to provide the requirements of</font>

401
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,800
what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we want because</font>

402
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,090
there's there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> two there's two camps</font>

403
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
there's a robustness camping and there's

404
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,720
a protocol correctness camp and you

405
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,310
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't satisfy both at the same</font>

406
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,620
time you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make some compromises</font>

407
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,420
in both of them so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

408
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,640
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what will compromise on and</font>

409
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,410
define y will compromise on it why we

410
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,050
don't think it's an issue and then the

411
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of</font>

412
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,410
disparate work in the IETF often so that

413
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,240
there might be this draft over here and

414
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,430
another one over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really is an</font>

415
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,990
operator one of them doesn't go unless

416
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,329
we've got the other one because we can't

417
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,560
it's very typical of monitoring things

418
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,850
you might implement a feature but if we

419
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,130
can't monitor the feature then it

420
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,630
becomes really difficult for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so I</font>

421
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,900
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tie together the framework and</font>

422
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,160
make a framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> that deals with this so</font>

423
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is how we're going to</font>

424
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,910
approach it so or how the draft

425
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,300
approaches it if you think it's wrong

426
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,860

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,449
don't send a notification where can we

428
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,530
avoid sending a notification packet

429
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,120
because we know that if we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

430
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,400
notification we've got to tear down the

431
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,810
session so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

432
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,189
at is how we avoid sending the

433
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,569
notification in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

434
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,210
the implications are sending that are

435
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,650
the second one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we avoided sending</font>

436
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,900
a notification which means now we're

437
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,819
missing some routing information or we

438
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,410
did something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what the scope is so we</font>

440
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,800
might end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in an inconsistent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> state so</font>

441
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,240
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is we want to</font>

442
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,010
look at can we get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

443
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,380
inconsistent state without having to go

444
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,730
over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process of</font>

445
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,730
resetting the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we did before</font>

446
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,350
or can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we what mechanisms can we do to</font>

447
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure that that was it's an</font>

448
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,890
implementation error or it's a bug

449
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,510
that's not going to go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that the</font>

450
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,850
second pie is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how we get back</font>

451
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,150
to having a consistent network and the

452
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,200
third one is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some utility and</font>

453
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,900
I'd really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to come back to this</font>

454
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that I I've kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of sold</font>

455
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,079
it is notifications really bad but now

456
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm saying hey we should restart bgp</font>

457
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,020
anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should restart BTW</font>

458
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,130
if we take if we take the the assumption

459
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,050
that there was some utility and

460
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,910
restarting the session then it'd be

461
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">great if it was hitless and because</font>

462
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the really the thing</font>

463
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,220
care about<font color="#CCCCCC"> right the forwarding impact</font>

464
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,900
is what what hurts us when when the

465
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,760
session restarts we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really care</font>

466
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,319
that there was some internal protocol

467
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,850
stuff that was relearning those roots

468
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,170
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was Hitler if it was hitless</font>

469
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,340
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really notice that and if that</font>

470
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,319
gets us out the error condition there

471
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,850
was definitely utils you too and then

472
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fourth one is so like a</font>

473
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,790
dimension we need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor</font>

474
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,230
all these mechanisms and especially in

475
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,000
this case because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're doing is</font>

476
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,460
we're making the protocol more

477
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,470
complicated and when we make it more

478
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated then if unless you can see</font>

479
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,790
what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on then we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of</font>

480
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">a problem so here's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first bit which</font>

481
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a void in sending a notification so</font>

482
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,880
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a this mechanism has kind of</font>

483
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,790
been discussed on in in the ITF for a

484
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,070
bunch of time and it it's a it kind of

485
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,589
came from the fort<font color="#CCCCCC"> by air stuff but it's</font>

486
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,390
been mentioned before it sir basically

487
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,760
if we've got root<font color="#CCCCCC"> array here on the left</font>

488
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,230
and rigidly on the right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rueter a</font>

489
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,630
transmit some update and for whatever

490
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,630
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roo Toby thinks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is an</font>

491
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:25,280
erroneous update or it could be there is

492
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,260
no assumption as to which side thinks is

493
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug is on which side the issues on</font>

494
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,819
their nerds but we've got a case where

495
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,710
we've got an erroneous update as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

496
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,570
we can determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the prefix is what</font>

497
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,310
the nlr I in that information will in

498
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,980
that update packet was then we can say

499
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,079
right that guy's advertised as some new

500
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,460
and routing information but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

501
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,530
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we'll do</font>

502
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,300
is we'll just won't trust that prefix or

503
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,310
that set of routing information from

504
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,839
that gut<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> router and we treat</font>

505
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,849
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as though it was withdrawn but the</font>

506
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,960
key thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is now we can if we do</font>

507
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,490
this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to send a</font>

508
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,080
notification because we've kind of said

509
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,100
right we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use that subset</font>

510
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,900
of the routing information that you've

511
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">given us we don't really need to tear</font>

512
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:05,300
down the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gives us a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font>

513
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,040
be able to avoid having send one and the

514
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,319
thing that we do have there is though

515
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ruto ratings is advertised some prefixes</font>

516
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,208
to repeat and<font color="#CCCCCC"> beadon doesn't let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> air has</font>

517
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,650
not accepted them but a has no real way

518
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,270
of actually working out that they

519
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,580
weren't accepted so we've got some

520
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,020
inconsistency<font color="#E5E5E5"> across those two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peers and</font>

521
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,849
if you think that where it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

522
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,550
more specific or so then you might end

523
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,649
up with either<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruta be has no path sorry</font>

524
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,120
has a loop back to back to some other

525
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">point was just forward straight at it</font>

526
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,870
again all the other thing that it could

527
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">be is that now we've just treated this</font>

528
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,199
is withdraw and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't have</font>

529
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,610
another path we're black holding traffic

530
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,370
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is obviously suboptimal</font>

531
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,290
and so we

532
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,120
we compromised on the fact that the

533
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,070
topology is consistent but we've

534
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,300
compromised due to the fact that now one

535
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,570
set of routing information is

536
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:52,149
inconsistent not the whole session we

537
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,970
haven't lost reach ability to 99.9

538
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:57,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent at the table that was fine and</font>

539
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,630
there's a 16 work in the in the ITF at

540
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,150
the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> NK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> francisco's put</font>

together<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eb g</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Paris draft but which</font>

542
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,400
includes the optional transitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece</font>

543
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,689
of work that was 44 by a esas but we

544
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,840
need to extend this to cover ibgp

545
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,220
because as my kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of use cases look</font>

546
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,080
kind of pointed out we care a lot about

547
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,550
ibgp and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think everybody does because</font>

548
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,460
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm making quite a lot of</font>

549
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,780
money or that's where i'm making margin

550
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,220
let's not assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually making</font>

551
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,720
money so that the second thing is we've

552
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">got in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case where we've now got an</font>

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,880
inconsistency across<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a s22 bgp</font>

554
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,960
speakers we need to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we get</font>

555
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,670
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because obviously we don't</font>

556
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the fact that we've got</font>

forwarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop or with black hole and</font>

558
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,440
traffic because that's that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

559
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,780
what we're here for right we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to</font>

560
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,480
forward packets so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we push some way</font>

561
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we re request the</font>

prefix or or retain re relearn that

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,660
routing information to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now</font>

564
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:55,030
the store consistency and so my the same

565
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,970
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of mechanism as before</font>

566
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,649
it's maybe and we've got some with a

567
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,080
root or en route to be we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

568
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,280
withdrawn prefix enroute to be and we

569
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,139
can look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's different ways</font>

570
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,000
the request that prefix right so there's

571
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,110
I the only one that's their

572
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,510
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now is a brute</font>

573
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,770
refresh so which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is fine but</font>

574
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of load there</font>

575
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,250
and that will leverage the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

576
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,809
update packing and that kind of code

577
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was used it in the first place</font>

578
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:22,030
maybe to advertise to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so if we can go</font>

579
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,340
and ask with<font color="#CCCCCC"> there with a filter I just</font>

580
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:27,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">want this prefix again please then what</font>

581
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">will get there as we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a.m. we get</font>

582
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,460
that maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> can leverage a different code</font>

583
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:32,140
path or we can know we can re receive

584
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,840
that prefix we could we knew what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

585
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,070
prefix was because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could pass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the nlr</font>

586
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,620
I because otherwise we couldn't have

587
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,169
treated it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> or withdrawn set of reach</font>

588
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,489
ability information the other way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

589
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,830
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go and ask for the whole</font>

590
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,330
alone the whole rib and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kia Patel from</font>

591
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,340
cisco has put together a draft that

592
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives us a consistency it gives us a</font>

593
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,309
start of

594
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,229
re<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertiser's ribbon and end of riad</font>

595
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:55,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">vert eyes room that then lets us work</font>

596
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:56,469
out that actually this was the whole set

597
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,899
of routing information that we should

598
00:19:56,469 --> 00:20:01,479
have had so these two work items<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

599
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:03,820
do answer the the kind of this kind of

600
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:05,229
problem we can now request a single

601
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,820
prefix so we can request the whole rib

602
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:10,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've give ourselves a chance to get</font>

603
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,218
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to being consistent so now okay</font>

604
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,439
we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of think about what</font>

605
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:16,929
did notification give us what was in

606
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,999
there in the standard what's the

607
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,799
motivation to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do notification and</font>

608
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,999
there's kind of two this one we don't

609
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,339
want to propagate this routing

610
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:26,409
information any further so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just we</font>

611
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:28,089
terminate at the fact that this route

612
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,200
are over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here might be inconsistent it</font>

613
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:30,879
might be an estate which is not

614
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,559
trustable so what we do is we tear down

615
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:34,178
the session and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't learn that</font>

616
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,559
routing information anymore but the

617
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,749
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that it gave us was it gave</font>

618
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,309
us a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reset the numerous bits of</font>

619
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:40,989
state that's it with a btb session

620
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:43,089
because so there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things you</font>

621
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">know like a TC is a TCP session start</font>

622
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:46,330
with so we've got some state<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

623
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:48,070
maintaining their so what we'd get by

624
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,839
doing a notification is we get a chance

625
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,809
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> both speakers to rebuild all those</font>

626
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,849
all those structures to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

627
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">a chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring this session back up</font>

628
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:58,119
but what was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing as operators we</font>

629
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:59,589
didn't like it that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's not</font>

630
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:02,408
really the fact that they were prefixes

631
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:05,200
were relearned it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bandwidth or</font>

632
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:06,519
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU maybe for the for that rhian it</font>

633
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,649
was the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that during that we have no</font>

634
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,330
forwarding for that set of prefixes so

635
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:13,508
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we want to do is we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

636
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,859
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding plane</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and affect the</font>

637
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:16,269
forwarding plane while letting a restart

638
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:17,949
happen and we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a mechanism</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

639
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:19,839
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> already right it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fiji be graceful</font>

640
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,429
restart but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of talking</font>

641
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,928
about hey let's take that because it

642
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:24,999
seems like this was a good good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

643
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,249
get out of errors and in general we

644
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:28,599
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these errors that that go on</font>

645
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:31,629
and on in when you've got a notification

646
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,999
so can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use this mechanism and extend</font>

647
00:21:31,629 --> 00:21:36,099
it and there's a draft-day no that's

648
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:38,139
called so soft notification but expired

649
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:40,149
back in two thousand six so we probably

650
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,889
have to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and see can</font>

651
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:43,718
<font color="#E5E5E5">we just take the graceful restart</font>

652
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:46,359
mechanism and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fit it around what</font>

653
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:48,159
we round the error handling kind of case

654
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:51,369
for it but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more work</font>

655
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,779
required to revive it so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final</font>

656
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:54,099
thing and I kind of struggled with how

657
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,479
to how to discuss this because it would

658
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,309
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to discuss it on going through</font>

659
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:59,859
what the monitoring mechanisms who need

660
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,889
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> are is then isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the monitoring</font>

661
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:03,199
so the

662
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,900
at the moment if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your knock gets a trap</font>

663
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,550
of this bgp of session<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's down then</font>

664
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,380
that's quite visible to them right you

665
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,730
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sam and the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

666
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,200
you've got a forwarding failure you're

667
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,300
going to get a phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> call or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know</font>

668
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,890
so you gonna your<font color="#CCCCCC"> knock is going to know</font>

669
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,010
about these mechanisms right now it's

670
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:20,360
quite easy to do so but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start</font>

671
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing things where we could suddenly got</font>

672
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,139
one prefix that's not not accepted on

673
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,510
this session<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you but</font>

674
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,310
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that that then is a lot</font>

675
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,050
harder for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my first line guides not</font>

676
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:32,090
escalating the second line guys to go

677
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">while the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP sessions fluffing I don't</font>

678
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,689
really know what it is but I can see

679
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,310
this if he goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really know I</font>

680
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,270
can't see the prefix here I can see the

681
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,679
prefix here and there's no real

682
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,629
mechanism to go actually there was an

683
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,340
error on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix then that starts to</font>

684
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,520
make make things pretty difficult to

685
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,040
deal with so we and the other problem is

686
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,410
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got two speakers and on either</font>

687
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,060
side of them we might to treat one we

688
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,380
might take some action<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one and we've</font>

689
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,879
got no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of telling the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other one that</font>

690
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,320
we did something whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> notification</font>

691
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,780
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> flap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sector both sides of the</font>

692
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,070
session right so it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what we</font>

693
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,930
really need is we need some way to be

694
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,360
able to have both guys both sets of

695
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:09,140
knots look at their route or both people

696
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,669
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be themed teams or your</font>

697
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,500
operator look at both boxes and know

698
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,750
kind of what happened from each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of each</font>

699
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,070
one's perspective kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how we do now</font>

700
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,660
and there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drafts there's</font>

701
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,939
and this one that Dave Freeman and Tom

702
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,350
shoulder and I think rich the frigid

703
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,690
steenberg are working on which is

704
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,419
advisory which is a free text way to be

705
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,160
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propagate messages between</font>

706
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,690
two peers and but it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

707
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,190
extendable draft so we can look at right

708
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,420
okay what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to propagate part</font>

709
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,250
of the packet do we want to give the

710
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,780
what visibility which<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

711
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,640
give to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other side but at the moment</font>

712
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,170
we don't have any mechanism by which we

713
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,570
can propagate that information between

714
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,970
those two speakers and really for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

715
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,560
it's much better if it's in band for

716
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,300
that kind of lightweight protocol

717
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,620
because there otherwise we get crazy

718
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,649
suggestions like well we should just

719
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,879
syslog at each other and I think I don't

720
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,130
know about you for the security

721
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">implications of opening at them syslog</font>

722
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,550
to another company or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a somewhat</font>

723
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,390
concerning to me I've already trusted

724
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:04,070
this then the my peer and we've got some

725
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,720
cop or whatever it is that's controlling

726
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,040
that and messaging so an inbound

727
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,780
mechanism is very useful for that

728
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,950
there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a secondary draft that's a</font>

729
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,050
bit more detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives a bit more</font>

730
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,240
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is diagnostic and</font>

731
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,629
that's that's come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's</font>

732
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,830
got

733
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,570
what specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it starts to be</font>

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to ask well tell me about what this</font>

735
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:22,189
sir what what this state or what this

736
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,960
count is on the preface then the other

737
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,180
thing is we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got we know that we have</font>

738
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp analysis mechanisms right</font>

739
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,710
so we we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like right there</font>

740
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,540
is and those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools with this</font>

741
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,550
protocol is so key to us as<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

742
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,580
operators and as any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of IP</font>

743
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,530
operators that we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

744
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,449
monitor is could we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be looking at</font>

745
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so it kind of almost justifies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

746
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that we use another protocol to</font>

747
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,390
look at what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> states across two</font>

748
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,250
places the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> boxes is and if it's an</font>

749
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,720
important enough adjacency the control

750
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,340
plane overhead paid perhaps to do that

751
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,560
separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro squad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really worth it</font>

752
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,120
especially is now independent errors in

753
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,710
your monitoring protocol become

754
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,030
independent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the session itself so</font>

755
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:06,230
there's a draft in the grow working

756
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,820
group in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF that that is vgp</font>

757
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,530
monitoring protocols fight starts to

758
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">find a protocol how we can look at that</font>

759
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:15,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of information out of bound to the</font>

760
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:17,090
session but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've taught through a bunch</font>

761
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,360
of mechanisms kind of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

762
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,709
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they fit together and so if we</font>

763
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,840
start on the left<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand side but get an</font>

764
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,610
erroneous packet we treat it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with we</font>

765
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,120
could if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can determine the nlr I we</font>

766
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:30,949
treat it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with drawn if we so and then if</font>

767
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,110
we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can optionally go and</font>

768
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,640
ask for one time prefix or but it'd be

769
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could ask for one time</font>

770
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,510
previous because that would mean that

771
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,920
that we we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go through the</font>

772
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:43,190
whole load of three advertising the rib

773
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,660
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work then we</font>

774
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,220
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the next</font>

775
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,630
thing we do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> request the whole rib</font>

776
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,890
from you give me give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole rib</font>

777
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,230
again and let's see whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get out</font>

778
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this error condition if we still</font>

779
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,400
don't exit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> error condition or we</font>

780
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,080
couldn't treat it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> withdraw and then</font>

781
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,790
the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> real option we've guys we don't</font>

782
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,070
can't limit we don't know what this

783
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,570
limit was on in terms of routing

784
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,250
information that was wrong so hit me do

785
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,230
a Hitler session reset then maybe we get

786
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,930
another chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get things consistent</font>

787
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,370
again but then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the error after I</font>

788
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,780
hit the session reset and we just get

789
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,790
into a loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> because what do we start</font>

790
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing and the other problem is widens if</font>

791
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,240
there's multiple prefixes that got

792
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,120
errors do how do we handle this this

793
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,280
together so the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the this</font>

794
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,449
complexity is I've tried to discuss it

795
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,250
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft is getting a bit into</font>

796
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,900
implementation detail but

797
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,210
a recommendation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do</font>

798
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,130
is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be tracked precession</font>

799
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,530
because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack it put prefix</font>

800
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,360
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> state sounds horrible to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me it</font>

801
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds like it doesn't scale and it</font>

802
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,320
sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an implementers nightmare if</font>

803
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,489
we do a per session state<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what we</font>

804
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do is you can say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually there's</font>

805
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,480
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with this pier but it is</font>

806
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">stable enough to get the session back up</font>

807
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,010
again after he's advertised after we've

808
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,390
set reset it because if the box is

809
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,310
completely broken on the other side

810
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,900
probably when I try and reset<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

811
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,240
session it's not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come</font>

812
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,370
up again<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's in such a bad state and</font>

813
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,550
at that point yeah this pops covering a

814
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:03,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP session up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its so it's broken but</font>

815
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:06,740
otherwise if we mark the session as bad

816
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,240
we've got some subset of the the routing

817
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,130
information that we're missing but maybe

818
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,710
we're happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that because what we've</font>

819
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,850
got there is we've got a and we can flag

820
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,350
that to operator we've got the

821
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,820
monitoring mechanisms to make sure that

822
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,889
now somebody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this box</font>

823
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,200
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an inconsistent forwarding state</font>

824
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,520
but let's let a human make her make a

825
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,290
decision about how important this is

826
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">because if it's really important maybe</font>

827
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,470
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to turn the session down</font>

828
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,580
but at least for the time period in

829
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,870
while you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at it you have</font>

830
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,810
forwarding for the rest of the table

831
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:35,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that wasn't broken so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why am i standing</font>

832
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,490
here I've tried I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of explained</font>

833
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,080
this but as operators we are the people

834
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with the fallout of protocol</font>

835
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,490
issues so I'm you I guess there's a

836
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:45,260
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this room who do on</font>

837
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,180
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get woken up at 3am when</font>

838
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:50,270
BGP is broken to something important and

839
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:52,310
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means is that personally I</font>

840
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:56,629
have a big motivation not to be woken<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

841
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:59,210
at 3am um I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> sleeping thank you so</font>

842
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,410
and if we and your vendor might get

843
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,290
called out but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a goes on</font>

844
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,820
shift right so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really should it's</font>

845
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,790
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if we can define as</font>

846
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:11,810
operators why this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken and why it</font>

847
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:13,639
should be more robust and the the other

848
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,110
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it costs operators more money</font>

849
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,050
right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an SLA on software</font>

850
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,370
from a vendor so we get this bug and

851
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,379
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is we just push the</font>

852
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,760
bender to fix it but it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set</font>

853
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,220
of paying service credits out based on

854
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,230
the fact that the the service was broken

855
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,330
for however many hours it was broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

856
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,280
so if we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an agreed operator</font>

857
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,449
recommended approach it's really easy to

858
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,660
kind of stand up and go well<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

859
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,000
what we want and we are

860
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this is a customer view of maybe</font>

861
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,740
into the vendors also<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gives us a</font>

862
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,479
input into the standards process where

863
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,390
the two views the implementer and the

864
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,080
operator view can be really well and

865
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:50,670
determined so I'm really really seeking

866
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,370
questions comments and review of the

867
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:56,010
draft it's the URLs just up there so

868
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,050
it's it's a bit long it was kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

869
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with a decent title so that's</font>

870
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:02,550
the hardest bit of writing I think so

871
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:03,810
hopefully if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you've got time to</font>

872
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,710
review it or if you've got interest to

873
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,929
review it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be much appreciated</font>

874
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the other thing is i put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font>

feedback form because that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,060
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> some discussions I've had here this</font>

879
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,060
operate a divide and it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

880
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,340
great if we could start looking at the

881
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,840
the way that we fit that together<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

882
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,490
see what so if you've got ongoing

883
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,199
interest as a check box on the form and

884

I<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not to spam you but if you</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in touch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> once once we've worked</font>

887
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:32,610
out what that how that brick bridge

888
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,160
might get get how that gap might get

889
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:37,280
bridge and thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much for</font>

890
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,280

hi dave friedman from clarinet and have

892
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,920
you given any thought to the

893
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,210
multi-session approach that's going

894
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,520
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye dr at the moment with</font>

895
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,400
regards to how sessions can be separated

896
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,930
based on me happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sappy such that if</font>

897
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,780
one session breaks the others are

898
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,040
preserved yes I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spock up slide</font>

899
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">bout this actually because it's one of</font>

900
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,920
the common questions and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

901
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,540
is with multi session is that at the

902
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,950
moment it's not really standardized and

903
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,960
doesn't really fit in that well because

904
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not single port we end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

905
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,680
crazy situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just kind of</font>

906
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,540
moved the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP session out to some other</font>

907
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,070
port and that then doesn't fit into your

908
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,040
control plane policing all that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

909
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,899
rate limiting but really and at the

910
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment for you've probably got your room</font>

911
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your network unless you're</font>

912
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,270
accidentally running it you're probably

913
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:34,360
running multi multiple afi's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font>

914
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,740
session so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we if we have an error</font>

915
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,719
there then what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is send a</font>

916
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,760
notification for that that session but

917
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,290
even even in the case where it did only

918
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fi it still breaks all the</font>

919
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,210
other prefixes that were in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that AFI and</font>

920
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,580
I work on a quite a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> health free VPN</font>

921
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,550
network and so the motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and</font>

922
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,409
and separates apologies I don't care

923
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,850
that that there was an error in<font color="#CCCCCC"> V p.m.</font>

924
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:56,980
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I care that there was an error in</font>

925
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">one topology maybe so unless I can</font>

926
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">separate that out to a single topology</font>

927
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:04,060
possession rather than a single safi or

928
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:06,310
a fee then it doesn't it doesn't work

929
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">but this is this is a scaling nightmare</font>

930
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,480
and I think if I said oh you should work

931
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:12,100
out how to build my topology map based

932
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,170
on what our T's are imported everywhere

933
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,899
then build a session for one thing per

934
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,510
connection then I might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot by a</font>

935
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,600
vendor so hope I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it solves</font>

936
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,750
the problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it helps excellent thank</font>

937
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,750
you

938
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,939
thank you
