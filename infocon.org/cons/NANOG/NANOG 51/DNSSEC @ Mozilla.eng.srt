1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,020
all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and start with</font>

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,150
what I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to keep things going</font>

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:20,490
but I'm kind of the key point here is

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,320
that DNS SEC adds some some challenges

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:27,150
adds a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of complexity to the</font>

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:31,350
DNS protocol and in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways can</font>

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:34,890
challenge the availability of DNS if not

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:37,340
configured properly and so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course it</font>

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,210
is a security retrofit and that's

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly that's some of the</font>

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,180
challenge that one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,489
makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it challenging and so the</font>

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,969
objectives in this or two first of all

15
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,739
establish a model for analyzing

16
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,989
availability in a DNS SEC deployment and

17
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:00,570
then look at different ways some of the

18
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,640
the ways the things that increased

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,709
complexity in a DNS SEC deployment that

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,860
may make a challenging particularly

21
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,509
challenging to to maintain and then talk

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,520
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple ways to mitigate the</font>

23
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:20,340
effects of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss configuration</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:23,280
there are three kind of classes of a DNS

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,810
SEC miss configuration I've outlined

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,250
them here and I'll just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,119
enumerate some of the ways so first of

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,740
all regarding what I call zone class

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,849
miss configurations and needs I call

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,589
them zone class because they're

31
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,240
basically contained within the zone

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,349
themselves and within this category

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,679
regarding signatures if the signatures

34
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:46,740
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> either missing expired or bogus in</font>

35
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:49,229
other words they don't match the record

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,679
data that they cover then of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course they</font>

37
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:56,310
are not helpful and that will cause a

38
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:57,840
break in the chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trust also if the</font>

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:03,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS keys are missing that are necessary</font>

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,280
to verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the signature then this is</font>

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:10,199
problematic and will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> result in a</font>

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,660
chain of trust so<font color="#E5E5E5"> again these are the</font>

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,069
endzone class misconfigurations you

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,290
might ask why the signatures might be

45
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,458
missing and there are couple possible

46
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,040
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this which I'll go into a</font>

47
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,710
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail later but missing</font>

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,640
signatures could be

49
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:27,740
because either the zone what they're

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,119
missing from the zone themselves for

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">some reason maybe the signer didn't</font>

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,290
include them properly or it could be

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the server the authoritative</font>

54
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,269

55

extra returning them in either case it's

56
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,220
it's a bad situation and likewise there

57
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">are cases where the there are server</font>

58
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:50,359
incompatibilities for not recognizing

00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns key resource record type so</font>

60
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,980
that's another item there and then

61
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,980
delegation class misconfigurations

62
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:01,429
extend beyond the zone itself and

63
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:04,399
basically refer to breaks in the chain

64
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,900
because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d s records and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">unsecure delegation and those are</font>

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,880
particularly important for insecure

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,550
delegations because the authoritative

79
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,609
server has to prove to the resolver that

80
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,810
there are no<font color="#E5E5E5"> D s resource records so</font>

81
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it knows that it's an insecure</font>

82
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,920
delegation and then trust anchor miss

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,530
configuration has to do with that's

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,350
really between the resolver and the and

85
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,700
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone which with which it's been</font>

86
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,989

87
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,170
much time on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this particular</font>

89
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,209
interesting things about failure with

regard to DNS segments configuration

91
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,660
that it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not cut and dry</font>

92
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:15,560
it's not always a<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero one type thing</font>

93
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,649
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly in our early deployment</font>

94
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,730
we would often<font color="#E5E5E5"> see cases where and the</font>

95
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,070
part of this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the way we</font>

96
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:26,300
deployed things but we would see<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

97
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:30,409
where a valid chain existed but in fact

98
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,430
there were also invalid paths or should

99
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,550
say there were

100
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,110
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this with a particular</font>

102
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,940
servers and so in my particular example

103
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,969
here what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is is a let's</font>

104
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">say we have this zone bar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calm where one</font>

of them is serving a data that is bogus

107
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,969
meaning again maybe there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS key</font>

108
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,100
missing from the resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> record set or</font>

109
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:01,040
that particular server is not serving

the resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> record signatures as it</font>

112
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,860
server here that's non-responsive well

113
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,320
if we consider only the responsive

114
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,330
servers because<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we should try and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">go to the next server if they don't get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a response however that may not</font>

117
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,160
necessarily be the case if they get an

invalid response invalid meaning data

119
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,140
wise then we consider those and we just

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,880
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fraction that's what we would</font>

123
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:37,460
particular zone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so looking at that</font>

124
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,020
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can be I should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention that</font>

this can be problematic for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

126
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,669
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons we have some pretty</font>

127
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,370
small smart resolvers out there doing

128
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:50,210
validation and I know bind and I believe

129
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:53,120
unbound as well we'll try other servers

130
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,669
if it gets an invalid result from from

131
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,460
one of them which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good but there are</font>

132
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:03,020
certain cases where that may not help

133
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:05,380
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those is if if you for example</font>

134
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,120
are behind a non if you're validating

135
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,460
resolver is behind a non validating cash

136
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,710
than you really are at the whim of what

137
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,169
is in the upstream cash if if that makes

138
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,609
sense you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the you</font>

139
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,470
can't try your next authoritative server

140
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,430
because you're forced to what's used in

141
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that non valley in cash and and or that</font>

142
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that cash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe validating but isn't as</font>

143
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,360
smart as one of these other validators

144
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,360
for example there may be also cases

145
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,470
where well the other prime example is

146
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,360
you may have some of your servers

147
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,030
working and so everything seems fine but

148
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,970
now you lose your redundancy both in

149
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,010
terms of failover and load balancing so

150
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,770
this can be problematic if your servers

151
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,909
aren't doing well

152
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,919
if they aren't consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should say</font>

153
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so we can take this notion of failure</font>

154
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:57,448
potential and just extend it to all the

155
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:59,340
zones in the hierarchy basically by and

156
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,930
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this essentially does it says okay</font>

157
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,299
what's 1 minus probability that you're

158
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:07,860
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting that you're not having any</font>

159
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,780
problems in any of your zones and so

160
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,849
using that model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of what</font>

161
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing for on each zone which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

162
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you in this analysis in just a</font>

163
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:26,549
moment this is what we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> calculate</font>

164
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:31,770
this oh these are really old slides

165
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,180
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knot I had a</font>

166
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,770
more recent survey that actually covered

167
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,819
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a five month period and the</font>

168
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,500
results were slightly more interesting

169
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I had it broken down by arrow type</font>

170
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,080
so I apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not having that but</font>

171
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,490
so this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a smaller polling</font>

172
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,050
period that I did over a six-week period

173
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,460
with about 1,500 zones that I considered

174
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:55,710
production signed and what I mean by

175
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:57,318
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they they had a chain or it</font>

176
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,380
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be chained if it was broken</font>

177
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:04,139
extending from that zone to either is CS

178
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,539
deal v service or the root zone after

179
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:13,340
the signing of the root zone in<font color="#CCCCCC"> July and</font>

180
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:20,389
what we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this subset of</font>

181
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:22,409
zones that we analyzed we had about 194

182
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,840
misconfigurations that resulted<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

183
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:30,029
certain failure meaning the failure

184
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,919
potential was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and out of this</font>

185
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,659
we had to say about<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty nine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

186
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,140
of those where's own class<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss</font>

187
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">configurations and delegation customs</font>

188
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:45,990
configurations again this has to do with

189
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:47,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> either something that excuse me the</font>

190
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,430
delegation class misconfigurations have

191
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:53,459
to do with a deus mismatch with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

192
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,630
keys in the in the child's own those

193
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,670
accounted for about thirty one percent

194
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,689
miss configurations that resulted in in

195
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,579
a failure potential of one and then this

196
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,720
bottom number has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do have some</font>

197
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,180
pertinence to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about</font>

198
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later but this basically is</font>

199
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,380
if it had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with some kind of</font>

200
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with something above the zone</font>

201
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,260
itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so wasn't necessarily the</font>

202
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,720
fault of the zone i should say it's

203
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,910
about thirty one percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

204
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,690
so here's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a graph that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shows the</font>

205
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:28,719
failure potential this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an average for</font>

206
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:33,340
for all the zones over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> six-week</font>

207
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,590
period that we analyzed them and so the

208
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing was there was about twelve</font>

209
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,550
percent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had an average failure</font>

210
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:42,040
potential of zero the bad news is that

211
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">we had about two percent that never left</font>

212
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,459
the ground during<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time that we had</font>

213
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,720
at meaning they had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the entire</font>

214
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,990
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were under our watch</font>

215
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,190
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> this polling period so pretty</font>

216
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:56,260
interesting results so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing</font>

217
00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:00,400
we asked is what are some of the

218
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions we might ask in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of why</font>

219
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,439
what makes things<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult for for DNS</font>

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,730
SEC deployment but if we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at in</font>

221
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,310
terms of this failure potential we're

222
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,930
looking at the really the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number the</font>

223
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,000
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we came up with calculated</font>

224
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,010
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> calculated from two different</font>

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,350
perspectives and one of those was the

226
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,700
horizontal perspective looking at the

227
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,310
authoritative servers and the

228
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,470
consistency among those servers and then

229
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,140
there was the ancestry of the zone and

230
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,490
so looking at kind of a vertical

231
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,380
perspective and so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

232
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,810
complexity at those two different areas

233
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">and see how we can simplify things these</font>

234
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,530
are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions we were asking</font>

235
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,449
so so we call these hierarchical

236
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:40,839
complexity and administrative complexity

237
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:43,600
and hierarchical reduction potential we

238
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,850
asked ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if the ancestry of</font>

239
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,590
a zone might reasonably consolidate it

240
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,230
be consolidated meaning if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were to</font>

241
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,880
take your sub domain space and of a

242
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,030
delegated zone and then move it up into

243
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,060
its parent zone preserving the original

244
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,360
name space but just consolidating the

245
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,810
zones what might that reduction be so in

246
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,499
our example here taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 to 3 is a</font>

247
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,779
reduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 point 25</font>

248
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:12,129
ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then administrative complexity is</font>

249
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:15,469
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the organizations that</font>

250
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:17,899
are are hosting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server's</font>

251
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:21,319
authoritative for a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> zone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

252
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:24,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean to say in both of</font>

253
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:26,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples that having a large</font>

254
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:28,189
ancestry is necessarily bad or that

255
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:31,999
having other people host your

256
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:34,309
authoritative data is bad but there

257
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:37,279
there are certainly some concerns with

258
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:39,319
that only<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you don't necessarily</font>

259
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,199
have control over what they're doing and

260
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:43,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">this means both in terms of what level</font>

261
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:46,699
of DNS SEC they're supporting on their

262
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:48,199
servers they may unilaterally make a

263
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,549
change on their firewall and all of a

264
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:51,199
sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not getting zone updates</font>

265
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:53,509
and so your signatures are going to

266
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:55,488
expire these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the concerns</font>

267
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,809
that you can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across by having</font>

268
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:58,929
somebody else host your data that you

269
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:00,949
just need to be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and of course</font>

270
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,108
monitoring can help with some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this by</font>

271
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:05,508
looking at all the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

272
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:06,919
authoritative for your zones but but

273
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,199
anyway the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that we</font>

274
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,689
calculated<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular metric is</font>

275
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:14,839
simply by taking a putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your</font>

276
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:19,519
servers in a hat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling two of them</font>

277
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,929
out at random<font color="#E5E5E5"> with replacement and in</font>

278
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,389
calculating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the probability that you</font>

279
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:25,399
would get two distinct organizations

280
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:27,739
selected from this hat so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

281
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,659
digging a single number basically that

282
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:32,029
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of represented the distribution and</font>

283
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:35,059
so that's what that's what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and</font>

284
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:36,739
so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the not sure how well</font>

285
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,919
these you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see them better on those</font>

286
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:42,049
screens but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the way this</font>

287
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:47,720
turned out for hierarchical reduction

288
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:49,399
potential in in a so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at all</font>

289
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,639
zones was about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think eight million</font>

292
00:12:56,049 --> 00:13:01,159

similarly with administrative complexity

299
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:20,250
we see a similar type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pattern here</font>

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,380
and again what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this represents is the</font>

314
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:06,900
excuse me there are several ways that

315
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,150
this can be avoided in first is

316
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,709
following the best practice operational

317
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,980
standards which are documented in the

318
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:17,790
rfcs for example key role<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

319
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:21,990
procedures RFC that's RFC 4641 is going

320
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:24,719
over a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a revision but also the trust</font>

321
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,120
anchor rollover procedures and that's in

322
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,430
RFC 50 11 and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's also this</font>

323
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,410
notion that I alluded<font color="#E5E5E5"> to earlier which I</font>

324
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:34,260
I call validation diligence and that

325
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,480
means keep trying to you the other

326
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,069
authoritative servers if you get it

327
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">right that's another method to try and</font>

328
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,240
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but then the idea is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a one of</font>

329
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,630
the challenges might be where can you

330
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,970
find optimality with that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it</font>

331
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,080
might be a you could have problems where

332
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,510
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a symptom of something</font>

333
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,029
larger so it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know when you</font>

334
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,770
have these these inconsistencies even if

335
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:57,600
a validator can find its way<font color="#CCCCCC"> around it</font>

336
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:02,130
maybe it's a symptom of something larger

337
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:06,330
that's coming around<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so one other</font>

338
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:07,830
idea that we've come up with to mitigate

339
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,680
some of this configuration as an idea

340
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,420
called what we call soft anchoring and

341
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,930
the principle<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind is that DNS keys</font>

342
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,810
typically don't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> too often maybe</font>

343
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:22,589
your z sk rollovers are happening

344
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:25,859
perhaps monthly<font color="#CCCCCC"> KSK rollovers maybe</font>

345
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:30,420
yearly something like that but but

346
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:33,630
they're not changing too often and so

347
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,149
if we take resolvers and we and the

348
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,450
trust anchors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they typically use</font>

349
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:41,010
which we refer to as a hard anchor and

350
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,160
then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hard anchor we derive</font>

351
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:47,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we call soft anchors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from those and</font>

352
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:51,719
those are DNS keys further down in the

353
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,339
ancestry that are authenticated from

354
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,649
existing hard anchors using the chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

355
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,720
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so in the diagram here you can</font>

356
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,730
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resolver has its trust</font>

357
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,769
anchor at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root but has also learned</font>

358
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,779
what we call these soft anchors further

359
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">down and the idea behind this is that if</font>

360
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,130
for some reason there's a break in the

361
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:11,100
chain such as this break in the between

362
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:15,149
calm and bar calm because of a bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> KSK</font>

363
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:18,930
roll over if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your resolver has</font>

364
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:24,540
maintained this soft anchor learned and

365
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:26,339
maintained this then it can now be it's

366
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to be inhibited by zone class</font>

367
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:31,079
misconfigurations above where that's

368
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:32,459
anchored and also delegation class

369
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:37,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">misconfigurations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this particular</font>

370
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:40,589
example so some of the logistics for

371
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,649
this it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it</font>

372
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:45,060
follows RFC 50 11 in a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

373
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:49,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference is that you really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

374
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:51,359
to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the zones for which</font>

375
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:54,209
you're maintaining keys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

376
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,680
following RFC 50 11 because RFC 50 11

377
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:57,599
was designed for people that are

378
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,269
explicitly following trust anchors and

379
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,339
watching the rollovers and most zones

380
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:06,809
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that need because they're not</font>

381
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:09,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root and so people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

382
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:14,099
need to be anchoring at places below the

383
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,290
root and so so in principle what's

384
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:19,770
happening is the resolvers periodically

385
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:23,129
pulling this the soft anchor zone and

386
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:25,619
then soft anchors are added when it

387
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,169
notices that new dns key show up in the

388
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:33,809
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> record set and persist for some</font>

particular hold down period or excuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

390
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:39,299
if or if there's if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns key exists</font>

391
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,129
and shows up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's also a</font>

394
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:48,870
indicator that this is a

395
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,850
this is a reasonable DNS kita to add to

396
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,639
as a soft anchor and then for soft

397

anchor removal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have there are three</font>

could be removed that is if the

416
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,490
any help in that particular case because

<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't have a trust anchor below that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at that</font>

432
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,440
particularly we look at this as

433
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,690
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be helpful as dns</font>

434
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:42,150
deployment gains ground and you have an

435
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:44,400
issue such as a resource record excuse

436
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,050
me a signature that<font color="#CCCCCC"> expires at the top</font>

437
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,660
level domain which has happened several

438
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,000
times in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

439
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,820
have zone sign behind that and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

440
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,620
people actually validating excuse me you

441
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,240
have zone signed below that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have</font>

442
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,919
people actually validating that then you

443
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,920
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

444
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,330
to you don't want to have 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> calls from</font>

445
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,580
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers saying why did this go</font>

446
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,290
down and what can you do and so you're

447
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,060
forced to turn off<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS SEC validation</font>

448
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:11,090
because of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those are those</font>

449
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:15,230
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the ideas behind this okay</font>

450
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:17,000
so just in summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS responses we're</font>

451
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to achieve not only accuracy and</font>

452
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,220
truth and our DNS responses but also

453
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,190
availability some<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful considerations</font>

454
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,110
in DNS SEC deployment and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally</font>

455
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,020
soft anchoring is one of the techniques

456
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've introduced to mitigate the</font>

458
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,830
are a couple acknowledgments of people

the registry for org can't seem to

477
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,220
big a problem we going to see between

478
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,140
registrar's and registries particularly

479
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,610
since the one I'm using<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a registrar</font>

480
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,350
is one of the largest registries out

481
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,580
there and they still can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to quite</font>

482
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,320
figure out how to make the system work

483
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,330
and I will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for this particular</font>

484

registrar we are prototype they're

experimenting with us it is not

486
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,210
something they're providing the public

487
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,159
in general that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

488
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">and unfortunately I'm not sure I have</font>

489
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,240
the expertise to answer that because I

490
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:58,540
haven't dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot with actually the</font>

that I'm in the process of trying to

493
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,190
transfer that to someone because my

494
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,170
registrar currently doesn't even accept

495
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:10,060
to DNS SEC I'm not sure they know what

496
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is I feared that might be the case</font>

gov obviously is run by a totally

different group of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people yes I also</font>

499
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,379
haven't had some issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

500

but it's been working for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while at</font>

501

least and I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had any serious</font>

506
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:40,510
not and do not plan to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do RFC 50 11 at</font>

507
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,490
any time ever they say that it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

508
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,250
appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be something that is amenable</font>

509
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,900
to their business plan and it just isn't

510
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,030
going to happen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys are going to</font>

have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be submitted manually as far as</font>

512
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:54,049
they're concerned forever is there any

513
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,139
reasonable resolution for this

514
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:59,570
it strikes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me invitation for breakage if</font>

515
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:01,590
everything always has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by hand</font>

520
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:18,090
place RFC 50 11 from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parents own</font>

521
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:22,320
perspective to look at the changing keys

522
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:23,580
to their child zones or not and whether

523
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,139
that's something you're using or if

<font color="#E5E5E5">they're other things in the works to be</font>

526
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,879
the only ones i've talked to have a

527
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,019
solution in the works at all have been

528
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,908
just you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to a web page</font>

529
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:39,110
you put your new des record in before

530
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:41,940
your old expires and sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

531
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,709
have had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us with some of the</font>

532
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,519
other prototype systems but they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

533
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as they're concerned</font>

534
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,850
that's their final solution they're not

535
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:51,929
planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> on implementing any automated</font>

536
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:53,699
system whatever at any time I question

537
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:54,990
that with them and I appears that you

538
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,450
weren't aware of that situation either

539
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,429
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if there's a specific</font>

540
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,129
technical reason that they seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be so</font>

541
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:04,620
consistently saying we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font>

542
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,230
in doing that or not early baffled by

543
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,879
eventually yeah so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually came up</font>

544
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">at a meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was at at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oreck</font>

545
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:16,469
meeting in October and one of the folks

546
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:18,120
there that that addressed this and I

547
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the perspective was correct that</font>

548
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">they were addressing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from a</font>

549
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:24,509
perspective of resolvers using trust

550
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:27,199
anchors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think from that</font>

551
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:29,070
perspective you wouldn't expect any

552
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,590
especially with the signing of the route

553
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,000
you wouldn't expect resolvers to be

554
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,009
using trust anchors other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the route</font>

555
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,779
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exception perhaps of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal these</font>

556
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:39,149
services as well they continue to exist

557
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:42,929
and because you would expect everything

558
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:47,189
to be done at that level absolutely

559
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:48,750
right and and so and so anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

560
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,279
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a they would consider extra</font>

561
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,179
overhead<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that perspective now if</font>

562
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,909
you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from a perspective</font>

563
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:56,820
of key rollovers there might be a

564
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:59,669
different perspective and someone else

565
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,649
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a better source in terms of</font>

566
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:04,049
what's gone on in the community in terms

567
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:05,250
of standards for that for automated

568
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,500
rollovers but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I personally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

569
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:13,110
there needs to be something

570
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:16,600
less manual but but what's the word

571
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,299
accurate when performing these key

572
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,428
rollovers between parent and child it's

573
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:24,009
clear that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> registrar registry issues</font>

574
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:28,200
are going to take a while to iron out

575
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:32,380
and particularly the case of register

576
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,750
registrar transfers may take a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

577
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,539
long to straighten out but I think

578
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:40,149
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue of why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should i do</font>

579
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:44,350
something I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not being paid for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

580
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:46,178
see a solution unfortunately and and by

581
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,959
the way I know you were you were talking

582
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:49,240
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a little bit during</font>

583
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,129
respective but the idea behind the soft

584
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,929
anchoring notion that i presented here

585
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:59,039
was that not depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the zones that</font>

586
00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:04,149
it was monitoring to implement RFC 50 11

587
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:06,669
hey sean from mozilla oh yeah the graphs

588
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:09,549
you showed us over what period of time

589
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:12,690
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data collected let's see this</font>

590
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:17,830
was a long time ago I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was</font>

591
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:21,610
these particular graphs were started in

592
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:25,689
May no I think it's june and july of

593
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:29,080
last year okay I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bo Blanco continue</font>

594
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:31,840
looking at this over yeah I've been

595
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,250
monitoring it since<font color="#E5E5E5"> then and in fact I</font>

596
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">just in got a couple weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago started a</font>

597
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:40,750
different monitoring system which was a

598
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:43,299
little bit better it was keeping actual

599
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,399
raw data instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of pseudo data</font>

600
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,980
that I was before and so I actually had

601
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:50,199
some different results to present here

602
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,549
for about a five month period probably

603
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">have been longer except for some</font>

604
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:57,070
technical logistics but but yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am i</font>

605
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:59,639
am recording data for other zones one

606
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:05,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">limitation i have is i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

607
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:07,299
diversity of what i wanna say maybe as a

608
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:11,860
diverse set of data as some other

609
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:13,480
sources do at this point okay and do you

610
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:16,809
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an adoption today</font>

618
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:34,419
little bit more diverse in terms of

619
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:36,610
looking at widespread you know who's

620
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,559
deploying it mine was more looking at a

621
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:42,399
sub most of my data to be honest came

622
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:45,639
from resolvers names that were being

623
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,620
resolved in different places I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

624
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:51,070
those as my basis because I knew they're

625
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:54,250
actually being used and some other

626
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,840
different sources but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

627
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:00,270
widespread deployment I'd probably point

628
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,678
you to sex fighters one and I can't

629
