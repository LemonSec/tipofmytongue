00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,480
hi

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,519
everybody in nanogland i'm uh thrilled

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,960
and honored

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,040
to give a talk at this nanag 80.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,080
um first i'll give a little bit of

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,359
background on myself

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,198
my name is avi friedman i started

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,000
not quite in the dawn of networking like

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,439
some nog folks but in 1992 i started an

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
internet provider

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,160
coming from education and not finding a

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,280
way to buy dial-up access

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,920
got into the inter-networking space

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,360
was fascinated with that uh went to work

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,079
at abovenet

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,000
as engineering lead at the global

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,079
backbone and hosting company

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,320
got really fascinated by akamai which

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,000
was as someone said the world's largest

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,960
non-network at the time uh after akamai

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
was cpu of a cloud company also running

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,399
infrastructure

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,199
on the side and saw a lot of gaps in the

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,879
industry around

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
analytics and where things were going

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,479
with telemetry and started kentec

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,640
uh to resolve that um i'm thrilled to be

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,200
talking to everyone here today

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
i wanted to share my thoughts about

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,799
what's great

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,679
uh what some of our challenges are in

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,040
terms of

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,960
uh our industry how we perceive ways

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,320
that we can improve things that are

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,199
coming down uh

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,240
down the pike and i hope it is helpful

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,479
to people and

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,399
i will uh take questions at the end

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,240
so first before i get into the meat of

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,520
it i just

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,119
want to say um i we all know

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
what a difficult year it's been this

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,399
year but

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,399
i think there's been an increasing

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,280
awareness of how critical the nanak

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,000
community

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,119
and internetworking in general is and

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,040
i'd like to thank you

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,520
um i know that as i talk to people uh

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,520
the the the prominence of networking and

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,320
of inter-networking has uh

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,719
has has really gone up over the last few

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,158
years uh hopefully next year and beyond

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,479
will be much calmer

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,119
but uh will continue to make the digital

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,160
world go

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,120
so where are we in the world today

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,599
um as i said people are are realizing

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,080
that if

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,000
zoom doesn't work if the network doesn't

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,360
work if people can't be connected then

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,800
business can't go and even

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,160
education and life can't go and

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
that's good applications that people are

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,959
using

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,839
are increasingly the glue that connects

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,360
people and

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,040
they run on networks bandwidth is going

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
up and up and we were very fortunate

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,679
thank you everybody

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
that we started the year over

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,280
provisioned um and so far

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,200
the supply chain has been holding um uh

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
and the internet has been growing uh

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
with maybe the number of micro outages

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,000
that you would expect

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,400
and as uh as one of my friends says

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
uh networks are the water of the clouds

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,200
or without the network

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,120
there is no cloud um and networking has

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,359
gotten more complex there's underlying

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,360
overlay and tunnels and 20 different

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
ways of connecting things

85
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
but ultimately someone needs to

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,519
understand all the parts and actually

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,879
make it all work

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,400
connectivity is exploding

89
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,000
there's a lot of hype around this but

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
there's also a lot of reality

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,040
just the diversity of interconnection um

92
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,079
is

93
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,519
is growing as well as the importance and

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,799
there's more layers um more things debug

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,360
more interrelationships and in some

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,840
sense fewer people being

97
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,560
we think of being born growing that

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
understand

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,200
all the different layers and as folks

100
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,720
that are on the operational side or have

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,798
peers that are understand

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
there's a lot of hair on fire people are

103
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,519
on the front line

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,280
there's issues with the network there's

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,879
issues everywhere

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,720
and competing projects and

107
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,798
again it's it can often be a thankless

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,599
job but um

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,640
but it's an important one so what's the

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,518
outsider view

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,798
um you know we see ourselves uh we come

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
together at

113
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
i've been to dozens of nanogs we have

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,518
the hallway track we share

115
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,639
information we evolve technology

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,399
the outsider view in some sense is

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,239
networking's going away this is all

118
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,440
virtual it's api calls

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:26,560
it's it's i make a request

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,479
things come into play and i hear

121
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,320
the vendors talking about self-driving

122
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,000
networks isn't you know what is it that

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,280
you folks actually do

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,960
and i think that we as a community um

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,799
both have a little bit of a marketing

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,039
problem and i think that as

127
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,440
infrastructure sophistication grows and

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
application sophistication grows

129
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,360
the operational teams will get more

130
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,440
sophisticated and actually

131
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,360
start working together more closely and

132
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
try to have greater understanding

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,360
i think that will help with some of the

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,400
outsider view but i also think that we

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
as a community

136
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,919
could be doing a better job speaking a

137
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
little bit less in jargon

138
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,680
and trying to help build bridges to

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,919
other operational groups

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,039
a quick review about where we've been

141
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,120
and this is

142
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,520
a little bias towards my background and

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,320
that of a lot of folks that i know

144
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,758
in nanag in ripe and similar communities

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,320
a lot of us started as

146
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,160
hobbyists um people that were going to

147
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,639
use computers no matter what got

148
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,039
really interested in connectivity and

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,240
connections from other areas of

150
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,199
either a hobby or professional computer

151
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
i.t

152
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,560
involvement and one of the things that's

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,919
been great that i still see culturally

154
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
in

155
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,799
hundreds of networks that i work with is

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
if you're willing to get out there on

157
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
the front line and do

158
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,639
work if you have bright shiny eyes

159
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,080
people will recognize that and there's a

160
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,160
ton of opportunity

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,198
um what is great but also a challenge is

162
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,199
that what you need

163
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
to run modern networks is a little bit

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
of a mix of

165
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
what we call book knowledge things you

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
can get online

167
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,520
classes and tribal knowledge um

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,319
apprenticeship with

169
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,479
a little bit of breaking things um and

170
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
how to replicate the tribal knowledge

171
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,599
and how to replicate breaking things

172
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,120
without breaking

173
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,280
an increasingly critical digital

174
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,560
infrastructure the network underneath

175
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,039
those are things that i think we need to

176
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,759
think about and work on a little bit

177
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,120
um i have this meme here it is known

178
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,360
from game of thrones

179
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,160
there is a little bit of that and i'd

180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
like to see us

181
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
figure out as a community how we can

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,840
break out of that

183
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,080
uh don't use as7007 uh don't use route

184
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,479
redistribution

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
things that are known um read the

186
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,080
release notes before you decide whether

187
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,318
you want to install an operating system

188
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,080
things you don't get from book knowledge

189
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
but things that we know and communicate

190
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,080
to each other whether it's in a job

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
or as i said in a nanog or other

192
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
conference hallway track where people

193
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,960
are

194
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
teaching each other and and exchanging

195
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,758
tips

196
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
um especially in a coveted and

197
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,800
increasingly remote world

198
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,758
uh this is something that we need to

199
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
work on um one thing i think is really

200
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,479
amazing

201
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,560
is that you often get to reason from

202
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,758
first principles and you often need to

203
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,479
because we find bugs um

204
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,240
your average sre is not going to find a

205
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,479
criminal bug in an average year

206
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
and your average network practitioner

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,159
will find a bug

208
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,400
i think that's really great um but it

209
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,960
does require a certain mindset

210
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,239
and it requires the that we lay these

211
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,080
things out what are those first

212
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,120
principles especially in a more complex

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,120
environment

214
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,400
um and so from the outside it can seem

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
simple um

216
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,318
but the reality um and not even really

217
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,199
getting into the politics of

218
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,759
interconnection

219
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,440
can be more complex although the

220
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,319
politics of interconnection is another

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,840
area where

222
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,680
there are a lot of things that are known

223
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,359
that are hard to pick up for people that

224
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,919
want to get into our industry

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
um so the big question i have is how do

226
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,080
we

227
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,080
scale this and i've got some thoughts on

228
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,240
this later in the talk

229
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,240
so i think of it as the greatness and

230
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,160
the challenges that we have or the angst

231
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
and the ah or the on the angst and and

232
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,639
what's the awe

233
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,680
well um when people in

234
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,000
uh uber drivers ask me what i do i say

235
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
i make the internet go my company powers

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
the people that make the internet go and

237
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,120
people go oh that's that's really nice

238
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
now

239
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,400
now can you help me with my driver app

240
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,599
and i have to explain that's not what

241
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,638
it's about

242
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,878
but i really appreciate

243
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,800
i think a lot of our friends co-workers

244
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,599
and families really appreciate

245
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,319
what we do at a high level but i'd also

246
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,519
like to

247
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,200
celebrate that we actually run probably

248
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,719
the largest distributed system out there

249
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,560
we can have a debate with

250
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,000
with microsoft google facebook and

251
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,000
others but in some

252
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
sense we've got a distributed computing

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
system that connects the world and i

254
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,320
think that's pretty amazing

255
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,040
um it is very resilient um

256
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,800
i am more amazed uh that it that it

257
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,279
works as well as it does in some ways

258
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,160
than

259
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,439
that we do have failures um and there's

260
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,199
a pretty cool article

261
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,959
uh by the atlantic that i encourage you

262
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,360
to see uh and uh

263
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,239
take a look at if uh if you're curious

264
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,800
for a more artistic take on our industry

265
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,279
so what are some of the challenges that

266
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,519
offset

267
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,480
the aw and and the and the joy of what

268
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,760
we do

269
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,959
um well i mentioned in some ways

270
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,040
there are uh silos and segmentations in

271
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,199
operation groups across companies and

272
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,399
networking can often be a different silo

273
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,080
and that becomes a problem because

274
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,080
we've got different tools and knowledge

275
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,279
than other groups and i think that this

276
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,480
is a challenge

277
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,800
that other groups are aware of too and

278
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,080
we

279
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,439
and they can be working at over the next

280
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,440
years to help

281
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
bring these things together as

282
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,399
applications or provisioning network and

283
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,240
network needs to be

284
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,760
application aware another challenge is a

285
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,080
lot of us come from

286
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,519
a world where we understand these first

287
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
principles but there is a lot of

288
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
evolution and

289
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,000
we can do a lot without really

290
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,680
understanding some of the things that

291
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,800
set on top of the network

292
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,680
and some of that is in terms of cloud

293
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,120
um and i've seen a lot of this siloing

294
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,239
where you've got different groups that

295
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
deal with different parts of the

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
infrastructure

297
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,800
but one of the points um that i'd like

298
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,720
to to make

299
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,399
in this talk is that cloud is something

300
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,640
that we need to be aware of

301
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,839
and the other is around telemetry um

302
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
it's something that i focus on

303
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,920
professionally now

304
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,279
but we've got some gaps in having a

305
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,519
taxonomy

306
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,959
teaching people having consistent ways

307
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,160
of getting it having consistent

308
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,399
ways of dealing with it and

309
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,079
understanding uh what generally what we

310
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,040
do with telemetry to make infrastructure

311
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,560
go

312
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,160
another is with um automation um this is

313
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,079
both a hype thing and something that

314
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,120
we've all done since the 90s

315
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,359
and it's something that we're all

316
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,040
actively working on now and

317
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,320
this is a little bit of a challenge and

318
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,319
the people on the outside sometimes even

319
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,079
inside our own companies don't realize

320
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
that automation does not mean simplicity

321
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,399
especially in terms of operation when we

322
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,440
actually need to make all this go

323
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,360
um buzz and hype i believe

324
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,920
that there's a ton of wasted time that

325
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,320
could be

326
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,599
spent in forward motion in our industry

327
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
and that

328
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
we should try to at least make sure that

329
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,440
separate

330
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,560
from the architecture we actually have a

331
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
curated

332
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,319
space of plain speak an example i'll

333
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
give you is

334
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,959
five or six years ago when i was trying

335
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,720
to understand what is all this fabric

336
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,399
networking and each vendor

337
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
and it was clear to me even though i

338
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,920
understood the principles of all the

339
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,199
things that it could possibly be

340
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
that it was going to take me many

341
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,680
meetings with multiple vendors to figure

342
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,000
it out

343
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,079
and i talked with a friend of mine and

344
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,920
he said this is this and this is that

345
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,800
and this is that in one sentence and i

346
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,040
understood

347
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,359
um this happens over and over again that

348
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,680
i think we get in the way of teaching

349
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
uh by not having a parallel path versus

350
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,199
the hype

351
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,000
and this is something that we've been

352
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,120
talking and thinking

353
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,160
about before 2020 uh but is even

354
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,160
um increased in sensitivity is really

355
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,079
getting a more diverse community and

356
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,519
there are some communities like the

357
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,160
peering community that may be a little

358
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,560
bit more

359
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,000
diverse than the engineering and

360
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,560
architecture community

361
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,760
but even so there's a long way to go to

362
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,199
match even

363
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,680
early career levels of diversity and

364
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,880
i think related to one of the challenges

365
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,399
is how do we attract the next

366
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
generations and the world is very

367
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,720
logical

368
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,959
how do we get people who are really

369
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,079
interested in making it all work and

370
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,599
seeing the engines

371
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,399
of the networking turn and building

372
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
operating debugging and scaling so yeah

373
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,160
you know

374
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,199
mandatory meme um why is it the network

375
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,000
is it the network

376
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
um how do these groups come together um

377
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,959
how do we explain our value and how do

378
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,000
we grow those are things that i think

379
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,000
about a lot

380
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,800
um so where are we going what's going on

381
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,680
what are we hearing about well cloud as

382
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,319
i mentioned

383
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,040
um in some sense there's a lot of cloud

384
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,800
washing

385
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
people think that there's no to the

386
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,519
extent that people think there's nothing

387
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
underneath the cloud

388
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,600
but on the other hand it is a critical

389
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,279
part of how people are deploying

390
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,920
workloads and something that

391
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,600
networking and internet working needs to

392
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,120
become even more familiar with

393
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,000
especially as we think about

394
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,040
telemetry analytics monitoring

395
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,880
automation

396
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,360
which is something that as i said in

397
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,320
many ways networkers have been ahead of

398
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,200
um but the buzz and hype cycle has

399
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,120
really

400
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
led many people to think they're behind

401
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,880
when in fact this is a journey um

402
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,760
that we're all on streaming telemetry

403
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,639
there's a lot of energy around this

404
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,120
which is great

405
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,120
but also a lot of hype about what the

406
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
current state is and a lot of work that

407
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,480
we

408
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,480
still have to do

409
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,880
mlai related to automation related to

410
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,920
telemetry

411
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,839
um the network engineers can go home the

412
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,680
network is going to be self-driving it's

413
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,360
automatically learning things

414
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,199
um i'll talk a little bit about that

415
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,000
what i think the truth is here

416
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,719
um and the the uh bringing it all

417
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,160
together

418
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,199
self-driving closed-loop networks great

419
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,760
aspiration but this is not where we are

420
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,399
today

421
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,439
um despite some of the marketing uh that

422
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,480
we see

423
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,680
so my take on the reality

424
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,160
automation is real but really

425
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,120
being focused on specific kinds of

426
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,240
networks

427
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,000
use cases workflows and i think that's

428
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,800
awesome but sometimes the noise can get

429
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,040
in the way of

430
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,839
us making progress on this and i would

431
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,040
love to see

432
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,920
more sharing of the success stories here

433
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,760
there was a great tutorial about turnip

434
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,479
automation

435
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:52,480
at nanog i'd love to see more of that

436
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,160
and more sharing of our journey on

437
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
automation

438
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,719
aiml definitely has applications can

439
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,199
definitely be unleashed

440
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,760
on network data network telemetry

441
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:07,120
network topology

442
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,480
configs the entire breadth of of

443
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,440
our world and can actually drive

444
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,079
into automation but there's no one that

445
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,160
i've seen

446
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,920
that has this self-driving network with

447
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,560
the network automatically adapting and

448
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,040
learning

449
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,239
and even basic things like take

450
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
streaming to lavatory

451
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
put it in a data lake and magically get

452
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,719
the observations out

453
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,519
is bleeding edge and again i'd love to

454
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,839
see

455
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,040
some talks about the challenges that

456
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,040
people are still having there

457
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,759
and sharing around that cloud is real

458
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,240
and i think sometimes we get cynical

459
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,839
about

460
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,240
people that think that there is no

461
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,639
network under cloud but

462
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,920
it is something that i've seen a broad

463
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
need for education

464
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,000
about and it is all knowable all the

465
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
things underneath it are things

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,360
which we as a community are already

467
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,959
familiar with but

468
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,360
if we're really going to help with

469
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,518
end-to-end debugging for our customers

470
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
whether they're internal or external i

471
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,880
think that this is something that

472
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,560
we need to do a little bit more with

473
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,839
education and translation

474
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,160
about um just as networkers have

475
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,920
issues sometimes explaining their world

476
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,959
i think cloud people do too and

477
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,360
would love to see see a bridge and so

478
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,680
streaming telemetry as i mentioned

479
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,040
i think it's awesome we have a lot of

480
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
customers that are using it it's

481
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,279
something that

482
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,399
we unify with snmp and and and correlate

483
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,199
with other sources

484
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,120
but there's a promise that it is the

485
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,359
only thing that you need

486
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
and what we've seen is that's not the

487
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
case i think

488
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,519
um there's a lot of evolution there's a

489
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
lot in the nano

490
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,639
community sometimes we think about the

491
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,040
world as

492
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
four leading vendors and the real world

493
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,000
that

494
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,959
i see is a little bit more complex and i

495
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
think that

496
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,399
we need to bring the benefits of

497
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,399
streaming

498
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,440
and additional kinds of telemetry and

499
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,320
open config

500
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,279
and find a way to unify that with a more

501
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,400
diverse

502
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,039
technological world that's out there

503
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,480
and also talk about what we're actually

504
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,480
doing today

505
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,559
there are a lot of use cases that i

506
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
think are part of the hype cycle

507
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,918
and would love to see continued

508
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,520
education around that

509
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,039
what do we do after we take streaming

510
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,359
telemetry and and

511
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,199
and capture it and what use cases are we

512
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,319
bringing out of that

513
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,760
so i will get to some things that i

514
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,678
think about that we can do

515
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,120
as a community as individuals but first

516
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,080
i'll give you my take on

517
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,520
where i think we are going um and

518
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,639
processing the hype

519
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,280
uh first absolutely telemetry and ai are

520
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,840
already helping um even though we don't

521
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
have

522
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,159
complete closed-loop self-driving

523
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,719
networks i work with uh

524
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
hundreds of networks that have major

525
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,520
parts of

526
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,160
automation telemetry impacting things ai

527
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,480
bringing the insights that do even some

528
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,559
closed-loop functions

529
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,000
i do think specific operational patterns

530
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,960
will be automated i don't think we're

531
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,280
going to see

532
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,480
every single kind of thing that is a

533
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
service

534
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,640
being completely automated um and i

535
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,240
think it's critical that

536
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,919
we understand how to uh communicate

537
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,679
document those patterns that's a gap

538
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,919
that i've seen where

539
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,840
as i said automation does not mean

540
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,400
simplicity russ white told me that and i

541
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,480
don't know

542
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,080
whether that's his original quote or not

543
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,919
but um

544
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,360
we as the reasoners from first

545
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,080
principles will still have to make all

546
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,000
that go

547
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,360
but i expect to continue to see and i'm

548
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,600
seeing in my customers

549
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
things like scaling up infrastructure

550
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,639
doing cdn load balancing

551
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,678
of course ddos defense um provisioning

552
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,160
um but the entire loop of

553
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,360
everything out to robots maintaining

554
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,559
hardware

555
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,080
still works in progress i do think

556
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,240
that security and operational tooling

557
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,600
would converge i do think orchestration

558
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,760
as part of automation

559
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,439
is going to drive that because if the

560
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,400
security folks don't know what's being

561
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,840
orchestrated

562
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,440
they're going to waste a lot of time and

563
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
if the operations folks don't know

564
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,799
what's being

565
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,480
shut down or suspicious then they're

566
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,240
going to waste time investigating

567
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,520
outages this is not the culture we're in

568
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,919
today but i do think

569
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,720
that it is um going the situation will

570
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,720
improve

571
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,000
um i do also think that operations

572
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,840
groups will come together

573
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,520
i think we have some responsibility but

574
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,199
also the other groups do it's something

575
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,320
that i focus a lot of time on

576
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,400
is how does network feed apm and

577
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,840
more general devops systems and how do

578
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,919
we do the reverse

579
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,360
there's a lot of application data as we

580
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,600
think about telemetry

581
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,719
that can shine a great light on network

582
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,559
for example

583
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
most switches and routers can't really

584
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,840
give us performance data

585
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
but the app the data that runs right on

586
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,439
top the telemetry from that

587
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,719
combined with network data can be very

588
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,760
useful

589
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,160
um public clouds the growth of public

590
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,679
clouds will definitely outpace

591
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,320
some of the data center when um

592
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,240
and even um in some sense sd-wan as the

593
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,439
cloud providers get into that

594
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,159
um but our world will still grow that's

595
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,080
why i think it's important that we um

596
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,840
educate maybe even with some nano

597
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,840
tutorials about that

598
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,120
so uh to to wind up i've got some i'll

599
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,480
say calls to action

600
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,799
these are really things that i think

601
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,799
about and i'm happy to try to

602
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,240
get involved in for the industry

603
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,080
one of the things that i think about is

604
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
how do we attract new people

605
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,080
that won't alone solve diversity

606
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,679
problems but i think it'll help

607
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,960
a lot to get new people in and if we can

608
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,440
be welcoming enough

609
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,760
ideally in a way that is more

610
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,440
representative of especially early in

611
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,360
career graduating folks

612
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,440
which are more diverse than our current

613
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,799
community so first

614
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,640
i think my one of my

615
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,639
challenges since i've gotten into the

616
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,000
industry is that

617
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,760
for an outsider we sometimes use overly

618
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,600
uh complex and i'll say ietfish

619
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,520
terms not that i have anything against

620
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,399
rfcs and i think being precise is

621
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,440
awesome

622
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,559
but in terms of helping people

623
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,480
understand what we do

624
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,000
i think we have a way to go and one

625
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
thing i would point to

626
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,440
is i don't even think we as an industry

627
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,039
for example in automation or telemetry

628
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,679
have a clear set of uh understanding

629
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,200
about what different kinds of telemetry

630
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,080
what different kinds of automation are

631
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,080
and i think it

632
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,600
it hinders people understanding and

633
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,158
getting into our world

634
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,600
similarly cut the hype and i will try to

635
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,919
do this in my own

636
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,760
activities and company but i do think it

637
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,640
holds us back

638
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,440
both internally inside the networking

639
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,039
community and externally

640
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,120
education and this is something that

641
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,760
i've done some of and

642
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,399
am trying to ramp up to do even more of

643
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,720
um

644
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,440
i think that can help with these things

645
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
and

646
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,720
really as as we think about

647
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,640
our own operations how can we work

648
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,240
better with other groups

649
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,320
internally educating insider

650
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,039
organizations and thinking about the

651
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,280
tooling coming together

652
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,000
so how do we get there you know first as

653
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,799
individuals we make up the community

654
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,400
i will just share that it's been hugely

655
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,720
rewarding for me

656
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,840
to take the things that i see that are

657
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,640
confusing

658
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,039
and try to break them down it helps me

659
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,200
gain

660
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,440
understanding and even though i didn't

661
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,799
start off in the 90s to do that

662
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,919
for uh i would say evil or career goals

663
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,440
it has been super helpful to me uh in my

664
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,480
career and super helpful to

665
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,960
a number of people that i know who

666
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,280
followed this similar journey one

667
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,440
observation i'll share about that is

668
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,559
um if people learn something from you

669
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,080
they will always think

670
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,600
that you are smarter and more

671
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,799
accomplished than they are even if that

672
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,639
was never really the case

673
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,840
in the first place um so there's

674
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,200
definitely

675
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,959
doing well by doing good

676
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,360
as companies also

677
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,159
people know and appreciate companies

678
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
that do

679
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,000
foundational education and i'll call out

680
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,760
an adjacent

681
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,120
company cloudflare who's who's got a

682
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,440
cloudflare learning center

683
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,479
um doing great education about

684
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,600
infrastructure

685
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,760
um it's something that uh that i am i'm

686
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,399
trying to put a lot of focus on as well

687
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,080
and then as an industry i do have some

688
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,240
suggestions and

689
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,439
i see this as someone that has not spent

690
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,159
a lot of time on industry leadership

691
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,760
but as an observer i look at for example

692
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,080
some of the things that ripe does which

693
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,320
is

694
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,280
very definitely chartered differently

695
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,879
than um

696
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,720
we are in north america with our

697
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,520
organizations um

698
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,240
and have been really impressed but i i

699
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,320
think about

700
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,640
you know how can we help break down the

701
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,279
walls do the education

702
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,480
and my suggestions are panels i think

703
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,240
there's been some great panels

704
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,000
especially around diversity

705
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,520
around some of the trends over time and

706
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,640
i'd love to see more of that

707
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,039
tutorials it's something that um

708
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
used to be even heavier really basic

709
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,960
foundational tutorials

710
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,760
and would love to see and help with that

711
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
and i

712
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,039
i think that this is something again

713
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,678
i've seen from ripe and

714
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,000
in analogs and other kinds of uh

715
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,919
operational industries

716
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,120
maybe some curation how can we come

717
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,799
together to curate

718
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,399
some things that are out there and make

719
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,918
them findable um

720
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,000
but linked from um linked from nanag and

721
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,520
other organizations where people go

722
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,360
for specific topics and of a specific

723
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,240
interest like internet working

724
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,559
so for practitioners who of course we

725
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,520
all

726
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,360
make up the communities my specific

727
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,039
advice recommendations and the things

728
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,080
that i'm thinking about

729
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,200
are automation i think we do a

730
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,158
fair bit of basically robotic process

731
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,039
automation

732
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,159
in python without sharing but i think

733
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,840
learning api is

734
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,440
absolutely useful and then thinking

735
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,439
about how to make those

736
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,679
the use of those reusable patterns

737
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,559
within your companies and even

738
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,559
how we share those

739
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,840
cloudification it's something that um

740
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,840
it's something that i've been paying a

741
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,320
lot of attention to

742
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,320
which is just understanding the internet

743
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,559
working or the underlay network

744
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,879
is not really enough for the kinds of

745
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,158
workflows and insights that people need

746
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,240
to drive modern operations and

747
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,159
i would love to see more foundational

748
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,760
training um

749
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,080
and will even volunteer to do some of

750
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,440
that um and nanaga and other groups

751
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,960
uh to break down and explain um the

752
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,799
terminology and the

753
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,400
the internet working methods and the in

754
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,520
the intro networking methods used in

755
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,600
cloud

756
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,799
for us who get involved in the

757
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,199
end-to-end debugging

758
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,879
and then my call to action is

759
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,799
documenting teaching and mentoring the

760
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,320
industry has been very strong at this

761
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,400
i can think of dozens of people that

762
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,439
have done a great job but

763
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,640
the more we do and i would say not only

764
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,799
the senior people

765
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,279
some of the best content that i've seen

766
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,200
is from people that are first learning

767
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,480
because if you can call out those things

768
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,640
that are confusing

769
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
um they wind up being helpful even to

770
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,039
people that have been doing it

771
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,039
for quite some time

772
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,720
so those are my thoughts on where we are

773
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,520
uh the awesomeness of getting to do what

774
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,200
we do

775
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,918
some of the challenges of um of working

776
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
across companies and industries cutting

777
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,880
through the hype

778
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,799
um some thoughts that i have and ways

779
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,320
that i will try to get involved

780
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:38,960
and and be helping as things evolve

781
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:43,259
and now i'm happy to take questions

782
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,259
[Music]

783
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,840
well very good we now have a few minutes

784
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,400
for q a

785
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,639
and there's been a lot of chat a lot of

786
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,320
q a into the chat

787
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,400
first question is there was a comment

788
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,960
about network engineers being replaced

789
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,919
by

790
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:05,039
shell scripts and um also

791
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,240
the fact that earlier 8 is hard

792
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,480
uh and um uh have the question for you

793
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,880
is

794
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,240
um do you think that we need to develop

795
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
people's skills is that something that's

796
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,240
important

797
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,799
yeah i mean i i think the reason we're

798
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,720
not gonna be replaced by shell scripts

799
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,360
is because as we automate the things

800
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,200
that um that are repeatable that are

801
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,320
abstractable

802
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,600
we still need people that hold how

803
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,000
everything works in their head

804
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,678
both for design and architecture and

805
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,480
also for when things don't work right

806
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,559
because

807
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,600
as i said you know in the keynote we we

808
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,799
do have

809
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,879
more than your average kernel um

810
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,639
developer set of bugs in the networking

811
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,520
world and that's to be expected just

812
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,919
given the

813
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,039
case we're moving at and the diversity

814
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,640
of technologies

815
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:57,360
uh you know that we have um

816
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,320
so uh yeah and regarding the second the

817
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,760
second point

818
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,399
that came up on chad that was really a

819
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,960
riff

820
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,080
on the question of how we codify some of

821
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,279
the information

822
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,399
um that we know and find out from

823
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,880
apprenticeship uh which is effectively

824
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,000
a lot of what's driven our careers and

825
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,600
also from the hallway

826
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,320
track at anag where we hear about

827
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,639
uh we hear and learn and people educate

828
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,678
us

829
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,360
when uh when we're coming up and

830
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,919
that also is something which can't

831
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,439
really be encoded the the people glue

832
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,080
that actually makes internet working

833
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,760
work

834
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,279
uh i don't think that's uh that's going

835
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,120
away and that's something that that we

836
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,960
need now and other organizations

837
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,918
uh to continue uh driving

838
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,919
okay uh well very good uh avi we uh

839
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,200
thank you very much for joining us today
