hi everyone my name is pedro i'm an

i'm here to present to you our joint

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,840
work with some folks from

institute for informatics in germany and

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,840
our works about something that you

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,960
are probably very well familiar with

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,800
it's about aas

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,079
path prepending and the reason that we

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,519
decided that we should study

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,640
paper penning is because it one

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,840
of the most deployed uh inbound traffic

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,280
engineering techniques

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,920
for by the network operators if we check

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,399
the evolution of prepending over the

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,039
last 10 years we can see that there is a

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,559
slightly

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,159
increase from 2010 to 2020

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,640
with today approximately 2 30 percent of

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,159
the asses are using path preparing

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,479
somehow either when they are originating

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,600
their own prefixes or when they are

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,360
retributing prefixes that are advertised

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,399
by other asses but the most common cases

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,520
to

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,640
preparing when originating prefixes and

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,600
if we check for example the

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,119
use of path prepending in ipv4 prefixes

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,559
and addresses

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,200
we can see two things first one is that

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,079
all prefixes and addresses are prepended

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,520
to at least

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,360
a given part of the internet but most of

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
those cases are because there are some

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,320
large

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
asses that prepend the prefixes before

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,880
retributing them so there are like

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,960
tier ones that prevent all the prefixes

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,839
before retributing to a given customer

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
that's why

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,560
all uh prefixes are prepended

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,079
but if we look at the pr the prepends by

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,759
the originator

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,679
what we can say is that 25 of the ipv4

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,720
prefixes are being prepended

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,160
for by the prefix originator so

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,640
they already started prepend when they

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,120
get to the internet

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,640
and while prepending is a widely

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,800
deployed technique

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,679
there also has been some controversy

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,560
about

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,879
its utilization there has been some blog

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
posts about the security implications of

63
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,879
pep repenting

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,440
last year dogmatary from oracle pointed

65
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,518
out that

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,480
excessive beach bias pathway painting is

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
a self-inflicted

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,160
vulnerability to the asses we

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
also know about reports in the past

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,000
where

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,440
a path with 252

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,800
prepends caused routers to crash

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,640
and we there is also voices from the

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
community as randy

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,040
that is saying that okay we should use

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,040
more specifics to steer

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,000
our inter-domain traffic and not

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,359
preparing at all for doing that

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,040
and while we see that there is like uh

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,560
good points in both sides we also know

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,120
that

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,599
the use of more specifics could not be

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,840
like

84
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,159
an option for all the asses today

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,599
because we are running out of ipv4

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,239
prefixes and the newer as we're getting

87
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,359
only

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,239
slash is 24 which in theory

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,640
we can de-aggregate then to announce our

90
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,120
prefixes in a more specific manner

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,798
but we we are also aware that there are

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,040
many as that filter

93
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,239
prefix that are more specific than slash

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,120
24.

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
so more specific it's not a suitable

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,840
solution

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,640
in all the cases so the goal

98
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,319
of our research is to contribute to an

99
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,920
informal discussion about

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,000
path repenting without taking any sides

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,599
at the end i will provide some takeaways

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
from our research but

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,159
we did our research without taking any

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,519
sides of preparing something

105
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,439
good or bad for the internet and

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,040
in this talk we will cover path

107
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,760
preparing considering

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,880
three different aspects the first one is

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,478
the deployment

110
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,478
at the beginning i showed you some

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,519
numbers about the deployment of pepper

112
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,800
penny in the past

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,880
10 years we i will show some other

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,520
numbers in the next slides

115
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,120
we also checked about the effectiveness

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,680
of path prepending

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,479
as a traffic engineering tool you

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,960
probably know the answer for this uh

119
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,000
question but as researchers we had to do

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,039
it that

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,919
also to answer that question and

122
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,720
at the end we analyzed the security

123
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,320
implications for the internet routing

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,479
and then we tried to put everything

125
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,840
together with some takeaways

126
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,560
of our research and to perform our

127
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,599
research

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,560
what we did is that we used bhp data

129
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,360
from routeviews riperis and the usolar

130
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,000
project

131
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
and for some active measurements using

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,479
actual

133
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,800
uh bhp prefixes what we did is that we

134
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,080
use it the peering test bed to advertise

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,960
some of our prefixes

136
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
and evaluate how prepend propagates on

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,719
the internet or if

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,440
we can hijack a prefix that is prepended

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,680
and so starting with the deployment of

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,680
path prepending in the first slide we

141
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,720
observed that prepending is a widely

142
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
deployed uh

143
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,240
traffic engineering technique that's

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
fine

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,440
and now we try to understand how the

146
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,600
prefixes have been prepended

147
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,759
by the asses so how the asses are

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,199
preparing their own prefixes

149
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,919
and to that end we created a taxonomy

150
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
with four different classes of prefixes

151
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,599
that i will

152
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,800
describe right now first class is

153
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,440
no which means that that prefix has not

154
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,919
been prepended by the prefix originator

155
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,759
and just to highlight here i will only

156
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,359
talk at this moment about uh

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,120
pre-pens by the prefix originator so

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,039
first class is prefix that's not

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,120
prepended

160
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,440
we have the class about prefix that are

161
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,720
uniformly prepended to everyone

162
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,520
and this is a our curious case that we

163
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
found

164
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,198
and also that dog pointed out last year

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,160
but we did

166
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,960
more digging about this where there is

167
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840
like

168
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
the prefix is being advertised always

169
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,840
with pre-pen and the

170
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,359
pen has always the same size so it's

171
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,080
something that

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,639
awkward there are the cases about the

173
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,039
prefix with a binary prepending policy

174
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,039
where

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,318
the prefix has been announced with two

176
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,440
different options

177
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,759
either zero and two prepends or two

178
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,759
prepends and five prepends

179
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,840
and there is the more diverse class

180
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,240
where the prefix has been advertised

181
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,880
with at least three different pen size

182
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
like one

183
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,719
two and five and what we did is that we

184
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
checked

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,759
the prepends uh policies for all the

186
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,039
prefixes for the past two and a half

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,919
years

188
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,440
and here we have the results first

189
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,639
things that

190
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,000
75 of the prefix are not prepended by

191
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,919
the originator which is

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
kind of the same result from the first

193
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,919
plot of the second plot of muller

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,560
of my presentation that the most common

195
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,880
policy that the ais are employing their

196
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
own prefixes is the binary one which is

197
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,360
the purple lining

198
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,039
here followed by the diverse and the

199
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,800
uniform policies and in this plot i

200
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,080
would like to highlight two different

201
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,120
points the first one is that

202
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,440
there are approximately four percent of

203
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
the prefixes are being uniformly

204
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,199
prepended to

205
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
everyone by the originator so the

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,680
ordinator is announcing that prefix

207
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
with a uniform prepending and

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,919
propagating that prefix to all their

209
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,680
neighbors with the same prep and size

210
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,599
and this four percent correspond to

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,879
approximately 23

212
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,680
000 prefix so it's like only four

213
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,120
percent but

214
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,080
on the other and it's 23 000

215
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,080
prefixes and in the next slides i will

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,878
go into the details about those

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,479
uh cases about the uniform prepending

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,599
and the second thing that i would

219
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,318
like to highlighting here is that little

220
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,639
drop

221
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,720
in the prefix without preparing and

222
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,399
those legal spikes in the

223
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,519
prefix with a binary or diverse policy

224
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,159
and that the period in what that

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,200
happened

226
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,679
is exactly the same period in what

227
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
we were going into the lockdown

228
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,359
measurement

229
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,800
measures and people were starting

230
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,839
working from home and then

231
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,160
we showed those results to some

232
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,160
network operators that may eventually be

233
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,880
watching this presentation

234
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,439
and they said that they also observed an

235
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,000
increasing pathway pending especially

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,040
during live concerns concerts that were

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,760
being broadcasted

238
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,000
on the on the internet and also that

239
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,959
asses were requesting capacity

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,480
increases for their trans providers and

241
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,560
we can also observe that

242
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,360
around may it became to the same uh

243
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,199
fractions that they were before the

244
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,600
outbreak of kovit

245
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,519
so probably the ais has increased their

246
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
capacities and now everything is going

247
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,080
back to

248
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,839
how they were before the outbreak

249
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
so those were the two considerations

250
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,200
that i would like to do

251
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,240
in that plot and now to take a deeper

252
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,040
look into the uniform preparing cases

253
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,920
that we have

254
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,199
observed in the previous plot we first

255
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,399
want to understand

256
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,560
if the uniform prepending is something

257
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,519
that is consistent

258
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,160
over time or if it's something that

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,680
changes

260
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,959
over time and to that end what we did is

261
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,040
that we fixed

262
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,199
a reference snapshot for us which is

263
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,880
january 2019

264
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,040
and at that point we took all the prefix

265
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,680
that were uniformly prepended

266
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,480
in that particular snapshot and we

267
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,079
checked

268
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,360
how those prefixes were prepended before

269
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,800
that date and after that date

270
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,640
and we can see that for many of them the

271
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
uniform prepending condition is

272
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,360
something that is transitory

273
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,439
they were uniformly prepared at a given

274
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,480
point for some particular reason

275
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,519
eventually we were missing some data as

276
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
well but

277
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,920
for like 12 000

278
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,439
prefixes they were uniformly prepended

279
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,160
for at least one year so we can infer

280
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,760
first that

281
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,640
for some prefix is something that's

282
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,560
transient but for others is something

283
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,920
that's consistent over time

284
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,319
and then we

285
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,000
discuss it with some network operators

286
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,040
to understand possible

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,959
reasons for such a condition

288
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,240
and what we have heard from them is that

289
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,640
one possible cause of uniform prepending

290
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,000
could be the loss of a neighbor so i was

291
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,800
using a binary

292
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
policy and now i have only a one trans

293
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,880
provider and i'm

294
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,199
preparing to that trans provider so i

295
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,160
did

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
i didn't change my uh php configuration

297
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,319
that would be

298
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,320
one possibility the second one

299
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,720
especially that was something that the

300
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,360
brazilian operator said to us

301
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
is that there are many operators that

302
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
actually didn't

303
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,440
know how to operate bhp so they are

304
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,000
preparing their prefix but they do not

305
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
know

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,760
why exactly they are doing that

307
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
third one is that they are aware that

308
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,760
they need

309
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,240
they do not need that prepend anymore

310
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
but

311
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,079
since things are working i will not

312
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,320
change that

313
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,680
fourth condition well fourth possible

314
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
cause is that

315
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,719
good news travel fast bad news travel

316
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,880
slowly

317
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,839
so it will be easier for traffic

318
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,000
engineering if i prepend all my prefix

319
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,880
and then when i need to shift traffic i

320
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,920
will just

321
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,760
remove the prepends from a given path

322
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,920
instead of adding prepends on the paths

323
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,920
that i'm not willing to use at that

324
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,319
moment

325
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,000
the other possible cause would be like

326
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,279
sibling artifacts we found

327
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,800
cases where two asses belonging to the

328
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,240
same organization

329
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,359
were announcing the same prefix both

330
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,560
with uniform policies but the prepend

331
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,600
size was different

332
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,439
so actually it was like more a binary

333
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
policy because for the same prefix we

334
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,720
had

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,360
two different alternatives for is

336
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,279
belonging to the same organization

337
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
and the last condition that they the

338
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,240
last possible cause that they mentioned

339
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,480
to us is that

340
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,959
there could be some asses that are

341
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,639
ignoring the preparing maybe do it to a

342
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,279
route optimizer so they

343
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,360
need to keep that prefix uniformly

344
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,040
prepended to everyone because some asses

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,639
are ignoring the prepension that's is

346
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,839
how we're working

347
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,839
for them to perform traffic engineering

348
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,519
uh also another thing that we didn't

349
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,399
hear is that uh

350
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,040
operators asked us if those prefix carry

351
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,839
traffic

352
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,240
or not those that are uniformly

353
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,399
prepended and

354
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,480
we checked the flowing for information

355
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,480
in a large european ixp

356
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,720
and we found that there are prefixes

357
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,959
that are uniformly prepended

358
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
that are carrying multiple gigabits of

359
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,399
traffic per second

360
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,839
so they are not prefix that we can

361
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,880
ignore because they carry

362
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,920
actual traffic in there

363
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,360
um going to the second part about the

364
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,000
effectiveness of pepper

365
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,000
pepper penny in this step of our work we

366
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,040
we used the peering test bed to

367
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
advertise

368
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,079
our prefixes and

369
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,719
to test the effectiveness of peppery

370
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,160
penny what we did is that

371
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,600
we used the peering test bed and

372
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,839
for every round we took two different

373
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
pops that appearing test bed offers to

374
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,760
us

375
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:15,040
and announced our prefix without prepend

376
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,560
in both pops and then

377
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,599
after 15 minutes for php convergence

378
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,839
we performed a set of ping measurements

379
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,279
towards a set of targets

380
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,480
and identified in which of the pops

381
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,720
we got the response so like

382
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,800
sixty percent of our traffic are coming

383
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,360
top one and forty percent of the traffic

384
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,560
is coming

385
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,760
from pop two and then what we did is

386
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,839
that

387
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,000
in one of the pops we prepended our

388
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,800
prefix

389
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,079
and then repeated the second and the

390
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,959
third steps to

391
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,359
check how many targets we were able to

392
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,479
shift from one pop to the other

393
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,040
by prepending one of the pops and that's

394
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,199
how we

395
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,639
measure the effectiveness of path

396
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,839
preparing in our

397
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,639
uh experiment

398
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,440
so here i will show the results for

399
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,040
every

400
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,040
pair of pops that we have evaluated

401
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,519
so in the x-axis we have the pop that

402
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,639
was

403
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,399
not prepended and on the y-axis we have

404
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,480
the pop that we prepared

405
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,839
after the first set of measurements

406
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,880
and here we have one cell for

407
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,759
each of the experiments i know that

408
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,040
there is a lot of information in here

409
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,800
but the

410
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,959
most important point that i would like

411
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,680
to highlight is regarding the background

412
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,479
color of

413
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,439
each cell what the background color of

414
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,199
each cell

415
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,160
shows to us is that the fraction of

416
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,680
possibly movable targets that we were

417
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,319
able to shift

418
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,040
from one target from one pop to the

419
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,720
other by

420
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,599
using path preparing in each scenario

421
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,279
so colors that are closer to yellow are

422
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,639
scenarios where preparing was

423
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,199
very effective and colors

424
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,480
that are closer to purple are scenarios

425
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,680
where prepending was

426
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,000
not that effective at all

427
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,560
so what we can observe for example is

428
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,759
that for this particular case here in

429
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,880
utah

430
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,959
in all cases were not able to shift

431
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,480
any traffic using path prepending and

432
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,439
this is likely related to the

433
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,480
connectivity of that particular pup

434
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,720
and that in other pops the result was

435
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,720
diverse for example here we have a

436
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,839
yellow cell where prepending was very

437
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,120
effective

438
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,920
but here it was purple and here was blue

439
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,120
and green here we have other case of

440
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,199
yellow

441
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,480
so our takeaway here is that when we are

442
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,120
when we were using only two different uh

443
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,759
locations the effectiveness of pathway

444
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,639
painting

445
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,279
was very dependent on the location that

446
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,639
we were

447
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,160
using for our experiments and then there

448
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,240
is another experiment

449
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,679
where we announced our prefix

450
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,880
using all pops and we did the following

451
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,160
we prepended our prefix in all but

452
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,360
one pop or vice versa in none

453
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,079
but one puck and in those cases where we

454
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,599
had

455
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,960
multiple uh location points

456
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,360
pre-pending was very effective for

457
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
those gates so our takeaway here is that

458
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,039
if you have

459
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,280
only two locations two upstreams maybe

460
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,000
perpendi will not be that effective but

461
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,559
if you have

462
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
more than two it's likely to be a very

463
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,360
effective traffic engineering

464
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,440
technique and lastly

465
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,719
what we did is that uh given that there

466
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,960
are some concerns

467
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,600
from the community about the security

468
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,400
implications of per perpendi

469
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,159
we did two analysis here the first one

470
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,919
we evaluated if

471
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,440
those security implications are

472
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,240
practical if we can

473
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,360
actually hijack prefixes that are using

474
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,880
path prepending

475
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,600
and then second we analyze it

476
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,840
how many prefix in that code in the

477
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,918
those particular conditions we found on

478
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,559
the internet

479
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,760
so starting first with testing the

480
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,240
practicality of

481
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,280
the attacks exploiting path prepending

482
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,000
we again

483
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,200
used the peering test bed for for our

484
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
experiment

485
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,240
and our methodology was the following

486
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,039
first

487
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
we again took pairs of pops for this

488
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,720
experiment

489
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,080
for each pair of pups we announced that

490
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,400
our prefix with

491
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,678
zero zero per pounds or one two and

492
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,360
three per pence depending on the

493
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,559
iteration that we did we tested

494
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,678
all the four cases and we

495
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,879
waited for 15 minutes

496
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,000
and then we started announcing our

497
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,039
prefix in the second pop using

498
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,559
a different asn as the origin

499
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:05,760
as asn for that uh prefix so in pop

500
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,320
one prefix was being announced using one

501
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,640
asn

502
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,600
as the origin and in pop two we were

503
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
using a different

504
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,360
asn both asms belonging to the peering

505
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,159
test bed

506
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,039
so we were not using asn's from anyone

507
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
those were the

508
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,720
ones from the peering test bed and what

509
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,080
we did is that

510
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,200
we tested or actually we

511
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,480
measured for how many

512
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,440
bhp monitors and we had at least 400

513
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,320
monitors

514
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,440
that we were able to access that they

515
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,240
were

516
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,080
adopting the hijacked alternative so how

517
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,640
many monitors were preferring the

518
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,678
hijacked

519
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,080
route here

520
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,960
we have the results for that this

521
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,399
experiment

522
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,880
and it's another tricky plot but i will

523
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,520
go into the details in here

524
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
we used five locations for this

525
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,120
experiment amsterdam

526
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,880
seattle georgia tech gr net and

527
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,918
cleansome

528
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,039
we also uh here have the numbers of

529
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,080
upstreams that were

530
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,879
available for each of the locations so

531
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,000
43 for amsterdam 33 for seattle and so

532
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,360
on

533
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,960
and the x-axis we have how was our

534
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,918
original announcement so

535
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,280
for example a0 means that we were

536
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,799
advertising our

537
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,360
prefix from amsterdam without prepends

538
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:31,039
and then we try to hijack that prefix

539
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,439
from one of the locations on the y-axis

540
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,280
c1 means that we were advertising that

541
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,000
prefix from cleanse on with

542
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,039
one prepend and then try to hijack from

543
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,520
one place

544
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,200
in the y-axis that that is listed on the

545
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,720
y-axis

546
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,200
and here we have the results the color

547
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,600
indication indicates the fraction the

548
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,720
percentage of the monitors that started

549
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,760
adopting the hijacked routes so colors

550
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,400
that cells that are

551
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,280
closer to yellow are the ones where we

552
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,720
we succeeded

553
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,280
more and i would like to highlight three

554
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,799
different

555
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,559
aspects from this plot the first one

556
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,918
is that every time we were originally

557
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,799
announcing our prefix with triprepends

558
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,440
the success of our hijacking was almost

559
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,720
complete so it was close to 100 percent

560
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,440
for those cases second

561
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,559
aspect is that if you are a well

562
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,760
connected as like we were in amsterdam

563
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,080
we were able to hijack the prefix

564
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,039
all the time independently of that

565
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,639
prefix

566
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,760
was if that prefix was prepended or not

567
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,400
and lastly if we check the case from

568
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,000
clemson which is an ais that is not well

569
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,039
connected because it has only

570
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,039
one upstream in all cases where the

571
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,559
prefix was being announced

572
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,559
with three prepends we succeeded in

573
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,760
hijacking the prefix

574
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,240
so the takeaway here is that

575
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,879
if you are announcing your prefix with

576
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,840
at least

577
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,159
triple pens almost everyone can

578
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,360
completely hijack you

579
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,159
if you use stripper pens if you use one

580
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,918
or two

581
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,919
it will depend on the size of the as

582
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,000
that is trying to do that

583
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,440
and again here we were considering that

584
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
our prefix was

585
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,520
uniformly prepended and and we know that

586
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,080
in many cases or in most case prefix are

587
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,720
using a binary policy or a diverse

588
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,158
policy for their pre-pens

589
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,760
but that's partially true because

590
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,280
what we did next is that we analyzed

591
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,320
all the prefix that are prepended

592
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,158
and we check at the minimum prep and

593
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,879
size for that prefix

594
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,919
so if a prefix is using a binary policy

595
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
and it's used

596
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,000
it's not prepended in one upstream and

597
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,159
it's prepended with a size two in the

598
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,280
other upstream the minimum prepared size

599
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,640
is zero but we found many cases

600
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,200
of a binary policy where uh

601
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,440
the minimum size was not zero and that

602
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,559
is what we are showing

603
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,480
in this plot where we have the number of

604
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,960
prefix that are being were being

605
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,400
originated in may 2020

606
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,520
with at least one two or three or more

607
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,880
prepends

608
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,200
so in total here we have like 38

609
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,480
000 prefix that seems to have

610
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,919
unnecessary prepends in their

611
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,440
announcements

612
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:37,120
i know that this could be a result

613
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,320
of a lack of visibility of our bjp

614
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,039
monitors but one thing that we also did

615
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,240
that we spoke with operators from two

616
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,679
large cdns

617
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,240
and one medium-sized cdn with uh

618
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,960
hundreds of interconnection points and

619
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,520
we asked

620
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,320
them to provide us with answers true or

621
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,240
false

622
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,000
for each prefix if they were seeing

623
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,640
something different that what we are

624
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
seeing

625
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,400
and for like the vast majority of cases

626
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,360
their answer was

627
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,320
no they were seeing exactly what we were

628
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,120
seeing

629
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,760
so we know that there could be some lack

630
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,399
of

631
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,360
visibility in here but for only a few

632
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,200
cases

633
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,360
so first consideration here there are a

634
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
lot of prefix that are being

635
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,240
announced with something that seems to

636
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,360
be unnecessary

637
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,200
and second thing that we analyze that

638
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,760
okay we know that rpki may help us to

639
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,120
prevent

640
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,799
some of those attacks if the as

641
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,678
is not forging the originator as

642
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,240
in the path i mean sorry if the s is

643
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,360
forging

644
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,919
the originator as and

645
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,639
what we try to do here is that we check

646
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,440
it

647
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,480
for the prefix that are not prepended

648
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
which are the

649
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,520
verb the purple curve in there

650
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,960
the fraction of those prefix that are

651
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,679
covered by row

652
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,840
objects against the fraction of prefix

653
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
that are prepended and are covered by

654
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,399
raw

655
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,799
objects and what we can infer from this

656
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,240
plot

657
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,960
is that there is no difference

658
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,799
regarding rows and prepending if that

659
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,120
prefix is being prepended or not

660
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,240
it's not the case that i know that i'm

661
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,600
using prepend

662
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,679
so i will create a row object to protect

663
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,080
my prefix because someone may try to

664
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,400
exploit prepending to hijack me

665
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,678
so there is no correlation between both

666
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,640
uh

667
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,120
metrics and again we recommend everyone

668
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,159
to create

669
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,959
raw objects for their prefix so this

670
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,159
will help

671
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,279
preventing some hijacking cases so

672
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,039
to conclude uh this talk

673
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,640
i would like to summarize everything

674
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,440
that uh

675
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,640
we did and to take aside in this

676
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,720
discussion because at the beginning i

677
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,760
said that we will not take sides

678
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,799
at least during our presentation so

679
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,799
summarizing

680
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,000
what we have shown in here regarding the

681
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,879
deployments that

682
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,960
path prepend is still a very present uh

683
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,520
inbound shaft engineering technique

684
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,840
that there are more than 20 000 prefix

685
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,279
that are

686
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,039
uniformly prepended to everyone and

687
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,480
those are kind of something that

688
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,400
need some attention pre-painting was

689
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,960
important during the first month so the

690
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,840
covid

691
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,760
outbreak so people can deal with the

692
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,840
traffic surge

693
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,879
related to a lot of people working from

694
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,559
home

695
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,640
regarding the effectiveness of path

696
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,320
prepending what we found that if we are

697
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,400
using only two locations the

698
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,520
effectiveness is very dependent on the

699
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,840
locations

700
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,639
but if we have more than two locations

701
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,000
it works

702
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,200
really well to shift traffic

703
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,440
and regarding the security implications

704
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,559
we found that if you are preparing you

705
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,200
are prefixed at least

706
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,000
three times you are like at risk and

707
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,559
someone even

708
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,679
someone that's not well connected will

709
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,440
be able to

710
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,320
hijack your prefix and also

711
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,960
that there are 38 000 prefix with

712
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,240
possibly

713
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,919
unnecessary prepends so

714
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:13,520
to take a side in this discussion

715
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,679
we are definitely not advocating against

716
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,158
using path prepending because we

717
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,159
recognize the value of path preparing as

718
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,440
a traffic engineering tool

719
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,840
but we also want to make our pointing

720
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,760
here

721
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,520
and recommend the community to review

722
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,000
their prepending policies

723
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,960
removing some unnecessary prependance

724
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,760
and

725
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,080
as much as possible using a small prep

726
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,520
and

727
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,879
size for inbound traffic engineering

728
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:44,000
this is a summary of what we are

729
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,480
presenting in our imc paper so if you

730
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,640
are

731
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,000
interested please check our paper it's

732
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,880
available online also

733
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,679
feel free to contact us and if you want

734
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,919
to discuss

735
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,919
about pre-painting or any other aspect

736
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,320
related to internet routing

737
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,520
feel free to contact me or to contact my

738
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,639
great colleague lars

739
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,879
which was also the other first author

740
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,799
of this work and with that i conclude my

741
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:17,760
talk and happy to take your questions

742
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:20,320
thank you

743
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,360
thank you pedro uh we are so happy that

744
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,879
you could join us

745
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,918
uh and uh give us this insightful uh

746
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,720
talk uh let's see uh what questions the

747
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,159
audience has in store for you i just

748
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,399
switched to the

749
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,159
livestream chat so yeah so i see a

750
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,600
question regarding the network and

751
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,960
research uh

752
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,719
networks uh for universities the nrn

753
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,240
do you have any visibility into the

754
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,080
prefixes that are

755
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,399
advertised into the nrem

756
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,360
what do you mean by the the the academic

757
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,879
networks

758
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,799
or yeah they can make research

759
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,039
universities yeah those networks

760
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,240
yeah yeah we we have some insights

761
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,600
regarding that we

762
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,640
found at least one case

763
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,279
in which the nrn was

764
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,440
using uniform prepending policies that

765
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,559
was the case in brazil

766
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,000
and we contacted them like saying

767
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,120
hey are you really doing that

768
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,640
and we unfortunately we got no answer

769
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,520
about that so

770
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,520
we actually we have all the the names of

771
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,679
the ais that are kinda

772
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,360
using prepending and doing like

773
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,159
something that we may consider that's

774
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,240
not the

775
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,440
the breast best practices about path

776
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,679
prepending

777
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,600
but here we decided not to point any

778
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,960
specific case like to

779
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,918
not blame and shame anyone

780
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
okay and i did hear you mentioned during

781
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,039
the talk that the

782
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,080
bjp collectors may not be seeing

783
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,480
everything

784
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,240
so uh can you tell us a bit about any

785
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,679
kind of verifications that you did to

786
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,919
confirm that assumption

787
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,760
or that suspicion of yours that you were

788
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,440
doing some wrongful inference on the

789
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,879
uniform policy

790
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,720
yeah sure uh the first thing that we did

791
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,000
is that given that we have like more

792
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,760
than 500

793
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,080
monitors in our analysis we only decided

794
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,279
to

795
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,559
check the policies of the prefix that we

796
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,120
were seeing in at least

797
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,840
one third of our bhp monitors so in that

798
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,080
case

799
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,399
we are not saying that an as was using

800
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,360
for example a uniform policy because we

801
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,000
are seeing that a

802
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,639
that prefix in only one of our monitors

803
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,159
so you guarantee that we had at least

804
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,279
a given visibility for each prefix

805
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,399
and also as we comment on the talk

806
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,960
we asked three different citians

807
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,158
to validate our influence saying if they

808
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,200
were seeing something

809
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,840
different that we were seeing

810
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,000
so like we approached them and it were

811
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,158
they were like two global cdns in the

812
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,600
regional cdn that validate this

813
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,440
information for us

814
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,360
and it was approximately like one

815
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,799
percent or two percent of the case they

816
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,840
were seeing something

817
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,639
different for from what we were seeing

818
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,840
and also we use a set of traceroute

819
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,000
measurements to

820
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,158
using a tool called border map i.t

821
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,440
to identify their connection links that

822
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,399
we may have missed

823
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,679
in our bhp data so while we were not

824
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,239
able to infer

825
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,320
anything about the announcements in that

826
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,120
interconnection link that we found

827
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,039
we were able to at least say that okay

828
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,439
for this particular aes we are not

829
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,799
seeing

830
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,000
all the interconnection links of that as

831
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,480
but in that case for the as advertising

832
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,360
uniformly prepended prefix the number of

833
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,039
new interconnection links was very small

834
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,000
so we kind of did all these steps to

835
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,120
validate our

836
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,880
findings okay thank you and i did

837
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,360
receive a clarification to

838
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,720
the answer you got about the um and the

839
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,959
academic networks

840
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,640
i think uh what adam uh who posed the

841
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
original question what he was interested

842
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,200
in

843
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,960
is whether your data set it includes his

844
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,320
preference both to the commercial as

845
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,519
well as the academic network

846
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,200
that's both included yeah yeah the uh

847
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,360
our data sets include like

848
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,039
we have the route views the rivalries

849
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,399
and these all our projects and there are

850
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,279
a lot of networks that

851
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,678
they peer with those projects to share

852
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,480
their

853
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,919
routing tables and it includes every

854
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,480
kind of networks in there

855
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,200
so we have like i wouldn't say complete

856
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,960
