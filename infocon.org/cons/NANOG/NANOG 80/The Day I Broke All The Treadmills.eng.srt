00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
hello

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,400
my name is jen i am a network engineer

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,160
at google in australia

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,599
and i've been with google for like more

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,480
than 10 years

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,320
initially working on production backbone

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,359
and for the last

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,560
six years i've been looking after

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,039
corporate part of the google network and

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
all of the time i've been mostly working

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,399
on itdc

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,480
so today i'm gonna speak about something

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,520
really exciting what i've done

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,480
about something i broke so let me show

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
you some slides

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,398
and another thing you know uh you need

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,280
to know about me

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,960
is that i'm a big fan of comic sans so

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,239
some people might be suffering for the

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,600
next half an hour

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,599
sorry about that so

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,320
what i'm going to talk about today is

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
something people might consider almost

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,800
impossible

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
almost like unicorn my talk will be

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,798
about

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
turning ipv4 off in the enterprise

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
environment

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,880
and migrating an enterprise network to

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,119
ipv6 only mode

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,240
why why would anything person do that

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,280
i actually had plenty of reasons to do

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,479
that

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,960
first of all believe it or not we run

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,560
out of ipv4 address space

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,880
yes private one it's possible

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
secondly i am getting more and more

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,039
requests from various business units and

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,560
developers

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
for ipv6 only environment for dog food

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
and

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,280
tasting and last but not least

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
i am heavily involved in operations and

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
i

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
found that dual stiffness will come

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,758
through the cost

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,600
operating dual stack is actually harder

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,680
than operating symbols tech network

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,919
because you basically created

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,119
two networks at the same time and you

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,520
need to make sure

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,520
their configurations are consistent and

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,560
troubleshooting is a bit tricky

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,160
thanks for happy eyeballs so in our

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,239
attempt to save

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,359
private address space activity for

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,160
address space

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,599
and simplify the network we decided to

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,840
try something impossible

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,079
and turn off ipv4 in the part of the

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,080
network

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,879
to do the pilot and proof of concept

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,560
we decided to take the low-hanging fruit

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,040
and migrate our

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,840
corporate guest network to ipv6 only

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,160
mode

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,360
our guest network actually consists of

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,120
two parts

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,519
one is guest wi-fi if you ever visited

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,760
one of google offices you'll probably

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,480
notice that you have google guest wi-fi

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,319
which is open in most of the offices and

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,679
you can connect visitors can connect

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,200
their device

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,120
actually it's the biggest wi-fi network

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,720
we have in the corporate environment

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
most most of our wi-fi users modern

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,560
house

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,800
are actually using guest wi-fi

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
also we have a wired guest network which

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,040
is used for

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,640
unauthorized unknown devices connected

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,679
to a wired internet

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,319
and also it's used as a fallback

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,879
network in case of dot one x

87
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,920
authentication

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,000
so how we did that

89
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
obviously we still need to provide

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,720
access for

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
guest devices to ipv4 only internet

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,560
resources

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,040
so what we needed is not 64

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,239
and dnf64 which obviously are the key

95
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,599
element of

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,640
uh providing access to for destinations

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,599
for dns we were using google public dns

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,279
64

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,798
which we launched in 2015 as far as i

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,040
can remember

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,959
because for normal dual text network we

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,519
also using google public dns

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,519
so it was of those choice we didn't have

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,799
any form of the

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,640
it's pure slug so we were providing dns

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,080
explore information to host

107
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,480
via rdnss dns

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
ips were sent in our router

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,679
advertisement

110
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,199
for not fix for for translating

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,000
ipv6 traffic to ipv4 we were using the

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,160
same

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
devices which were indulged that

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,199
environment doing translation from

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,320
private ipv4 under space to public id

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,639
for address space

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,639
those devices located to fight age so it

118
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,919
was easy basically no new network

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,479
elements the same

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,840
path for traffic we just replaced in one

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,840
form of not with another

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
when we started the pilot for guest

123
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,360
network

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,520
i wanted to answer a number of questions

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,160
which could be summarized as

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,919
what exactly will be broken because you

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
don't know what you don't know

128
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,960
and guest devices by definition devices

129
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,919
we do not control

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,960
and we have no idea what they are how

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,599
many devices

132
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,198
actually can send music from the network

133
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,720
i had some guestimate

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,880
because it's not the first ipv6 only

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
network i've seen a number of

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,600
conferences do the same

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,360
for example arrive has v6 only network

138
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,080
uh as well as far as i know

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,919
first game is doing v6 only and we

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,120
actually did some experiments

141
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,440
at itf network as well i expected that

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
maybe 75 percent of devices would be

143
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,160
okay but

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,160
obviously it would depend on the

145
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,039
environment so i needed more solid

146
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,000
numbers

147
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,320
also another interesting question was

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,080
how our tech support

149
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,039
would survive because some people were

150
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,560
concerned that

151
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:55,120
we might get too many unhappy customers

152
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,800
so we decided to do some tests on this

153
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,919
i connected 12 sites for the pilot

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,319
and obviously if you decided to try this

155
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,758
at home your experience may vary

156
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,880
i had four uh primary criteria

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,120
first uh low size uh

158
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,960
i had to have network operations people

159
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
inside to simplify the

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,359
troubleshooting so i actually started

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,600
from my home sydney office i wanted to

162
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,520
do the pilot on locations when we have

163
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,120
large number of users

164
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,560
to make the the data more statistically

165
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,160
reliable and also i took into account

166
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,800
customer demands so sites where we get

167
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,039
most number of requests for ipv6 on the

168
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,000
network from developers were included

169
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,039
into the pilot

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,240
because it meant that we'll get users

171
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,039
there

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,560
and those users are willing to try that

173
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,560
network and help us

174
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:59,039
finding issues so as i mentioned

175
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:02,319
we had two segments wireless environment

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,599
and we did pilot for them separately

177
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,639
provided it was easier for about

178
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,000
six or nine months we just turned

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,840
off ipv4 on the segment converted

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,319
into v6 only i mean replace dns with dns

181
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,679
x4

182
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,240
and for users who need ipv4

183
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,039
we provided a self-service portal to

184
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,400
re-enable

185
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,440
ipd4 on the given wordport but

186
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,000
users were asked and encouraged

187
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,639
to tell us why they requested atv4

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,880
because

189
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,400
as i mentioned one of the goal of the

190
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,880
pilot was to find out

191
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
what is broken and why so we'd like to

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,080
enumerate

193
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,479
all possible issues so

194
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
for any deployment story the most

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,560
interesting part

196
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,520
is always one good broken right everyone

197
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,080
wants to

198
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
hear the worst story so the biggest

199
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,560
brokerage

200
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,280
i caused happened on the first pilot

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,360
site

202
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,440
right away and it probably was the

203
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
biggest issue we discovered

204
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
i mean in term in terms of number of

205
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,639
people i'm happy and how urgent it was

206
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,159
to fix it

207
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,400
and what i broke was treadmill

208
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,199
yes we have a number of officers where

209
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,719
we have

210
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,639
gym gyms on site and those gyms have all

211
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,520
these smart

212
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,319
uh exercise devices which are connected

213
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,599
to the internet i did not even notice

214
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,080
until all this project happened right

215
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,039
apparently those devices need internet

216
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
connection

217
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,159
and most of them are really not happy

218
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,560
when you take ipv4 away

219
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,439
so fortunately we were able to recover

220
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,399
those devices providing them ipv4 and we

221
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,760
started discussion with treadmill vendor

222
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,160
actually about fixing the problem

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,680
and we still waited for them to come

224
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,880
with

225
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,519
a new version which will support ipv6 on

226
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,320
your network

227
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,000
so as i may as i said about six or nine

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,560
months of the pilot

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
the results were actually quite good

230
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,119
most of the sites

231
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,560
except ones which had treadmills

232
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,640
did not need many ipv4 enabled ports

233
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,040
the maximum number we saw like five

234
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,439
devices per site

235
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,399
which allowed us to save a lot of other

236
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,519
space because

237
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,040
a wired network had to be provisioned

238
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,399
to allow all our corporate devices

239
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,959
to end up on the guest network if uh

240
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,519
dot one x authentication failed so we

241
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,399
had to provision a lot of other space

242
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,959
for dual stack wireless gear and by

243
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,000
making

244
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,560
eight v6 only we were able to recover

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,160
i would say two three hundred thousand

246
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,640
addresses actually

247
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,920
and main ipv4 use case we discovered

248
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,959
from the wired guests

249
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,360
was various types of embedded systems

250
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,439
like treadmills ied stuff

251
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
not actual laptops it was mostly some

252
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,120
special devices which

253
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:09,439
uh did not even know about v6

254
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,480
so for virulence we decided to take baby

255
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,839
steps

256
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,000
so we did the pilot in two phases

257
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:22,240
phase one was opting

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,880
which lasts for a year and a half

259
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,880
during that phase we created a special

260
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,680
dedicated new ssid

261
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,040
on the pilot site we sent an email to

262
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,239
all users outside

263
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,279
and asked them to try the uss id

264
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,279
and report the issue

265
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,160
and after we became confident that

266
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,480
we're not going to see too many problems

267
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,680
with

268
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:53,440
itv6000 we switched to opt out

269
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,640
we for about nine months

270
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,680
we made our primary

271
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,880
standard google guest ssid

272
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,000
six only but for users who still need

273
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,120
ipv4 we created a special dedicated

274
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
fallback ssid

275
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,640
which had not existed on those sites

276
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,279
before and again

277
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,760
we asked users please come and tell us

278
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,839
what broke and don't just switch back to

279
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,160
dual secret id because we need to know

280
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,839
what is broken

281
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,360
so what we found during the pilot

282
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:31,440
on those 12 sites for wi-fi

283
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,079
phase one about 10 percent of users

284
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,760
actually tried new ssid which was much

285
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,079
much better than i expected you know

286
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,439
people tend to ignore such emails

287
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,439
but yet ten percent of them

288
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,640
we asked users to report banks

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,040
and we even uh offered a draw

290
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,160
so the winner person who reported the

291
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,199
most number

292
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,480
of banks was supposed to win 100 dollars

293
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,079
donated to a charity of their choice

294
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,959
actually we got 15 bucks reported

295
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,479
and three of them were fixed as a result

296
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,560
well as a typical situation with

297
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,120
operations nothing gets fixed until

298
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,760
people complain right

299
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
so before even we start moving majority

300
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,480
of the users towards examiner we already

301
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,839
have

302
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,800
have some bug clips when we moved

303
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,760
majority of the users

304
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,880
to v6 only we noticed that less than

305
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,160
five percent of

306
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,320
users fall back to dual security

307
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,279
that was actually much much better than

308
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,279
i expected

309
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,320
my guesstimate before the start of the

310
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,839
project was maybe

311
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,120
25 percent well actually 10

312
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,760
of those users were

313
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,680
using 2.4 gigahertz for that id which we

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,639
did not migrate to v6 only

315
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,479
so out of all guest users they have 10

316
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,160
percent which stayed on dual stack

317
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,160
because we didn't touch them

318
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,880
five percent fall back to dual set of

319
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,000
society so basically about 85 percent of

320
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,880
our users

321
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,839
were quite happy being on v6 only

322
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,519
network

323
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,399
in absolute numbers it's actually quite

324
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,480
a lot the peak device counts in one day

325
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,920
was 25k

326
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,079
so i had 25 000 users only heaps on the

327
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,519
network

328
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,599
and not so many bugs reported 12

329
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,560
in total and we bought four of them

330
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,399
fixed

331
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,920
mostly internal style but we also

332
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,399
reported a number of external

333
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,240
applications

334
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,120
so remember those questions i wanted to

335
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,440
get answered during the pilot

336
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,399
what percentage of users need you for as

337
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,199
i said

338
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,079
we got about five percent explicitly

339
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,120
falling back

340
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,439
and 10 percent were just staying on 2.4

341
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,440
and they were not even affected by this

342
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,160
project

343
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
so wi-fi and for wired as i say five

344
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,319
devices per site

345
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,079
maximum except special locations with

346
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,720
treadmills

347
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,439
as a result we saved a lot of address

348
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,399
space

349
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
for wi-fi our adhd people utilization

350
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,160
dropped by

351
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,160
five eight times which actually matches

352
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,800
fifteen percent of users stand on gold

353
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,880
stacks

354
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:16,240
so we basically were able to downsize

355
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,399
uh dhcp pools by four

356
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,480
in some cases eight times which again

357
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,120
was huge savings of other space

358
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,000
and for virus we basically reclaimed

359
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,639
hundreds of thousands of ap

360
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
what did not work well i think my

361
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,680
current list is about

362
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,880
20 items i have a special

363
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,920
a list of things which do not work top

364
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,199
five number one is definitely dream

365
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,319
revenue

366
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,000
number two this one actually got a lot

367
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,880
of complaints from users

368
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,600
and i need a community help here spotify

369
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,920
application

370
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
on the laptop it works perfectly final

371
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,880
phones

372
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,199
it works in the browser mode but if

373
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,519
you're using a dedicated app

374
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,719
on macquarie and i think on windows as

375
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,519
well

376
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
it's very unhappy there is no ipv4 so

377
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,279
please

378
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,360
if you ever use spotify click on this

379
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
link and upload the feature requests i

380
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,360
opened with them

381
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,320
to get that fixed well the third thing

382
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
is bpm

383
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,519
we knew it's gonna happen there is no

384
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,480
reason

385
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,839
why vtns protocol would not work over

386
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,959
ipv6 only and it does work if vpn server

387
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,639
is properly configured unfortunately in

388
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,518
many cases

389
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,920
server administrators do not enable ipv6

390
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,440
on the

391
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,199
vpn system and as a result servers don't

392
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,720
want to establish a connection with a

393
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,479
client which doesn't have ipv4 address

394
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,240
but again it's not a protocol problem

395
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,040
it's just configuration machinery both

396
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,959
sides

397
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,160
well yeah some people complained about

398
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,119
start crafts not

399
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,800
not working i am not sure it was built

400
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,560
on critical applications but people

401
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,399
aren't happy

402
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,479
also i got reports about marquez

403
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,480
recovery image not working over which

404
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,880
it's only but also what i've heard

405
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,680
that go away so probably it's not such a

406
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
big of an issue

407
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,079
one of the important questions for us

408
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,160
was how we're going to provide

409
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,000
fallback mechanism for users who need

410
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,279
ipv4 because

411
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,120
i've i never expected that we can

412
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,160
migrate all users

413
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,680
i understand some of them will need ipv4

414
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,719
so one of our

415
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,120
options where okay maybe we can use

416
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,639
dedicated assess id we can use dedicated

417
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,639
network

418
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,079
but how we're going to do that convert

419
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,600
network

420
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,239
or what we're doing currently a user

421
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,279
must open a ticket and tell us that they

422
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,079
need ipv4

423
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,320
because we want to know who those users

424
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,800
are

425
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,120
why they need ipv4 and we're only

426
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,920
granting them that exception for 18

427
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,079
months

428
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,920
because we do not want users to relax

429
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,079
and sit forever and do nothing about

430
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,839
fixing the application

431
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,559
for wi-fi when the tab doing dedicated

432
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,240
ssid

433
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,918
but i thought about strata general

434
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,199
explained a little bit later

435
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,199
why any showstopper

436
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,120
no that actually didn't discover

437
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,439
anything to block the project

438
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,159
because they were providing a mechanism

439
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,919
for users

440
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,000
to get dual steps in the unit

441
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,319
obviously your experience may vary

442
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,079
because it depends on the use cases and

443
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,799
devices from the network

444
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,520
for example my laptop has been

445
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,600
technologically network network

446
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,679
since the start of the pilot so for at

447
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,918
least two and a half years

448
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,080
and i'm perfectly happy but my use case

449
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,919
is both lessons agent browser

450
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,840
people with millions of applications

451
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,160
windows laptops might have different

452
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,120
experience

453
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,000
supportive impact surprisingly was very

454
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,760
little

455
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,520
but we planned ahead we notified the

456
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,320
users about the change

457
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,760
notification will contain the link to

458
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,559
report the issue

459
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,480
and the first step how to recover how to

460
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,399
switch the dual set

461
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,080
so as a result most of the users

462
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
actually didn't even need to talk to

463
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,080
support him

464
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,840
but in case they do support team were

465
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,720
provided with the troubleshooting flow

466
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,879
chart

467
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,400
they had a link to known issue page so

468
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,320
they could check if the issue has been

469
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,320
reported already on how to troubleshoot

470
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,480
lessons learned well the most

471
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,039
important lesson i've learned never

472
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,200
allow

473
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,360
your tech support to disable ipv6 of

474
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,160
user devices

475
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,039
we found a number of cases when users

476
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,200
just had ipv6 disabled on the laptops so

477
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,840
we'll see nothing not for that

478
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,640
white because a while ago it was some

479
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,678
issue

480
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,640
and tech support people decided as a

481
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,679
workaround

482
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,480
advise users or just disable atv6 once

483
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,640
you do this

484
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,120
there is no way you can come back find

485
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,960
out how many people did that

486
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,760
do they still had music disabled come

487
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,400
out until you turned off ipv4 and that

488
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,440
problem backfired

489
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,200
also until return of ipv4 you're not

490
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,160
really getting an operational experience

491
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,799
with v6

492
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,240
what you get it is hyper eyeballs and

493
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,720
it's completely different story all

494
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,200
right

495
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,679
we found a number of issues which were

496
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,760
not visible to us at all

497
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,600
thanks to high five vote until we

498
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,559
disable ipv4 right

499
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,199
first of all we found a lot of vendor

500
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,678
bug

501
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,080
very funny one i can talk for hours

502
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,799
probably should be another presentation

503
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,280
about what we found things like only

504
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,080
unique packets to particular

505
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,080
source of distillation porta broken and

506
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,399
all that kind of funny things

507
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,399
we actually found an interesting problem

508
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,360
with neighbor discovery design

509
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,280
neighbor discovery state machine allows

510
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,760
patients to be

511
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,520
dropped all the time when a new device

512
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,120
connected for the to the network for the

513
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,280
first few seconds

514
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,799
so there is an idea of a draft which is

515
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,320
going through working group plus call

516
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,158
currency to update the

517
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,000
neighbor discovery state machine and to

518
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,600
fix the issue

519
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,679
also there are a number of process

520
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,678
issues we discovered first of all indeed

521
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,080
in the mindset

522
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,840
people still think about ipv6 as a

523
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,039
second class citizen so they never have

524
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,199
physics connectivity

525
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,280
is before it's working and so on we

526
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,480
found the number of designs which

527
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,678
claimed to be ipv6 uh

528
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,799
enabled but they still had

529
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,360
number of dependencies on ipv4

530
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,520
like application might send ipv6 traffic

531
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,600
but it's never used in ipv6 dns for

532
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,120
example

533
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,199
so another lesson is that early adopters

534
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,199
are crucial for the success

535
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,640
so we did this opt-in phase when we

536
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,640
asked for volunteers

537
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,080
and it was a very good idea because we

538
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,799
got people on board

539
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,280
who are interested in physics willing to

540
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,360
try

541
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,440
willing to troubleshoot and they're also

542
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,799
capable of troubleshooting so they can

543
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
give you a which are much more

544
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,918
informative than just

545
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,840
something doesn't work right they can

546
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,720
help you they can run tp down for you

547
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,918
and so on

548
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,559
as a result when we switched majority of

549
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,000
the users to visit congress we already

550
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,840
uh had some issues found and fixed

551
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,159
which allowed us to minimize the user

552
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,158
impulse and improve the user experience

553
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,039
yeah another thing is that it's a very

554
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,000
good idea to start recreating

555
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,158
activities support from your vendor as

556
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,559
early as possible because obviously it

557
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,840
takes

558
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:41,360
years to get proper basic support but

559
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,480
that request must be very explicit

560
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,879
i've seen rfps say ipv6

561
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,679
must be supported it basically means

562
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,559
nothing

563
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,840
if you then tell you ah my equipment

564
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,158
supports ipv6

565
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,678
it most likely means you can configure

566
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,480
an ipv6 address

567
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
right it does it might not mean that

568
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,280
that device

569
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,200
can use ipv6 dns

570
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,879
it does not necessarily mean device

571
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,840
would receive dns and router

572
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,600
advertisement

573
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,760
it doesn't mean it could be managed over

574
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,480
ipv6 and so on right

575
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,080
so we start we have started making those

576
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,200
requirements explicit

577
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,600
and talking to all our vendors

578
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,520
so dedicated assets id why it's not

579
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,678
ideal

580
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,760
first of all we actually spent a lot of

581
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,799
time discussing

582
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,600
what the name of that ssid should be

583
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,918
our normal ssid is google guest how

584
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,240
should we name a fallback ssid

585
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,960
so the name is less attractive to users

586
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,600
still by default connect to google gas

587
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,679
but it's still attractive enough that if

588
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,320
google gets does not work

589
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:53,360
users will try this one hard right

590
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,840
also the problem is in most of the cases

591
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,678
people do not know which ssid the

592
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,918
device is connected to right now

593
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,320
because some devices have explicit

594
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,400
preferences some may

595
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,360
make a decision based on the signal and

596
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,440
so on

597
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,000
so we actually found the number of cases

598
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,000
when device which supposed to be on the

599
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,480
six on the ssid because it worked very

600
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,799
well

601
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,559
just decided to switch the dual steps

602
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,480
which basically increased in atu for

603
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,879
consumption and so on

604
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,080
so uh one of the options is actually do

605
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,320
not broadcast

606
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,399
the full brackets id so users need to

607
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,840
explicitly configure it only if they

608
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
need to

609
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,639
and also once your device remembers the

610
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,760
fallback society there's always a chance

611
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
it will be connected

612
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,879
to it even if someone is available and

613
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,360
working so it's hard

614
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,600
and for wired network fallback is

615
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,840
actually even harder because

616
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
for the guest network is just one

617
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,918
segment for us so we were

618
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,639
able to create additional dual stacks a

619
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,760
lot

620
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,159
but as i'm thinking about doing the same

621
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,520
uh migration for internal network when i

622
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,279
have a lot of villains

623
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,120
it means that i would need to double

624
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,720
number of villains in the network which

625
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,959
doesn't scale

626
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,120
so what we really need to make

627
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,559
transition to ipv6 only

628
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,918
smooth is ability for ipv6 only

629
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,678
and ipv4 enabled hots to coexist on the

630
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,440
same network segment on the same

631
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,559
villa and actually there is a draft

632
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
uh in adhd working group which is

633
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,559
currently with rxt editors and will be

634
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,159
published too we describe

635
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,600
how we can utilize dhtp with ipvd

636
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,000
mechanism to allow coexistence of ipv6

637
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,879
layer

638
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,880
physics only and ideal for enabled codes

639
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,919
together

640
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,360
so the current status of this

641
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,559
is that we have completed the migration

642
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,520
of our offices to icv6 on the network so

643
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,360
vast majority of them are now physics

644
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,760
only so when all this

645
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,320
convenience sanity is over and you

646
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,120
decide to comment here

647
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,840
in one of our locations your device will

648
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,840
be connected to ipv6 only guest network

649
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,440
so that's all i have for today

650
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,158
so believe me or not ipv6 all the

651
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,720
enterprise networks or maybe

652
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,840
let's call them ipv6 mostly enterprise

653
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,120
network

654
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,760
are actually possible and i guess now we

655
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:33,059
have time for questions

656
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,059
[Music]

657
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,200
uh thank you very much jen um somebody

658
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,760
is asking if you

659
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,000
enabled high availability on the nat 64

660
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:47,279
and dns-64 guest network and if so how

661
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,840
so uh actually for

662
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,679
for not 64 we're using the same devices

663
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,399
which we're using for normal not for

664
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,000
four

665
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,600
so it has the same level of high

666
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,320
availability because they will have a

667
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,240
cluster

668
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,639
of firewalls so the same set of devices

669
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,440
which vary initially even for not for

670
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,640
four mode

671
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,799
in high availability mode so we didn't

672
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,559
do anything special we basically enabled

673
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,600
additional form of not on the same set

674
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,480
of devices

675
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,080
and for data64 well i got like i was

676
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,600
using a google

677
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,678
uh public dns-64 so

678
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,199
it's because it's sweep and the whole

679
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,799
google infrastructure is provided

680
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,799
without high availability for us

681
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,320
someone is asking if the recording or

682
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,200
presentation will

683
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,200
uh will be made available this along

684
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
with all the other presentations will be

685
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,760
made available

686
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,760
a few weeks after the conference closes

687
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,400
we don't have any other questions but uh

688
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,559
jen i was wondering if you had

689
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,799
a favorite war story to share

690
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,120
i actually have two and i cannot make it

691
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:01,039
you can make my mind which i like more

692
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,600
so one was quite funny we noticed that

693
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,960
when i connect to the hex only network

694
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,080
which we did not even make

695
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,200
public at that state my device has

696
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,439
ipv6 connectivity for five seconds

697
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,640
and then it disappears until the next

698
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,720
array came

699
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,399
apparently what happened we had a smart

700
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,679
wireless device

701
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,439
which was trying to do kind of nd proxy

702
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,240
and it was pretty it was trying to

703
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,559
respond to neighbor solicitation from my

704
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,919
laptop for default router address

705
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:36,158
but while responding it was actually

706
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,080
clearing up rb in may which means

707
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,240
it was training my device i am not a

708
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,080
router anymore so my device was losing

709
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,360
default drain as a result of holistic

710
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,399
connectivity

711
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,520
after five seconds and the second funny

712
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,279
story was

713
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,760
michael complained that the respect

714
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,559
some of them are disappearing on v6 on

715
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,799
the network

716
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,158
and what we discovered the issue was

717
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,320
affected

718
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,240
you distributed with some particular

719
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,399
source for

720
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,240
and because different platforms using

721
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,879
different set of source ports for

722
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,840
dns packets it was only affecting some

723
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,320
platforms

724
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,279
and we found that another type of

725
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,520
equipment was

726
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,840
actually trying to drop

727
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:23,200
ipv6 mlg packets

728
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,000
and it was looking for item pv6

729
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,399
type in the packet without even checking

730
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,039
that it's actually 18 pv6

731
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,600
and as a result some source sports in

732
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,640
udp looked for that device as particular

733
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,520
icmp

734
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
ipv6 emergency package so those packets

735
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,559
were drawn

736
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,320
yes i spent some time at troubleshooting

737
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:47,440
that kind of many things

738
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,520
uh what was the most unexpected yet

739
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,559
positive feedback you've heard from the

740
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,559
v6 switchover

741
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,678
unexpected actually

742
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,760
i was surprised that how many people

743
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,520
actually responded to our announcement

744
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,120
saying oh yeah that's really cool thank

745
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,799
you very much for doing this

746
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,000
because we we did uh have some requests

747
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,279
from some developers

748
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,039
asking could you please give us the

749
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,080
ships on the network but i did not

750
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,320
expect that

751
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,080
so many engineers at least were actually

752
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,600
really happy to see it happening

753
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,840
because it actually allowed them to do

754
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,439
dog food and find out what kind of the

755
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,000
what kind of physics problems their

756
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:36,640
products have

757
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,640
well thank you very much john
