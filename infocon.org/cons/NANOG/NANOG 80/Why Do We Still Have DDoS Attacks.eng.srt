security panel

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,840
on ddos attacks we have

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,000
um of the most

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,080
expert people we could possibly have

widely dispersed across the globe here's

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,598

know um

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
but but many of you do our friend and

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,239
colleague don smith

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,160
passed away earlier this year and it was

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,360
a real deep loss and tragic for our

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,839
community

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,879
um he didn't attend many nanox but you

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,079
may have met him

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,039
uh online or more likely on email

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,399
and he was prolific for a long time in

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,399
his work with a quest

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,159
later centurylink and he just joined a

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,879
net scout not too long before he passed

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,080
away

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
so he's in our thoughts and we'll be

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
thinking about him um today

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,840
and for as long as as we have thoughts

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
we will miss him dearly

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,559
so with that let me introduce our

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,039

we have roland dobbins from netscout uh

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,280
damian venture from google and allison

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,279

um maybe you're all kind of located

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,600
across the globe i think

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,920
we have some folks from europe and asia

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,919

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,960
um so we'll start with you carol if you

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
just say hi

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,320
about 30 seconds and maybe briefly

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,479
introduce yourself sure yeah

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,679
hello everyone my name is kyle bitter

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,840
i've become sort of

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,719
by sort of accident the sort of point

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
man for

59
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,719
anything detox related when uh when we

60
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
get attacked again

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,399
so i've over the years built up a fair

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,039
amount of experience in dealing with

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,878
them

64
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,958
even though i'm not that much of a

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,840
network technical person myself

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,360
i know just about enough about it to get

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,400
the people who actually know about it

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,760
involved and get started fix things

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
i think we could all say roughly the

70
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,280
equivalent thing roland

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,200
hi i'm roland dobbins with uh now scout

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,959
i'm a network engineer by trade

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,958
but got kind of got pulled into the

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,560
whole ddos thing about a quarter of a

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,160
century ago because when you

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
design and build and run networks you

77
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,680
also need to keep them

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
up and running hopefully and available

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
quarter century that's about when they

80
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,000
started i don't know is that a

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,280
coincidence or not we'll see

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
damian did you salem yeah uh damian

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,280
metra had

84
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,840
been at google for uh 15 years now

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
and been responsible for ddos mitigation

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
at google

87
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
for basically the entire time it was

88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,599
there um

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,440
now we're sort of expanding from

90
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,720
defending ourselves from attacks to also

91
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,920
defending the rest of the world from

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,640
outbound attacks from our cloud

93
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,679
customers

94
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,799
so it's been an interesting journey

95
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
we all appreciate that allison hi my

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,959
name is alison nixon i'm the chief

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,000
research officer at unit 220

98
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,000
sorry unit 221b um i've

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,840
i'm more on the investigative side i've

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,799
been looking at threat actor communities

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,159
and

102
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,720
all the different kinds of attacks that

103
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,079
they do and that includes ddos

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,920
as well as fraud and other things okay

105
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,200
well welcome again to all of you

106
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,040
and i think two of you if i'm not

107
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,560
mistaken uh carol and allison is this

108
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,319
would be your technique your first nano

109
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,879
that you've been participating in

110
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,518
is a true statement i'm not sure maybe

111
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
maybe okay well welcome nonetheless and

112
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,519
i know damian roland have

113
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,359
both been involved in the past so uh in

114
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,680
about 60 seconds or less

115
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,920
the first shot out of the canon and uh

116
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,200
again i'll go in the same order

117
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,559
tell tell us of the audience

118
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,920
and perhaps the most memorable

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,799
or perhaps uh an event

120
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
related to ddos attacks uh for you in

121
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,959
your career you don't have to describe

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,799
the whole attack or

123
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
in detail but what what is it when you

124
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
think about ddos text what

125
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,918
sort of strikes in your memory about

126
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,759
memorable events carol

127
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,479
for me that would be the the series of

128
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,680
attacks in 2013 where um

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,280
something that i never thought i would

130
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,560
do in my life was make the front page of

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,440
new york times

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
and that that made that happen and i i

133
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,479
don't think i'll be able to top it

134
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,320
anytime soon

135
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,599
i hope not really well this probably

136
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,520
takes us back to

137
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,199
uh the economic doldrums back in 2001

138
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,359
after the

139
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,720
two subject or eleventh attacks in early

140
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,440
2002

141
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,919
i was working with a very large vendor

142
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,840
of

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,359
telecommunications gear and was publicly

144
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,280
traded and

145
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,280
towards the end of their fiscal year the

146
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,239
last week the last quarter of their

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,159
fiscal year

148
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
they came under a very intense ddos

149
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,600
attack and

150
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,758
you know no positive evidence to to to

151
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,120
demonstrate this but my belief then and

152
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,960
now was that it was an attempt to

153
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,919
manipulate the stock markets

154
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,520
and potentially cause cause that

155
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,240
organization to miss its numbers which

156
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,359
would have had

157
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,960
huge huge effects on the u.s economy

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,840
that was in the doldrums at that time

159
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
and so

160
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,280
fighting a bunch of ddos attacks for

161
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,800
about a week feeling a

162
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,880
you know substantive weight of the us

163
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,240
economy on your soldiers shoulders is

164
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,280
kind of an eye-opener

165
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,280
in many respects

166
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,720
that's noteworthy that you still don't

167
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,720
necessarily have the total

168
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
attribution or reason behind that what

169
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,000
you damien

170
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,320
it's it's really hard to pick just one

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
um and a lot of the more interesting

172
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,880
ones i'm

173
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,080
not actually at liberty to talk about

174
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,479
they haven't been made public

175
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,840
but i i think as a general guide the

176
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,800
ones that are interesting to me

177
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,400
are when we see an attack that is twice

178
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,120
as large as anything the world has ever

179
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,359
seen

180
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
and then a day or two later it grows and

181
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
doubles in size again so now it's four

182
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,198
times larger than anything anyone has

183
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,120
seen

184
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,720
and i think i've seen that behavior

185
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
happen two or three times

186
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,800
um in the past decade so it sort of

187
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,199
shows how quickly these things can't

188
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,840
escalate

189
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,319
and allison last but not least yeah

190
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
there is

191
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
a number of memorable attacks that have

192
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,039
happened involving ddos

193
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,520
i guess one of them would be a few years

194
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,159
ago this dns provider called dyn was

195
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,680
attacked

196
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,800
and it took down a bunch of websites

197
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
and i know that people like right when

198
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
the attack happened

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
people were going on tv and blaming

200
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,319
russia and china and north korea

201
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
and we were looking at the evidence and

202
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,440
we were actually

203
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,960
looking at some like script kitty groups

204
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,000
that people don't take seriously and

205
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,159
they were the ones actually

206
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
responsible for that and then when that

207
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,039
word got out

208
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,400
we ended up getting inundated with calls

209
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,120
from the media and it was really

210
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,440
exhausting

211
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
but uh quite satisfying that we were

212
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
able to find the answer

213
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,000
so yeah good times yeah

214
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
you are participating some of my

215
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,680
follow-up questions now i was going to

216
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,479
start with you first allison if i could

217
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,039
so um at least going back a quarter

218
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,960
century

219
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,680
as roland was there from the beginning

220
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,840
uh maybe before most of us or all of us

221
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,440
um many of the the motivations for these

222
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,719
attacks vary

223
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,960
um the the the reason

224
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
for them might be retaliation or protest

225
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,520
or extortion those sorts of things

226
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
um they're very you know what they

227
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,758
consist

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
of the the packets the protocols the you

229
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,560
know the context

230
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,120
of the the traffic itself um varies

231
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,639
widely

232
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,800
but who else who today

233
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,400
would you say if you could name one or a

234
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
small subset of groups that are

235
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,799
responsible for attacks today and why

236
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,800
are they

237
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
why do we why are we seeing them today

238
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,440
what's the motivation behind them what's

239
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,840
the driving

240
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,759
i mean i think every single motivation

241
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,799
could be the explaining factor for

242
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,800
a lot of the attacks happening nowadays

243
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,039
i wouldn't say that there was any one

244
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
particular group or region responsible

245
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,919
for

246
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,720
a majority of ddos attacks like every

247
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,639
region

248
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,199
out there has its own criminal element

249
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
and there's an entire ddos ecosystem

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,560
that's part of that criminal element so

251
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,239
i mean

252
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
my focus has been on the english

253
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,199
speaking community because i only speak

254
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,440
english right

255
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
so when i look at the english speaking

256
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,560
side of things

257
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,160
i see a lot of ego motivation as well as

258
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,000
monetary motivation

259
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,599
so a lot of these guys are out there

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,919
trying to prove themselves

261
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,360
and there's like some kind of insatiable

262
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,559
ego need that's never going to be

263
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
satisfied because it's

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,958
actually a personal problem they have

265
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,598
and some of these ddos botnets

266
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,679
are used to attack high profile targets

267
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,920
explicitly to get media attention

268
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,599
so that's something that i've seen over

269
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,800
and over again with the english speaking

270
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
western community

271
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,399
but if you look at other criminal

272
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,040
communities overseas

273
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,399
like in russia and china and some of the

274
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,319
eastern european countries

275
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,080
um you see a lot of like a whole

276
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,279
variation of motivations and a lot more

277
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,200
financial motivation going on

278
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,680
it's like the sources of the texts

279
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,000
themselves those motivations and reasons

280
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,279
are

281
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,920
as distributed if anyone wants to follow

282
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,000
up

283
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
um please do otherwise i'll i'll move on

284
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,279
so go ahead let me just add in

285
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
there in addition to the financial

286
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,680
motivations um we've also seen

287
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
politically motivated attacks um so an

288
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,560
example would be

289
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,240
the brobot attacks on u.s banks in

290
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,518
i think that was 2012 2013 time frame

291
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,000
and the great canon attacks

292
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,320
targeting for example github and i think

293
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,519
that was 2015.

294
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
right and the university environment

295
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,160
we've seen politically motivated

296
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,360
uh style sorts of attacks or went to the

297
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,240
social

298
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,560
sort of uh societal issues as well sure

299
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,800
and you know the the direct extortion

300
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,719
obviously things like stock market

301
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,399
manipulation from time to time

302
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,160
we see ddos attacks used as a

303
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
distraction to distract

304
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,880
an organization's security team while uh

305
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,399
threat actor is trying to exfiltrate

306
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
you know valuable information

307
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
intellectual property or financial

308
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,760
information

309
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,319
or what have you and as far as i can

310
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,360
tell

311
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,200
just by the numbers something like 90 or

312
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,880
more of ddos attacks by the numbers

313
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,800
appear to be motivated

314
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,800
by disputes related to online gaming

315
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,079
and a huge proportion of those attacks

316
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,719
tend to fall

317
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,719
on broadband access networks a lot of it

318
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,959
has to do with inter-game rivalry but it

319
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,240
also ties into organized crime

320
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,199
because there's a tremendous amount of

321
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,640
betting that goes on related to online

322
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,880
gaming and so

323
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,640
people will ddos teams to to get them to

324
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,000
help hopefully drop out of the game and

325
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,920
lose the game and

326
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
and then they can collect money because

327
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,000
they bet on the other players

328
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,720
we've had instances of players in actual

329
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,320
organized

330
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,160
esports events um have them their team

331
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,120
ddosed and so that they could throw the

332
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,360
game

333
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
essentially and and get paid off on the

334
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
back so

335
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
all these motivations uh plus the

336
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,519
nihilism and the prestige stuff that

337
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,880
uh that allison talked about as well

338
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
you're foreshadowing another question

339
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,680
ahead maybe i'll just get to it now

340
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,440
ninety percent what is that measure is

341
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,279
that the number of actual individual

342
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,040
attacks is that some amount

343
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,800
of volume how do you actually measure

344
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,040
this is i'm kind of looking at both you

345
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,479
and and damien although you can't tell

346
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,319
um on this how do you

347
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,720
monitor or measure an attack how do you

348
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
determine the size

349
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,000
or the number you you want to go

350
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,120
firsthand

351
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,800
uh sure i can give a brief overview so

352
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,720
there are different metrics to measure

353
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,199
attacks by so what's often seen in the

354
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
news

355
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,880
is people are measuring how many

356
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,480
gigabits was an attack

357
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,560
and these days now we're measuring in

358
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
terabits but it's also important to

359
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,518
measure

360
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
uh packet rates you know if if you have

361
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,720
an attack that's

362
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,920
you know 100 million packets per second

363
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,639
that's going to create a different

364
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,079
bottleneck

365
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,760
in your system if those are small

366
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,920
packets than the bandwidth

367
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,040
and then for those of us who operate

368
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,240
websites

369
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,399
um we're often more focused on

370
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,160
the request rate to the website so how

371
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,440
many http gets per second

372
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,120
do you get um and so each of these need

373
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
to be measured independently and tracked

374
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,200
independently

375
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,519
there are obviously other measures to

376
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,040
consider as well depending on what your

377
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,480
your constraints are but the

378
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
challenge that we often see in

379
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,200
measurements is that

380
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,920
if you did not successfully mitigate the

381
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
attack

382
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,199
then you probably don't actually know

383
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,560
how large it was um

384
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
so you know if for example if you say

385
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,119
that

386
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,000
an attack saturated you know if you have

387
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,000
a 100 gigabit link to the internet and

388
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,440
it's saturated your 100 gigabit link

389
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,320
you don't actually know if that attack

390
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,959
was 101 gigabits or a terabit

391
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,800
and so that's that's a challenge where

392
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,319
uh the the numbers that we're seeing now

393
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,240
are basically only

394
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,600
uh produced by the largest players who

395
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,079
are actually capable of making those

396
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
measurements

397
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,680
yeah and and to add to what damian said

398
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,440
you know bandwidth

399
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
is what you hear about throughput which

400
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,480
is package per second

401
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,319
very very important connections per

402
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,040
second queries per second request per

403
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
second

404
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,399
all these different types of metrics of

405
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,920
different different

406
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,560
parts of the stack from our standpoint

407
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,279
we get anonymous ddos anonymized

408
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,680
statistics

409
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,439
that are shared with us from a lot of

410
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,040
organizations and so

411
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
like right now the run rate that we're

412
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,639
seeing is something like 30 000 distinct

413
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,120
attacks a day

414
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,880
is what we're seeing right now and that

415
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,079
includes you know compound attacks that

416
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,639
have multiple vectors

417
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,319
multi-vector attacks omni-vector attacks

418
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,000
all that sort of thing and so

419
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,839
um telemetry of various sorts and having

420
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
uh as damian said the correct

421
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,000
topological perspective

422
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,320
or being able to assemble viewpoints

423
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,240
from various topological perspectives is

424
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,399
is very important something else that

425
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,680
needs to be understood is that

426
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,440
most ddos attacks are vastly vastly

427
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,079
overkill it's like using a nuclear

428
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,320
weapon

429
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
to swat a fly because so many of the

430
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
targets

431
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,680
are brittle and fragile and non-scalable

432
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
and just breathing a few packets over

433
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,519
them

434
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,760
can actually take them down and so

435
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,680
some some a lot of the time when you

436
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,040
will read pressing accounts of

437
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,719
you know some organization they say oh

438
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,839
and you know we get we're hit by a very

439
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,519
sophisticated

440
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
you know high bandwidth high throughput

441
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,079
attack was bigger than anything that's

442
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,160
ever seen but

443
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,239
been seen before and obviously it was a

444
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,000
state sponsored actor well you have to

445
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,160
take that with a grain of salt sometimes

446
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,120
because it used to be the organizations

447
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,639
would never ever admit publicly if their

448
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,920
services were affected

449
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,120
by a ddos attack now ddos attacks

450
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,360
have become the go-to um to to

451
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,480
to blame for all kinds of outages that

452
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,959
may or may not

453
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,360
be deliberately uh related to a to an

454
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,599
actual intentional ddos attack

455
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,199
i would trust if i don't want to belabor

456
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,480
this topic for too much longer about

457
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,399
real quick though

458
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
i would trust all of you to provide

459
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,600
reasonably good metrics

460
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,120
on what you see but i would assume

461
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,199
that's probably

462
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,320
in many cases or maybe all cases it's a

463
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,319
minimum you get some anonymized

464
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,760
statistics but you don't get all

465
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,680
you don't get contributing for everybody

466
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,399
so you get some low bar

467
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,439
of traffic is it do some organizations

468
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,560
um

469
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,519
um over uh sell what they actually see

470
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,279
like do they say

471
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959
they claim attacks that are larger than

472
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,760
what they actually have happened and how

473
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,279
did

474
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,959
i assume that that happens some

475
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,720
sometimes how does that how does that

476
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,719
occur how does someone overestimate or

477
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,959
over report what they actually have

478
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,079
i'll go first and then if that's okay so

479
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,638
in many cases

480
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,399
um we see overestimation done when

481
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,839
organizations have the capability like

482
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,880
they're exporting flow telemetry from

483
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,639
their routers

484
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,079
but they have the flow export

485
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,720
configuration of the router

486
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,758
misconfigured and or their collection

487
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,279
analysis

488
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,880
system that they're using is

489
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,199
misconfigured and so

490
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,560
we'll see over reporting um you know if

491
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
they're using other type forms of

492
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,599
telemetry snmp what have you they'll

493
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,160
have counter wrap

494
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
or or these types of things and and so

495
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,360
that is

496
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,880
a motivation uh or not a motivation that

497
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
is an explanation

498
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,040
for inadvertent um overstatement

499
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,199
sometimes

500
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,639
motivation might be that they want to

501
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,519
oversell and say how great they are

502
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,519
defending it i presume

503
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,040
sometimes other times we see

504
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,040
organizations

505
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,560
end up getting hit by attacks that quite

506
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,599
frankly if they

507
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,479
had um you know a a reasonable

508
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,480
uh internet security posture with

509
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,000
reasonable degree of resilience

510
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,920
they wouldn't normally have been

511
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,160
affected and so

512
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,680
we'll see sometimes some exaggeration

513
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,920
whether deliberate or inadvertent i'll

514
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,160
have to leave it other to judge

515
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,360
but it seems as if perhaps they're

516
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,199
trying to

517
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,199
overstate the severity the

518
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,079
sophistication of the attack

519
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,800
in order to perhaps make up for the fact

520
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,120
that it

521
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,160
uh with a little bit more preparation

522
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,759
that they might have been able to

523
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,160
withstand it and that that's the number

524
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,000
one reason that ddos attacks succeed

525
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,279
is due to the lack of preparedness of

526
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,839
the defender

527
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,720
okay i can move on to my next question

528
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,839
it was for

529
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,400
directed to you carol um one of the

530
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,119
things

531
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,959
and this of course had to come up is one

532
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,599
of the things that seems to

533
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,000
plague us since the beginning is is the

534
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,719
ability

535
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,760
for some networks to be able to source

536
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,679
address spoof

537
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,679
and that may have not been behind some

538
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,120
of the attacks that you've experienced

539
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,480
um there's been long number of

540
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,000
talks and and posts on lists and people

541
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
is claiming about how we need to solve

542
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,960
this problem get everyone to put in

543
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
their end date spliffing filters and do

544
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,160
all this source

545
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,840
validation stuff but 25 years and

546
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,799
counting we don't seem to be completely

547
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,399
all the way there and

548
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
you know one might conclude maybe we

549
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,480
will never be um

550
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,919
so maybe instead um there's been some

551
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,000
anecdotal evidence that

552
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,960
it's not all the networks who are

553
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,240
capable of allowing sourced

554
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,760
addresses out of the network that are

555
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
actually conducting these attacks it

556
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,000
seems to be a small subset of them that

557
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,199
are actually

558
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,960
facilitating them is would it be better

559
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,360
or were we worth shining a light on

560
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,520
those specific networks that seem to be

561
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,000
facilitating these attacks um

562
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,000
specifically

563
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,600
and i'm going to go about doing that

564
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
yeah that uh i i think that would

565
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,039
definitely

566
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,400
uh definitely help it's it's um from

567
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,440
from the experience that i've had it's

568
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
definitely true that

569
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,000
that there's um uh often there's when

570
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
there's proof traffic involved uh

571
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
yeah you can you can you can trace it

572
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
back to

573
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,520
to if you can trace back i mean this is

574
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,240
a big event that's a problem by itself

575
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,720
is that it

576
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,760
often takes too much time and and too

577
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,120
much effort

578
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,320
and and too much uh uh

579
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,000
this is depending on you know

580
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,200
who's being attacked and who they know

581
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
to be able to figure out where it's

582
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,520
coming from

583
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,760
if you're talking about tracing back to

584
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,600
spoof traffic i'm sure that damien has

585
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,360
plenty of stories about that um

586
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,879
it's not always easy for everyone to

587
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,280
figure it out and and

588
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,799
it's in in the past it's been easier for

589
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,840
me to figure it out because people that

590
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,720
i know and i can

591
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,280
go on to to slack channels or whatnot

592
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,919
and

593
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,520
and have access to people who can help

594
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,720
out in that regard pretty quickly but

595
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
obviously that's not the case for

596
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,840
everyone

597
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,439
and and i think that's one of the bigger

598
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
problems that is holding it back is that

599
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,039
it's often

600
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,720
it takes way too long to to figure out

601
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,080
where it's coming from

602
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,360
and uh once you figure that out it is

603
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,360
surprisingly sometimes really

604
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,399
surprisingly hard to get

605
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,439
other you know upstream or or other

606
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
people involved

607
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,440
somewhere in the path to say okay yeah

608
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,559
we we agree that this is bad and we're

609
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,160
going to do something about

610
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,799
it and that that in the end that that is

611
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,120
i think why this is still why this still

612
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,120
exists

613
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,280
who don't care about it maybe i'll ask

614
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,639
allison because she has some experience

615
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,600
in the attribution angle

616
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,240
does is this is this an approach that

617
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,719
kind of work

618
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,679
is is fine if we can identify the

619
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,320
sources of these

620
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,760
networks um naming them attributing them

621
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,918
and then specifically targeting them in

622
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,480
some way is this a worthwhile exercise

623
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,440
yes

624
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,120
so uh when you're talking about fighting

625
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,799
the ddos problem you need to have

626
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,639
multiple different efforts going on in

627
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,080
parallel part of it is arresting the

628
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,799
third actors themselves

629
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,639
and part of it is also pointing some

630
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,520
scrutiny at these networks that are

631
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,760
either

632
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,520
neglectful or complicit or somehow

633
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,280
facilitating these cdos attacks and

634
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,000
providing the infrastructure in order to

635
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
do that

636
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,520
um there are some techniques that will

637
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,918
actually allow you

638
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,520
to find the source of the ddos attack

639
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,000
but for the most part you're only going

640
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,918
to get

641
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,840
a resolution like you're only going to

642
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,280
get a granularity down to the service

643
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,720
provider responsible

644
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,879
so when it comes to applying pressure or

645
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,600
doing other things to get them to stop

646
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,600
sending pollution to the internet

647
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,719
that is something that we're all looking

648
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,240
into and

649
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,679
hopefully this is something that can

650
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,679
increase over the next year or two

651
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,720
i want to mention like i gave a talk at

652
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,159
a previous nanog about how to do this

653
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,760
traceback and

654
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,240
you know the the fact that transit

655
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,158
providers are able to stop all of this

656
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,520
um if they wanted to right they have to

657
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,440
be convinced that it's

658
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,879
in their business interest to stop these

659
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,640
amplification attacks

660
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,919
um but it's also important to keep in

661
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,559
mind that there are multiple types of

662
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,039
botnet

663
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,600
you know types of attacks so even if we

664
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,679
do

665
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,520
you know source address validation and

666
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,520
solve that problem completely there will

667
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,240
still be botnets of iot devices out

668
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,760
there

669
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,960
so it's not a complete solution and i

670
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,960
think it's important to keep that in

671
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,240
mind that there are multiple

672
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,320
types of attacks you

673
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,600
you people are really good anticipating

674
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,280
questions that i have the audience

675
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,320
should know i have not

676
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
given them the questions i was

677
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,120
specifically going to ask just some

678
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,320
general themes or topics but i was going

679
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,840
to ask one of the next questions to you

680
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,760
damon was

681
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,199
um i don't know that we necessarily

682
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,879
include google as a

683
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,679
as a um as a backbone provider per se so

684
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,000
whether we do or not um doesn't actually

685
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,080
matter

686
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,919
but my question to you is what is it

687
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,480
that the backbone providers that

688
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
the transit carrier specifically those

689
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,400
um

690
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,000
you know if you can think of the center

691
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
of the internet if there's such a thing

692
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,919
what is it that they

693
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,280
um ought to be doing or could do how

694
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,280
could they be helping us do this because

695
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,760
you often hear a lot of times as

696
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,039
is their transiting traffic they don't

697
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,640
really know about an attack until they

698
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,720
get contacted by somebody because they

699
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,240
have so much capacity it almost

700
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,840
doesn't register on their radar

701
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,720
and so they don't maybe necessarily have

702
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,918
an incentive or even

703
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,200
the insight to know that this is a

704
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,120
particular problem what should they be

705
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,200
doing if anything

706
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,158
so a simple thing would be to look at

707
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,520
their

708
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,799
flow data um so you know presumably for

709
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,000
you know whatever purposes either

710
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,760
managing their network or billing

711
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,960
purposes they're collecting some level

712
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,200
of flow data

713
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,640
uh from all of their peering links to

714
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,960
their customers

715
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,400
and if they look at that flow data they

716
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,440
will see that there are certain

717
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
interfaces

718
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,840
that are completely dominated by um

719
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,039
traffic that is you know udp uh

720
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,959
you know ntp traffic only you know it's

721
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,720
like 100 ntp or 100

722
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,840
dns or maybe it's 100 sins

723
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,559
and if they look at the source addresses

724
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
on those

725
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,158
their router will tell them what is the

726
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,400
source as

727
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,360
if they see a single interface that is

728
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,679
sourcing

729
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,399
a thousand asses and it's not a peering

730
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,080
exchange or a pure transit provider

731
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,520
then that's extremely suspicious right

732
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,720
there there aren't very many customers

733
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,918
who have a cone

734
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,520
of a thousand asses so this is mostly a

735
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,360
matter of just being able to

736
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,360
look at their flow data and then take

737
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,559
action on what they find

738
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,559
okay sounds like a very good image

739
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,320
yeah so so what damian's saying is

740
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,679
correct um float telemetry

741
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,918
at all the edges of the network where

742
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,039
packets ingress the network collecting

743
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,400
and analyzing at

744
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,158
there's tons of open source tools

745
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
there's tons of commercial tools that

746
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,919
allow that to happen

747
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,039
a big problem that we have is number one

748
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,120
a lot of networks

749
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,720
simply even in this day and age they

750
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,239
don't have flow telemetry deployed at

751
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
the edge right so that that's problem

752
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,039
number one

753
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,120
problem number two is even if

754
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,799
organizations do in fact

755
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,959
have flow telemetry exported from their

756
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,440
edges and they have some kind of system

757
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,640
to collect and analyze that flow

758
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,679
telemetry

759
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,320
the having the skills and experience

760
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,159
and understanding the importance of

761
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,320
being able to do this

762
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,840
is not nearly as widely distributed as

763
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,000
we would like it to be

764
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:35,120
in point in fact the the people who have

765
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,480
the skills experience and motivation

766
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,760
and ability to to perform trace back on

767
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,039
networks

768
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,400
on the internet as a whole is relatively

769
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,120
small it always has been and it still is

770
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
to this day and so this is something

771
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,760
that is a perennial problem

772
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,279
and even if a a particular organization

773
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
has some people who are in the position

774
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,600
to do that

775
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,199
they have the tools and the technology

776
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,120
they perform trace back

777
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,720
their ability to perform traceback of

778
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,120
course ends

779
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,279
at their at the the border of their

780
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,559
network there is limited to their span

781
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,799
of administrative control

782
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,799
and so doing this you know multi-hop by

783
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,279
multi-hop by multi-hop

784
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,320
ms carol had indicated earlier can be

785
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,640
very tedious

786
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,960
and and time consuming it's a difficult

787
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,400
problem it's a skill set problem it's

788
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,320
it's uh the technology is there but

789
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,159
it you know it always can be improved

790
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,399
but the main thing

791
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,840
is is the motivation to understand it

792
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,960
and even though

793
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,799
back in the earlies we would have isps

794
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
who deliberately did nothing

795
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,080
about ddos traffic whether it was

796
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
spoofed or it was non-spoof because they

797
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,000
were making money

798
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,440
billing for that traffic we had a period

799
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,840
starting in the early aughts

800
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,600
to the mid teens where there was greater

801
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,520
awareness and we didn't have that

802
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,039
but i've been running into that again

803
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,200
recently working

804
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,879
with some organizations to try and get

805
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,720
some attacks traced back

806
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,320
where because of the current economic

807
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,880
situation that we're in

808
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,120
that some operators are not necessarily

809
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,240
as highly motivated as one would like

810
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,479
to trace back smooth traffic and attack

811
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,360
traffic that's not targeting them

812
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,840
directly

813
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,559
or their infrastructure directly and

814
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,199
that's a

815
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,000
again a perennial problem so one thing

816
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
about the

817
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,240
experience and expertise in order to

818
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,600
trace back traffic and prevent ddos

819
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,360
attacks

820
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,199
i mean when we're dealing with ddos this

821
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,559
is an ever growing problem and it always

822
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,279
will be the numbers will always get

823
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,158
bigger

824
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,679
and i seem to remember a few years ago

825
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,240
quite a number of networks that

826
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,559
normally would ordinarily say they don't

827
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
have the ability to do this or that

828
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,480
suddenly gained that ability when

829
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,400
memcached hit the scene and the outbound

830
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,720
attacks were taking down the network

831
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,679
sending those attacks and then all of a

832
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,279
sudden

833
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,279
a lot of expertise came out of the

834
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,840
woodwork very quickly i was very

835
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,760
impressed

836
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,959
that's true and that that goes back to

837
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,879
the motivation

838
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,880
our you know our organization's

839
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,960
motivated to do something

840
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,640
that is not necessarily benefiting them

841
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,640
directly but is benefiting

842
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,320
the internet as a whole or do or do they

843
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
only really step up to the plate

844
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,480
when they are directly affected that's

845
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,320
an excellent point alice

846
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,679
eva my next question was actually for

847
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,320
you roland so if you need a quick drink

848
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,080
of water go ahead and take it

849
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,399
this is in the tool and i guess in the

850
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,760
tools in the the mitigation solution

851
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,120
theme uh ddos mitigation providers

852
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,080
this is something a lot of people

853
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,039
particularly in the industry of

854
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,240
universities

855
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,520
um have large bills

856
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,200
where they they'll pay for service that

857
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,720
rivals their internet connectivity in

858
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,240
many cases

859
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,640
what are these things how do they work

860
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,159
and who needs them

861
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,039
sure so there are basically two

862
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,720
uh i guess two and a half forms of ddos

863
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,960
mitigation capabilities that you see

864
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,880
broadly speaking you see organic on

865
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,919
network us mitigation capabilities where

866
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,679
an organization

867
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,200
has its own ability to detect and

868
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,360
classify and trace back

869
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,279
and mitigate ddos attacks and then you

870
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,000
see

871
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,000
the the mitigation service providers

872
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,240
sometimes those services are provided

873
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,600
by the upstream transit providers who

874
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,919
sell transit

875
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,439
to those those organizations and so they

876
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,200
can also

877
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,960
mitigate the the attack traffic and then

878
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,919
there are also overlay providers

879
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,279
who may be topologically distant uh from

880
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,399
the organizations that they're

881
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,559
protecting

882
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,399
but who also have the ability to divert

883
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,200
traffic going to those organizations and

884
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,039
then

885
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,559
clean out the drop the bad traffic on

886
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,200
the floor and then re-inject the good

887
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,200
traffic

888
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,320
and it's typically done uh via routing

889
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,240
via bgp

890
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,639
you can also do some things with dns as

891
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,919
well but typically you want to to use

892
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,559
bgp

893
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,320
in order to do this and so there is

894
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,639
typically when you're talking about an

895
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,399
off net solution an upstream solution

896
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
there is a degree of setup that's

897
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,080
required and you know just to be able

898
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,840
for example to provide the letter of

899
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,559
authorization that allows

900
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,678
a managed security service provider to

901
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,639
provide

902
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,240
mitigation service by diverting you know

903
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,279
announcing your bgp routes i think

904
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,520
there's a minimum

905
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,480
like a 72 hour you know 32 business hour

906
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,080
turnaround

907
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,640
typically for getting that done

908
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,720
irrespective of the other things and so

909
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,880
what we see is some some organizations

910
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,279
just say okay i'm going to outsource it

911
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,240
we've seen especially here in asia some

912
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,840
of the financial

913
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,679
um online financial you know oriented

914
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,120
organizations like banks and stock

915
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,159
exchanges some of those

916
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,559
actually pay for 24x7 upstream

917
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
mitigation because they don't want to

918
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,678
experience they want to minimize any

919
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,039
downtime that they experience and they

920
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,520
want to outsource it all

921
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,279
other organizations you know do it all

922
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,639
themselves and only reach out

923
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,960
when they need help and so there's a

924
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,000
variety of ways that this is done

925
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,159
and a variety of like you said of uh

926
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,159
levels of investment and pricing and

927
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,440
that's involved in many cases

928
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,919
with with the deployments sort of um

929
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,240
ramping up with origin validation when

930
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,360
you're using the rpki

931
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,840
is that causing any problems that you've

932
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,918
seen

933
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,840
any of you for for doing this ddos

934
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,840
mitigation using pgp

935
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,120
not yet for me we're keeping yeah

936
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,199
we're keeping our eye on it obviously

937
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,479
and it's it's very important rpki is

938
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,080
extremely important

939
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,480
um and we want to see that rolled out

940
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,760
universally right and to help fight

941
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,320
uh the the risk of of bgp hijacking and

942
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,440
so

943
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,918
it's very important that we make sure

944
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,480
that providers who are doing ddos

945
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,600
mitigation and doing bgp based diversion

946
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,360
are in fact doing everything required to

947
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,158
implement our pki

948
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,840
uh so that they can um divert those

949
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,120
prefixes that they have permission to do

950
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,158
so in that scene

951
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,520
you know in the rpki infrastructure

952
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,960
it's pretty worth highlighting you know

953
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,679
the reason we're so interested in our

954
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,840
pki

955
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,520
is you know bgp hijacks are another form

956
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,639
of dos it's not a ddos it's

957
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,879
very different from everything we've

958
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,080
looked at but we've also experienced

959
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,399
outages because of

960
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:07,279
those types of events yeah interesting

961
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,158
carol what what um from a customer

962
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,240
perspective

963
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,440
if i could classify spanish i think as a

964
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,000
customer more or less

965
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,880
of uh network services um for like the

966
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,159
scrubbing and

967
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,080
those sorts of things like the ddos

968
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,000
mitigation services what do customers

969
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,840
need to know about this sort of stuff

970
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,720
before spending a lot of money on

971
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,799
someone

972
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,960
scrubbing your traffic helping you

973
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,039
deliver traffic

974
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,000
um well definitely one of the things

975
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,279
that that role mentioned earlier is

976
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,159
there's a lot to be gained if you're

977
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,640
prepared uh in in a good manner there's

978
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,960
the

979
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,240
i think more than half of the match is

980
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,559
making sure that you

981
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,360
know you can be attacked where you can

982
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,039
be attacked

983
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,879
what sort of things to expect because

984
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,960
that'll that'll definitely inform

985
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,320
how you're going to deal with any any

986
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,279
sort of mitigation that you

987
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,080
might acquire or buy or rent or spend

988
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,640
money on or

989
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,480
even time and resources on um another

990
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,519
thing i think that's important to

991
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,240
to to spend some time on

992
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,960
is is figuring out what what normal

993
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,840
traffic look

994
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,840
looks like and

995
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,640
something that we run into every now and

996
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,080
then is that you know

997
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,760
one of the things that we have we have

998
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,799
many servers at many different

999
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,360
isps all over the world and

1000
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,639
most of them will get a fairly you know

1001
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,039
good number of dns

1002
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,880
queries on a regular basis because

1003
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,320
that's the normal traffic but

1004
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,840
um almost on a probably not a weekly

1005
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,960
basis but certainly monthly basis will

1006
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,720
get alarms from

1007
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,559
one of these places saying we think

1008
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,240
you're under ddos no this is our normal

1009
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,600
traffic this is just you know we get a

1010
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,519
lot of dns queries

1011
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,199
other people get a lot of other traffic

1012
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,240
we just got a lot of dns and just the

1013
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,080
fact that we're getting a couple of

1014
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,120
thousands of queries on on one machine

1015
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,199
per second

1016
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,879
is is not really for us that's not a

1017
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,799
concern that's just normal

1018
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
but they have something in place that

1019
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,840
will that will award

1020
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,320
to alert someone that you know this is

1021
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,199
an attack this is this is not normal

1022
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,240
um so i guess that that you you sort of

1023
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,840
you need to know what

1024
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,360
what your normal situation is because

1025
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,760
that'll obviously also

1026
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,719
um you know play a part in when you want

1027
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,039
to raise the alarms

1028
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,080
let me ask this question to all of you

1029
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,799
and if you i think

1030
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,760
are able or if you're willing to to feel

1031
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,918
that

1032
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,080
um i've noticed this myself no doubt

1033
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,720
that all of you have as well

1034
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,720
especially when an attack is ongoing and

1035
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,440
it's significant enough to

1036
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,200
be noticed by lots of people reports and

1037
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,320
the press start to go out maybe the tech

1038
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,640
press but sometimes

1039
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,639
you know national media global media and

1040
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,000
oftentimes that press isn't so great at

1041
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,600
describing what's actually happening the

1042
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,640
details are often

1043
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,399
incorrect sometimes mildly so other

1044
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,360
times wildly

1045
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,320
so and it's in my experience i've seen

1046
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,918
this

1047
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,000
my own experience back when i was about

1048
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,120
ultra the people who are commenting and

1049
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,200
providing as a

1050
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,719
being a source for information for these

1051
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,039
um reports

1052
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,279
don't always have an inside knowledge

1053
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,480
about what's going on

1054
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,240
um so this seems to be somewhat of a

1055
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,000
problem not just that the reports are

1056
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,679
inaccurate and then you have to

1057
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,440
address and correct those reports but

1058
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,560
there's also an unwillingness by some of

1059
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,599
us perhaps

1060
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,320
to talk to the press so what advice

1061
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,879
would you have

1062
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,399
both for technical people should we talk

1063
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,719
to the press how should we talk to the

1064
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,799
press

1065
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,719
who should talk to the press what should

1066
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,560
we say and and if there's any advice you

1067
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,560
have for the press what would that be

1068
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,079
okay i'll go first i guess okay go ahead

1069
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,560
awesome um

1070
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,919
yeah so this is something that i've had

1071
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,799
to deal with a lot actually

1072
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,679
because um in the capacity of my job my

1073
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,639
media

1074
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,480
interaction is part of my job so that

1075
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,919
could be either on background where my

1076
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,000
name and company is not mentioned at

1077
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,520
all or where i'm actually quoted and my

1078
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,079
name and company is mentioned

1079
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,440
so uh for tech people just keep in mind

1080
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,720
that there are multiple ways that you

1081
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,920
can interact with the press and it

1082
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,279
doesn't always mean

1083
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,280
that you have to be named and outed

1084
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,280
that said you need to have trusted

1085
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,599
contacts because not all journalists are

1086
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,720
going to treat you very well as a source

1087
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,000
so uh keep that in mind as well but one

1088
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,078
of the things that really irks me

1089
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,760
when these high-profile ddos attacks

1090
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,920
happen is that there are all these

1091
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,280
charlatans that will get on the

1092
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,359
tv pretty much immediately and say their

1093
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,880
opinion about what they think it is

1094
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,560
these people are not involved in the

1095
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
investigation they're not part of the

1096
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,759
victim company they're not part of any

1097
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,439
company monitoring it

1098
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,359
and they don't have any credible

1099
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,599
knowledge about the event

1100
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,920
but still they are the first people and

1101
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,400
the most willing people to go on tv and

1102
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,280
spew

1103
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,000
something to fill content out and it

1104
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,839
seems like

1105
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,680
one of the societal problems we have is

1106
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,200
that these news media

1107
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,799
just need to fill out content they don't

1108
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,078
really care what kind of slop goes into

1109
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,200
the pig trough

1110
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,040
so i mean that's part of the problem and

1111
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,118
i mean when you are hours into an

1112
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,200
investigation you don't know who did it

1113
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,839
you don't know if it was russia or china

1114
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,720
or

1115
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,680
the basement hacker you know you just

1116
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,879
don't know

1117
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,879
and even when you find out you're not

1118
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,920
going to broadcast it to the media or at

1119
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,960
least you shouldn't

1120
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
you should be working with law

1121
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,800
enforcement working with the victim uh

1122
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,720
doing what you can to mitigate the harm

1123
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,760
and prevent any ongoing campaign that

1124
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,598
might be happening

1125
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,119
so i mean you got to be responsible with

1126
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,520
that right um

1127
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,040
but keeping that in mind i think it is

1128
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,359
important for

1129
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,520
people in our industry to do what we can

1130
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,520
to make sure that the media is accurate

1131
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,280
and even if it's saying like we can't

1132
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,920
disclose it now we can't say anything

1133
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,599
right now

1134
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,119
or even saying it's impossible to know

1135
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,520
right now that's

1136
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,720
sometimes better than saying nothing

1137
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,280
because

1138
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,040
i mean this is the only way that you

1139
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,000
could prevent the charlatans from

1140
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,520
spreading disinformation my worst

1141
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,079
nightmare is if some kind of attack

1142
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,680
happens

1143
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,760
and the charlatans go out and say

1144
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,759
nonsense and then

1145
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,839
actual people in the government take

1146
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,359
action based on that nonsense that's my

1147
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,000
worst nightmare

1148
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,839
so yeah i was hoping maybe we'd find a

1149
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,520
topic that you'd have an opinion on

1150
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:12,880
so if you found it i i i

1151
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,400
yeah um i mean i i i fully agree with

1152
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,760
allison saying that you know

1153
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,599
especially early on in the attack you

1154
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,119
can't go out and and make any meaningful

1155
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,599
statements about what's going on because

1156
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,200
hearing

1157
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,040
everything's on fire and then you need

1158
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,319
to figure out how to deal with

1159
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,440
whatever's going on

1160
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,079
uh however i do feel that um

1161
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,240
i i would hope that in in the future

1162
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,160
more people would be

1163
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,160
more knowledgeable people will be more

1164
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,879
vocal about what happens because i think

1165
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,359
that there

1166
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,560
are too many big attacks that not get

1167
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,680
talked about

1168
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,560
and if it gets put

1169
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,279
into silence then then there is then you

1170
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,520
know

1171
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,880
at some point policymakers will say well

1172
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,079
clearly it's not a big problem anymore

1173
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,760
we should never hear about it in the

1174
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,079
news anymore there's nobody saying that

1175
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
we're

1176
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,440
being attacked every week or every month

1177
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,480
or whatever and it's causing us

1178
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,400
all sorts of problems um if if we all

1179
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,280
keep it inside and we all say well you

1180
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,839
know

1181
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,640
we'll deal with it and and you just keep

1182
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,040
quiet

1183
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,400
uh that's not gonna make it go away and

1184
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,320
and um

1185
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,760
as as we said earlier in the call you

1186
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,400
know there's technical ways to dealing

1187
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,880
with

1188
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,560
uh with the tax but there's also uh we

1189
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
need to arrest the people who do it we

1190
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,040
need to

1191
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,320
make sure that the networks involved

1192
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,320
start caring

1193
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,240
more about it and there's this whole

1194
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,119
spread of different things that need to

1195
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,118
need to be done and and if nobody is

1196
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,160
aware that this is a problem then

1197
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,760
it probably won't get done right

1198
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,200
these are very good comments i just want

1199
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,920
to add a little bit to that as well

1200
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,560
is that there are some journalists who

1201
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,880
are

1202
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,480
very focused on reporting the story and

1203
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,160
they want to get things right

1204
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
when you run across a journalist like

1205
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,720
that need to invest time

1206
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,760
with that journalist spend time provide

1207
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,319
context

1208
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,079
provide background because the number

1209
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,720
one thing that we need to help

1210
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,839
combat ddos attacks and to maximize

1211
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
availability

1212
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,040
is education because education leads to

1213
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,078
empowerment

1214
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,560
and the press can be a fantastic way

1215
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,520
to educate people and thereby empower

1216
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,078
them but

1217
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,040
we who have skills and experience and

1218
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,599
knowledge

1219
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,480
do need to make sure that we invest some

1220
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,800
time

1221
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,880
with the press to help them understand

1222
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,920
what's going on so they can report

1223
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,599
more accurately and responsibly and i've

1224
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,160
spent a lot of time

1225
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,680
with the press on background as alison

1226
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,640
you know was talking about just to

1227
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,359
explain

1228
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,480
you know the the underlying mechanics so

1229
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,680
that they can get

1230
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,680
um get the story right and

1231
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,000
don't view the press as free advertising

1232
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,480
don't

1233
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,119
view it as something that you know for

1234
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,240
personal

1235
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,400
aggrandizement but instead view it as an

1236
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,319
opportunity to educate the journalists

1237
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,000
and through the journalists to educate

1238
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,680
lots of other people as well

1239
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,520
so that they hopefully will be better

1240
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,359
prepared to withstand us acts against

1241
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,520
their organizations

1242
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,480
yeah one other thing this is a civic

1243
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,640
duty

1244
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,640
like in order to have a free press we

1245
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,879
need to have a well-educated press

1246
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,720
that says things that are accurate and

1247
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,720
knows what bs looks like

1248
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,640
and if people in our industry are not

1249
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,839
educating journalists with conversations

1250
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,078
on background

1251
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,960
uh then they're just going to go all

1252
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,319
over the place

1253
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,240
so think of this as your civic duty

1254
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,560
i'll add one more civic duty always go

1255
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,839
to law enforcement and file a complaint

1256
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,680
to get get them

1257
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,200
something so that they can kick off an

1258
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,440
investigation

1259
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,480
yeah i want to steer this in a slightly

1260
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,160
different direction because

1261
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,000
you know so far we're talking about

1262
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,520
those who are not involved in the attack

1263
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,440
uh talking to the press about

1264
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,119
attacks on other companies where maybe

1265
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,240
we don't have the full information

1266
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,760
i think we also need the victims to post

1267
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,000
publicly the information that they do

1268
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,200
have and and try to be accurate about

1269
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,079
it you know don't um don't just say it

1270
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,160
was a big attack

1271
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,760
but try to give a metric on that try to

1272
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,160
explain what they've seen

1273
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,760
what they what they know about it um and

1274
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,960
what they'll find is that a lot of us

1275
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,640
can't help them

1276
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,000
but we often don't know how to help them

1277
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,560
because we don't know what was targeted

1278
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,640
we don't know

1279
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,560
the style of the attack i would also

1280
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,078
caution them against making

1281
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,078
claims for things that they don't

1282
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,040
actually know um so it

1283
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,720
as an example in the 2012 robot attacks

1284
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,319
some of the banks were claiming that

1285
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,839
they received a sinful

1286
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,079
that's actually impossible the botnet

1287
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,839
was not capable of sending a sin flood

1288
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,680
but they misdiagnosed the attack and

1289
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,319
that had people chasing the wrong

1290
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,319
avenues for a while

1291
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,400
it's been a fascinating discussion i'll

1292
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,640
maybe add one thing i think i'll

1293
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,720
read to make this statement all all the

1294
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,480
contact information for all these

1295
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,560
um folks were on that slide that you'll

1296
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,800
have uh for reference later i don't

1297
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,319
think any of them would mind if you

1298
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,760
um ask them a question about any of this

1299
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,640
stuff and i'm sure they're happy to take

1300
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,079
five minutes

1301
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,440
to respond to you they won't give you

1302
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,079
free consulting necessarily but i'm sure

1303
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,480
they'll be

1304
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,280
happy to respond to a couple quick

1305
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,960
questions

1306
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,160
so look i think we need to kind of wrap

1307
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,800
it up let me wrap it up this way um in

1308
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,118
closing

1309
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,560
i'll give you an opportunity to address

1310
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,160
something that i didn't ask or hasn't

1311
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,359
come up maybe something controversial

1312
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,118
maybe something

1313
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,359
uh potentially um meddlesome that

1314
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,800
that we haven't uh discussed yet or it's

1315
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,279
uh something

1316
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,480
that isn't a popular idea i'd be

1317
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,200
particularly interested to hear those if

1318
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,560
you have them

1319
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,598
um if not maybe just some parting

1320
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,200
thoughts so i'm gonna go in reverse

1321
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,880
order this time so if i could i'll start

1322
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,439
with you allison

1323
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,319
all right um i don't know controversial

1324
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,560
let's see

1325
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,400
all right uh there's a lot of interest

1326
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,480
in going after bulletproof hosters

1327
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,760
and it might be in a network's best

1328
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,200
interest to make sure they don't look

1329
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,640
like a bulletproof hoster

1330
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,040
so please don't do business with

1331
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:48,480
criminals thank you

1332
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,200
damian i guess i'm next um yeah it's

1333
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,680
it's a i have lots of controversial

1334
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,439
ideas

1335
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,078
but i um i would say you know

1336
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,440
make sure that you are prepared that

1337
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,680
often means

1338
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,640
uh recognizing that you need a dos

1339
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,399
mitigation provider

1340
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,480
be careful to vet your dos mitigation

1341
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,640
provider if they claim 100 uptime

1342
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,839
infinite capacity that's a lie it's not

1343
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,839
true so

1344
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,240
you know think about who you're working

1345
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,319
with but also keep in mind that

1346
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,520
having an outage is a totally acceptable

1347
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,440
solution as well

1348
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,520
often these attacks are financially

1349
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,119
motivated and if you're spending more

1350
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,640
on a dos mitigation provider than you

1351
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,480
would then would cost you

1352
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,839
for having a short outage then maybe you

1353
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,839
should just accept that short average

1354
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,720
rolling yeah i guess um

1355
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,160
the controversial thing that i'll talk

1356
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,560
about is uh

1357
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,319
i work for a vendor in the ddos space

1358
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,359
vendors are coin operated

1359
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,520
that being said if an organization

1360
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,480
has a limited budget and they have a

1361
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,599
choice between

1362
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,640
buying security related equipment

1363
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,359
and software or hiring people they

1364
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,520
should always hire the people

1365
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,400
because good people can get you good

1366
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,000
solutions

1367
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,079
i've seen so many cases in which

1368
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,160
organizations have invested a lot

1369
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,440
in hardware and software because they

1370
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,480
don't have the people

1371
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,240
with the skills and the ability to go

1372
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,040
and deploy it and make use of it they

1373
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,000
aren't able

1374
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,960
to get any value out of it and so invest

1375
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,440
in people

1376
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,160
another point i want to get across is

1377
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,760
that

1378
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,279
whether we're talking about detection

1379
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,800
classification and trades backwards

1380
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,800
we're talking about mitigation

1381
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,839
there are a lot of open source tools

1382
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,440
that are out there

1383
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,279
and you can leverage capabilities that

1384
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,880
are built into your routers your layer 3

1385
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,440
switches and that sort of thing

1386
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,319
and it's very important to acquire the

1387
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,079
skill set

1388
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,839
to be able to take some of these open

1389
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,079
source tools and play with them

1390
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,599
deploy them on your network get

1391
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,760
visibility into your network get the

1392
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,880
ability to react to attacks and mitigate

1393
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,119
them on your network

1394
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,800
it may be the open source tools are all

1395
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,160
that you need and so that's great

1396
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,240
if it turns out that you may need a

1397
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,799
commercial solution you'll have gained

1398
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,359
the experience and expertise necessary

1399
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,040
to evaluate those commercial solutions

1400
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,040
and make the right choice for your for

1401
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,560
your network

1402
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,720
thanks on behalf of the people thanks

1403
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,000
for your endorsement and carol

1404
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,078
um yeah i've uh sort of taken out of

1405
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,079
what roland said um that that

1406
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,000
an attack may not always be aimed at

1407
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,520
your bandwidth or your services or your

1408
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,960
infrastructure it may um

1409
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,800
also be aimed at your people and

1410
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,920
especially in a small organization like

1411
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,480
you know what we are

1412
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,680
if an attack lasts a long time uh it may

1413
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,440
be quite

1414
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,799
wearing out on the people having to deal

1415
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,960
with it and and

1416
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,800
uh you know if you have to stay up many

1417
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,319
many nights in a row and

1418
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,920
after a couple weeks that's that's going

1419
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,200
to get hard one on folks and

1420
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,359
maybe you know mistakes get made and and

1421
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,118
bad decisions get made so again

1422
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,960
preparation can solve that and

1423
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:48,079
yeah if you realize that that people are

1424
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,079
you can beat us people too

1425
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,000
thanks very much carol and thanks to to

1426
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,680
you all of us i hope

1427
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,280
uh was worthwhile follow you i know it

1428
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,000
was worthwhile for me i think we really

1429
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,800
covered some

1430
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,319
some good stuff here um the audience uh

1431
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,520
should realize that this is pre-recorded

1432
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,040
so we're gonna

1433
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,480
end it here and hopefully we'll have

1434
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,160
some time depending on how long we want

1435
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,760
to do some live q a

1436
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,118
we'll be able to see you again shortly

1437
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,560
so if we we're wearing different shirts

1438
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,000
that's why this will be recorded so

1439
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,710
hopefully we'll see you soon

1440
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,019
thanks everybody

1441
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:19,019
[Music]

1442
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,800
great talk we'll now have a live q a and

1443
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,960
our

1444
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,720
first question is from jordan satando

1445
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,319
is there a channel to report small

1446
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,720
volume ddos attacks

1447
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,560
uh for example persistent attack to home

1448
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,319
raspberry pi web servers

1449
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,400
um which may not be more than anything

1450
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:42,880
else but for example 200 number attacks

1451
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:45,520
per week

1452
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,520
we start with

1453
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,160
i think we have our answer

1454
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,040
well your upstream provider would be the

1455
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,280
first place i think to start if you

1456
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,279
could

1457
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,720
um next question from uh ernest meyer

1458
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,760
um thanks for the little session for

1459
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,439
your experience

1460
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,240
what do you recommend is a good ids an

1461
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,240
ips tool

1462
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,119
yeah i'll take that one so the problem

1463
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,480
especially with ips's is that those are

1464
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,240
very stable devices

1465
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,079
and state exhaustion is pretty much the

1466
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,558
same i call it the silent killer

1467
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,079
of the internet um there's a thought

1468
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,920
that oh we can always reach for the

1469
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,440
default network security tool which is

1470
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,760
the stateful firewall

1471
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,200
or the stateful ips and we'll shove that

1472
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,359
in front of our online

1473
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,799
servers and services and applications

1474
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,000
and all will meet well

1475
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,720
that's not the case in point of fact you

1476
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,920
typically

1477
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,959
end up making anything behind a stateful

1478
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,440
device

1479
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,040
more vulnerable to ddos attack and it

1480
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,240
would be the device we're not there

1481
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,400
so ips really doesn't have a role

1482
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,078
you can use an ids on a tap if you don't

1483
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,599
have any other form

1484
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,520
of network visibility and you know

1485
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,720
some of them have the capability to

1486
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,800
detect and classify

1487
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,319
some types of ddos attacks what you're

1488
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,880
not going to get

1489
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,839
is traced back to the actual ingress

1490
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,920
routers

1491
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,240
and the ingress interfaces on those

1492
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,079
routers where the traffic is

1493
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,919
is coming into your network for that you

1494
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,480
really need flow telemetry exported from

1495
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,520
the

1496
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,520
the routers themselves

1497
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,720
next question um blake willis do you

1498
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,640
have a vague idea of the percentage of

1499
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,839
ddos attacks that are actually reported

1500
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,839
to law enforcement agents

1501
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,920
does anyone else want to take that yeah

1502
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,558
i'll just jump in and say

1503
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,440
i expect it's extremely small like

1504
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,680
minuscule

1505
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,240
um part of part of the challenge here is

1506
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,839
what even classifies as a dos attack i

1507
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,240
you know one of my standard rants is

1508
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,759
that it doesn't make sense to count

1509
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,839
how many dos attacks there are you know

1510
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,640
going back to the earlier question about

1511
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,640
an attack on a raspberry pi like it's so

1512
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,839
small that it's not clear if that was

1513
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,680
a single user using you know attacking

1514
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,279
it or if that was legitimate usage from

1515
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,160
a large number of users

1516
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,200
and so yeah without even being able to

1517
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,640
count how many there are it doesn't

1518
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,240
really make sense to ask what percentage

1519
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,520
are reported but i think it's pretty

1520
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,839
small

1521
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,720
yeah i'll quickly quickly add something

1522
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,680
to that uh

1523
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,799
having filed a whole bunch of reports

1524
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,960
with the police myself

1525
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,920
uh for for a number of details attacks

1526
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,119
one of the issues often is that you need

1527
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,200
to prove that there has

1528
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,480
something bad has been done and that

1529
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,960
that you will need to get

1530
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,599
people who are not always technically

1531
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,319
very

1532
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,400
uh skilled in this particular area to to

1533
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:45,440
care about the fact that you had

1534
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,880
some sort of loss in you know maybe a

1535
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,520
monetary loss maybe some other kind of

1536
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,359
loss

1537
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,119
and and that you know this is a real

1538
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,040
problem and and

1539
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,160
the process can be so tedious that a lot

1540
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,558
of people say you know i'm

1541
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,319
just not gonna deal with it period and

1542
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,920
that is a problem

1543
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,680
one of the things that roland mentioned

1544
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,240
was a lot of these are

1545
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,879
game-based uh attacks and they last very

1546
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,319
briefly

1547
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,319
and so they're probably over and done

1548
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,040
with before you even know it was an

1549
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,759
attack

1550
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,359
and then there's the the trouble if you

1551
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,400
report an attack it's not actually an

1552
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,160
attack that

1553
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,760
i don't know how much that happens but i

1554
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,640
i know that that happens occasionally as

1555
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,400
well

1556
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,400
no one wants to be that person

1557
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,920
i mean there's honey pots that record

1558
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,800
100 percent confirmed attacks

1559
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,720
with high fidelity and those honeypots

1560
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,079
are just constantly streaming

1561
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,200
attacks like many hundreds a day

1562
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,720
and there's no way that any significant

1563
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,240
percentage of those turned into police

1564
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,399
reports

1565
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,720
yeah it's like it's middle school is you

1566
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,760
know 0.000 how many zeros you

1567
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,640
you want to add percent and typically um

1568
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,119
the ones that do tend to get attention

1569
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,400
are those that are high profile

1570
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,400
high impact and that typically involve

1571
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,960
some kind of measurable monetary loss

1572
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,359
that meets a threshold that

1573
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,440
the responsible law enforcement agencies

1574
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,759
in a given jurisdiction

1575
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,880
actually have for for taking cases and

1576
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,079
so this is why

1577
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,839
it's really important if your

1578
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,400
organization is impacted by a ddos

1579
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,160
attack

1580
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,160
you need to save all your telemetry all

1581
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,000
your data your logs what have you

1582
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,240
if you have inside counsel consult with

1583
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,920
them if not engage outside counsel

1584
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,598
understand which law enforcement

1585
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,040
agencies um

1586
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,880
have jurisdiction over this sort of

1587
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,720
thing where you are and

1588
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,240
what their thresholds for reporting are

1589
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,240
make sure that you can add up

1590
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,359
and justify you know how much it cost

1591
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,399
you and then go

1592
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:41,680
and and and make your case

1593
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,280
if you're doing this sorry

1594
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,279
if i could believe it one more moment

1595
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,359
the from the

1596
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,119
law enforcement perspective they often

1597
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,880
know about a lot of these attacks too as

1598
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,480
as alison suggested they even have

1599
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,880
access to some of that data

1600
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,480
but imagine if you're a law enforcement

1601
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,920
what do you do about all those you just

1602
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,800
simply do not have the resources to

1603
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,200
actually

1604
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,640
do anything with that amount of traffic

1605
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,319
so you also have to

1606
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:09,040
limit what you actually uh will go after

1607
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,680
sorry jason good um next question from

1608
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,359
uh

1609
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,200
john derpino can you elaborate on the

1610
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,839
process for engaging law enforcement

1611
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,839
after an attack

1612
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,839
yeah i think we kind of talked talked

1613
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,520
about that just now go ahead and listen

1614
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,078
sorry yeah a little bit run to get yet

1615
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,280
but yeah

1616
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,880
fair enough yeah so um you as an

1617
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,359
organization wherever you're based out

1618
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,000
of

1619
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,279
um you should at least have some kind of

1620
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,040
relationship with law enforcement

1621
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,680
already existing

1622
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,440
just so that you know who to call um

1623
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,000
when you make that phone call about an

1624
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,599
adidas attack happening against you it

1625
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,680
should not be the first call you've ever

1626
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,599
made to law enforcement

1627
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,200
the problem here is that technical

1628
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,240
skills are required in order to

1629
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,520
investigate

1630
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,279
technical cyber crime like in order to

1631
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,119
figure out who did the ddos attack and

1632
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,960
prove it in court and things like that

1633
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,720
it requires technical skills and not

1634
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,680
every member of law enforcement has

1635
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,879
those skills

1636
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,520
so if you are working at a company and

1637
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,359
you're

1638
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,680
highly likely at some point over the

1639
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,720
years to need to report a cyber crime to

1640
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,640
law enforcement

1641
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,078
um you should try to locate the

1642
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,000
individuals

1643
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,640
and the units that would specialize in

1644
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,800
that form of crime

1645
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,240
so um yeah the relationships are

1646
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,520
important at the local level

1647
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,439
um in whatever country you're in um and

1648
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,800
and just familiarize yourself with the

1649
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,119
reporting mechanisms

1650
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:32,079
uh that are in your country like in the

1651
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:35,280
united states we have ic3.gov

1652
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:38,000
that's kind of like a general uh

1653
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,000
pile of cybercrime reporting that's

1654
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,640
accumulated over the years

1655
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,160
but there's other places to report as

1656
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,200
well like if you have

1657
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,000
um like different kinds of cyber crime

1658
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,000
have their own

1659
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,079
like agencies almost like for child

1660
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
abuse material there's nick mc

1661
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,680
um things like that so

1662
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,040
you should familiarize yourself with

1663
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,078
that

1664
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,040
sure next question um

1665
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,319
matt p tech any ideas on how ddos

1666
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,160
mitigation

1667
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:10,160
request cleansing businesses can survive

1668
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,399
in a world which bgp path validation

1669
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,520
becomes a reality uh preventing upstream

1670
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,520
data and redirection

1671
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,040
when we get to that point i think we'll

1672
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,640
let you know

1673
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,558
yeah then number one that's a good

1674
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,879
problem they have and number two

1675
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,240
i mean we already we have a process uh

1676
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,240
that that works today

1677
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,919
you know with with uh getting letters of

1678
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,118
authorization and registering you know

1679
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,520
appearing db

1680
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,440
and so forth and you know have having

1681
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,079
you know proxy objects and things like

1682
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,240
that

1683
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,079
um are is going to be a necessity for

1684
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,640
that to be able to take place within the

1685
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:45,520
rpki context it is something

1686
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,558
um that is uh important and that has to

1687
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,839
be done it's also important to

1688
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,319
understand that

1689
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,920
uh from from a ddos mitigation

1690
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,359
perspective you have two types of

1691
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,359
providers you have those

1692
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,880
that are you know large transit networks

1693
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,960
that actually provide mitigation

1694
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,119
upstream mitigation for their customers

1695
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,200
and then you have the overlays right

1696
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,280
um and so i think it's the overlay

1697
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,078
providers uh that would potentially be

1698
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,920
the most uh

1699
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,520
impacted by that but you know a solution

1700
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,400
is needed and i believe that

1701
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,119
that one will be found and implemented

1702
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,079
sure

1703
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:20,160
last question um javier gutierrez um any

1704
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:22,240
example of open source tools

1705
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,680
do you mean you want to go first or are

1706
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,640
we talking about open source tools for

1707
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,078
attacking or for defense

1708
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,759
i think for detection classification

1709
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:33,040
trees back in mitigation

1710
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:36,079
yeah so um yeah in terms of

1711
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,279
uh detecting stuff um you know i i

1712
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,400
primarily focus on

1713
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,920
flow data um so you know whatever tool

1714
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,000
you want to use to analyze your flow

1715
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,680
that's going to be giving you the

1716
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,280
the best insight into the type of

1717
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,960
traffic coming in and it's at the edge

1718
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,799
of your network where you have

1719
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,000
you know sort of the best management of

1720
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,880
that um

1721
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,599
so that that's where i would lean um but

1722
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,079
i don't have any specific tool to name

1723
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,240
sure yes dump enough fun toolkit is

1724
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,440
popular one for open source

1725
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,359
yeah and that one's been around for a

1726
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,960
long time pm account uh

1727
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:11,359
is really good as well in tah and pro

1728
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,799
there are a number of open source tools

1729
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,799
and

1730
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,359
you can you can find those leverage them

1731
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,520
from a dns standpoint if your dns

1732
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,839
server is recursive and authoritative if

1733
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,480
they support dns tap for example

1734
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,480
which is actually a way to to be able to

1735
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,920
log dns queries and responses without

1736
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,079
blocking the servers down

1737
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,280
with syslog you can get there's open

1738
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,400
source tools that will

1739
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,599
um read and analyze that as well you can

1740
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,880
get more information

1741
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:41,119
on that at dnstat dot info

1742
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,040
the flow telemetry is absolutely a

1743
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,079
fantastic macro analytical tool

1744
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,160
scales you also need the microanalytical

1745
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,000
as well and so you know having the

1746
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,960
ability to run

1747
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,920
whether it's something like tcp dom or t

1748
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,240
shark

1749
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,040
or what have you at certain places in

1750
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,078
the network

1751
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,079
moloch m-o-l-o-c-h is also a great

1752
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,920
distributed uh packet capture and

1753
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,000
analysis engine as well so

1754
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,480
have the macro analytical with flow

1755
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,799
telemetry have the micro analytical

1756
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,160
with a packet capture capability and

1757
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,880
then also have a

1758
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,558
scalable microanalytical tool which

1759
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,440
provides some surprising behavioral

1760
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,440
detail

1761
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,119
with monitoring dns as well especially

1762
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,720
your recursive dns

1763
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,240
before we go if i could just add your

1764
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,000
best tools not software but

1765
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,279
knowing people having a good contact

1766
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,319
list outside of your upstream isp

1767
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:41,440
great point john again great talk thank

1768
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:41,440
you all
