00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,160
good morning

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,920
hi i am jezebel gilmore i am the chief

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,879
commercial officer

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,759
and the co-founder of pocket fabric i'm

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,880
also

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,600
a member a proud member of nanog

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,960
and i've been for many years today i

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,560
wanted to talk about

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,000
growing up with nanog and the gift

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,960
that is the nanak community and what it

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
had helped

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,040
me with my life and how i've benefited

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,079
from being a part of this community so

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,480
a legend a personal icon

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,960
hero to me justice ruth bader ginsburg

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,160
has once said that if you want to be a

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,640
true professional

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,559
you will do something outside yourself

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
so from my perspective

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
i have always wanted to be a better

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
person

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
i don't know about you if we were in a

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,959
physical audience

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
i'd ask how many of you want to be a

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,199
better person

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
from my perspective the meaning

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,680
and just like justice ruth bader

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,040
ginsburg had said

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,320
of life is not

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,520
for oneself but for one's community and

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,520
something that i want to say is that

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,520
we all want to be a better version

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
of ourselves because that is human

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,640
nature

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
and something as we start right our

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,880
discussion

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,399
want to remind every one of you that

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,759
so many of us are working so hard

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,920
to be a better version of ourselves

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,960
that we forget we're already beautiful

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,000
and just by putting in the work in

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,919
trying to satisfy our desire

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,200
in being better

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,479
is a huge step forward

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,520
and i want to say

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,640
that something i learned in yoga

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,480
which i'm really not that great at but

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,599
just showing up at the top of the mat

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,640
is more than half the battle

51
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,280
we can often find satisfaction

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,799
in the way we help each other to achieve

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,720
our goals

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,680
and that is really more than half the

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,480
battle

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,480
in becoming a better version of yourself

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,400
so in exploring for

58
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,440
this talk i was trying to figure out

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,800
you know what makes nanog

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,000
great so i was thinking that

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,560
nanak's a community what is

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
a community so i looked up the

63
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,159
definition

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
and apparently it's a really old word

65
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,280
it's

66
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,159
highlights commonness everybody

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,440
and from wikipedia part of this

68
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,799
community

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,959
it says that a feeling of fellowship

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,720
with others as a result

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,720
of sharing something in common

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:31,120
so what do we have in common

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:34,400
at nanog love for bacon

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,680
sushi the latest gadgets

75
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,720
faster routers or bigger ports

76
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,080
i know some of you may be laughing

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,519
but really when i dig dump

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,959
deep i realize that it's the love for

79
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,000
the internet

80
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,000
so what is the internet

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
i'm not going to read you what i've put

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,959
on this slide

83
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,399
but the internet

84
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:06,560
is a system that relies on the kindness

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,680
and trust of everyone

86
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,400
especially here the internet

87
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,319
didn't have a business plan it did not

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,358
have a ceo

89
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,880
it's not expecting returns

90
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:24,159
from anyone and something that

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,520
i truly want to highlight here

92
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,360
is that in

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,198
a comment that professor jonathan zitron

94
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240
of harvard told bbc about nanog which is

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,199
something that

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,280
i think is the most fitting description

97
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,639
of nanook that i've found

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,679
is that we are a team of volunteers

99
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,040
unpaid unauthorized

100
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,240
and largely unknown to most people

101
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,520
would wrote into action

102
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,160
and it's like the bat signal that goes

103
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:06,320
up and the batman answers

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,880
a random act of kindness of

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,840
unsung heroes that quietly keeps the net

106
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,479
working together this is something he

107
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,919
said

108
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,880
after the 2008 pakistan and youtube

109
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,880
incident i think

110
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,440
many of you still remember the people

111
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,240
come together from a feeling of

112
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,520
fellowship with others

113
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,280
that they may or may not be able to

114
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,479
physically

115
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,119
touch or meet in person

116
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,880
that yet to share a common attitude

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,880
interest and goal

118
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,800
to gain the sense of community is what

119
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:53,520
internet really is our ability to help

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,000
the world connect and form communities

121
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
i think it's kind of ironic that the

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,680
internet itself

123
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,719
is a community to help form communities

124
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,840
around the world

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,039
and it's held together by

126
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,919
a powerful community of misfits

127
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,000
and that's ourselves when i say that i

128
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,599
have this image in my head i know that

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,919
we don't all look like that

130
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:21,440
but i think of us as the unsung heroes

131
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,560
the the people behind

132
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,840
the scenes keeping the internet running

133
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,560
in making communities possible

134
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,359
now i've talked about a little bit about

135
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,120
what i think

136
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:39,840
nanak is i also want to talk about

137
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:43,520
what is my first impression of nanog

138
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,919
and how i got started we can only

139
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,400
look forward when we know our history

140
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,719
when

141
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:57,280
i started with nanag i was a young

142
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,400
operator my first time at anag i thought

143
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,198
oh my god

144
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
these people like to argue and they're

145
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,080
not afraid

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,840
to tell it like the way it is

147
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,680
sometimes it's really really rough

148
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,479
to hear but

149
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
they are the people who are in the

150
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,719
trenches

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
we are the people who are in the

152
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,240
trenches we're not

153
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,280
just doing something that's hypothetical

154
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,039
you know it's not written it's

155
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,840
doing it's making it happen right now

156
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,360
the people are real they are they may be

157
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,198
a little rough on the edges

158
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,880
and they may they may tell you things

159
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,160
that's tough to hear

160
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,680
but there are real people

161
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,840
that's affecting changes around the

162
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
world

163
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
something that i learned as part of the

164
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,120
community

165
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,638
being conscientious always trying to do

166
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,000
the right thing

167
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,840
even when it is hard and i think

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,879
that's a great reflection of

169
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,400
them saying things that i wish that

170
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,080
i was smart enough were quick enough

171
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,679
i don't know about you but how often do

172
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,800
you wish that you had come back

173
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,400
come up with a response

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
while you were in the discussion that

175
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,799
were clever

176
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:26,319
or even really courageous enough to say

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,759
there were many times that i'm sitting

178
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,039
in the great hall in the main session of

179
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,360
nanog

180
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,000
wishing that i could say what's on my

181
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,039
mind

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
at the speaker

183
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,480
to stand up and ask the question

184
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,920
as i get older i'd say that i wish i had

185
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,680
done that more

186
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,040
i'd implore you to go and do that

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
as well the courageous of others inside

188
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,439
the nanak

189
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,240
community has shown me it's okay

190
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
to go ask questions even when you're

191
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,240
unsure

192
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,239
what other people may think

193
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,599
and most importantly that i found from

194
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
our community

195
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
is that people are willing to help each

196
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,719
other

197
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,839
and they helped so many people have

198
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,240
helped me

199
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,600
without expectations of return

200
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:32,640
they may laugh and say

201
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,640
all right buy me a drink or

202
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,680
anything but really in reality there

203
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,359
were no

204
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,599
expectations of

205
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
return for the help they've given me

206
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,160
overall everybody in our community

207
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,040
care about more than just themselves

208
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,439
they care about this great thing that we

209
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,160
call

210
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,279
the internet and our community

211
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:11,040
and so i would say

212
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:14,240
that what can you do

213
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,240
be the community

214
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,800
follow the discussion there's lots of

215
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,880
discussions going on

216
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,680
around the community about the

217
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,160
technology the policy the politics

218
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,719
the people so much

219
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,600
be a part of the discussion don't be

220
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,680
afraid

221
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,880
to participate don't be afraid to ask

222
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,880
questions sometimes

223
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,120
it takes that one piece to fall into

224
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,680
place for you to truly understand

225
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,720
what everybody else is talking about

226
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,959
because you missed it

227
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
or you just didn't know it happened to

228
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,359
me a lot

229
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,800
and don't be afraid

230
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,440
and be open-minded because not everybody

231
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,920
is going to agree with you and or you

232
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,560
agree with everyone else

233
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,839
be open-minded and agree to disagree

234
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,199
share your ideas because sometimes your

235
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,399
ideas is great

236
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,680
sometimes maybe it isn't but

237
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,279
without sharing it you will not

238
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,439
know it that requires you to step

239
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
out of your comfort zone and i have to

240
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,959
say that is a hard one

241
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,839
it is so much easier said than done

242
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,800
and even as i sit here to talk to you

243
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,320
about

244
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,319
being a part of the community

245
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,880
i'm trying to show you and lead

246
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,599
by example in stepping out of my comfort

247
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,839
zone

248
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,079
because i hate public speaking and i

249
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,880
really am not very good at it

250
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,239
you know sometimes you have that buzz in

251
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,639
your head

252
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,399
when you're starting to feel nervous i

253
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,160
might have that right now

254
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,480
and um but push yourself

255
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,439
push your boundaries step out of your

256
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,880
comfort zone

257
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,639
that's how we all grow

258
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,079
and volunteer help others

259
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,560
be a part of the community

260
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,000
help others to learn the value of the

261
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,719
community

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,720
and so we can all evolve for the better

263
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:31,519
and sometimes you got to ask yourself

264
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:34,639
what can i do that someone else can't

265
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,839
and often that answer is

266
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,040
not really that much of anything but

267
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,760
however

268
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,120
if you always have the expectation well

269
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,800
somebody else can do it better

270
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,440
so somebody else will do it for us

271
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,639
then you end up with taco bell being the

272
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,440
best mexican

273
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:59,600
restaurant in the united states so

274
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,320
do something and express

275
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,320
your own

276
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:10,720
authentic self

277
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,279
so i'm going to come and talk about

278
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
myself and how i grew up in this

279
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,000
community

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,680
a little bit to help you understand

281
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,079
how it helped me and how it had helped

282
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
me

283
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,239
accept myself

284
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,600
so i was just

285
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,120
a small young operator in the community

286
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,000
and i always thought oh people who are

287
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,480
successful

288
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,120
who are big who are experts in areas

289
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,279
are the ones that should be contributing

290
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,560
what have i got

291
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,639
not much right and

292
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,160
so i i've been participating in the

293
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,399
community listening

294
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,920
quietly i always thought that others

295
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:02,320
have better things to say than i did

296
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,560
because i didn't quite accept me for who

297
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,720
i

298
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:11,199
am for my capabilities my voice

299
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,519
carried weight as well

300
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,199
just because that other people have

301
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,240
something to good to say

302
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:22,079
doesn't mean that i don't and

303
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,279
the more that you

304
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,239
stand up for yourself the more

305
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,320
confidence

306
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,000
you will gain i started as

307
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,199
a volunteer in the community when nanog

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,440
became neonog and

309
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,319
we had some financial challenges as a

310
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,519
community

311
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,519
and i love the community so much and

312
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,760
i had so many friends in the community

313
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,320
or that i've built over the years

314
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,600
i wanted the community to continue so i

315
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,199
thought well

316
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,839
um maybe i can help

317
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
do an outreach program be a part of the

318
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,680
sponsorship

319
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,040
community a committee and

320
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,279
help the nanak to raise funds

321
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,240
and sell sponsorship to become

322
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,279
sustainable

323
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,800
and self-sustaining that's when i first

324
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,399
started as part of the community

325
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:22,079
the committees in volunteering

326
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:25,440
what i learned being a part

327
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,040
of the sponsorship committee is it's so

328
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,720
much harder

329
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:35,920
than it is then so much harder

330
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,920
um done than said because

331
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,440
i was not very good at asking other

332
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,639
people for money

333
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,959
i really never felt that was a thing

334
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,079
but i felt so strongly about the

335
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,439
community

336
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,439
and nanak that

337
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,759
i was willing to step out of my comfort

338
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,360
zone to help it

339
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,880
to help make sure that we were

340
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,079
self-sustaining

341
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,920
i went to large companies that are

342
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,839
potential sponsors

343
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,319
and spoke to them about the value of

344
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,160
being a part of the community and part

345
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,880
of the sponsorship

346
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,360
what i was able to do is to speak from

347
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,240
heart

348
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,040
because i felt it and i knew what had

349
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,120
done for me

350
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,800
and i wanted to express that

351
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,639
to others but moreover

352
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,199
as i was raising funds for nanog

353
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,959
i realized that i was able to

354
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,240
communicate

355
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,479
in this fashion

356
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
better than i thought i could and the

357
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,440
more i did it

358
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,120
the better i got and

359
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,759
not only i was able to raise funds

360
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,800
but i was able to listen to what others

361
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,079
have to say

362
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,199
in return and how they wanted to see

363
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:01,120
the sponsorship evolve and what

364
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:05,678
value it would it could bring for them

365
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:09,119
so i worked with the staff of nanag

366
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,839
and the board to help shape

367
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:16,000
the new sponsorship programs back then

368
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,000
we have much better ones even now today

369
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,959
to build better sponsorship

370
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:26,400
programs for

371
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,240
the sponsors of our community

372
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
they are also a part of the community

373
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,360
they make it possible

374
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,720
and guess what i learned from that i

375
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,439
learned that

376
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
maybe i can do more than just being an

377
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,760
operator

378
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,280
i can explain the value of

379
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,320
what i'm trying to do and what my fellow

380
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,520
engineers

381
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,918
are trying to do i can become a conduit

382
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,918
between the engineering and

383
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,918
the buyers the business side of

384
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:05,360
nanog and our community and thus

385
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,960
it helped and led me into being

386
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,159
becoming or stepping into the next stage

387
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,280
in my life from an operator becoming

388
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,640
someone in the business development side

389
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,678
of my personal career

390
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,280
and just to be honest i thought long and

391
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,400
hard about being in business development

392
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,200
because that sometimes that's considered

393
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,679
sales and

394
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,679
it is and i always thought to that

395
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,679
as a position that people looked down up

396
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,799
to engineers

397
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:45,360
don't sell but

398
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,360
nanak helped me realize that

399
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,799
i was good at it i

400
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,840
had to accept through the process of

401
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,160
growing up with nanog

402
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,720
that i am good

403
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,760
at business development i can do more

404
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,400
than just being an engineer

405
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,799
and being on the operation side of the

406
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,799
business

407
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,960
and all of that contributes to the

408
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,640
belief

409
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,640
of something bigger than just ourselves

410
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:27,440
and along the way not only that

411
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:30,559
i was helped by so many others

412
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,360
i realized that by

413
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,720
helping others that it had created to

414
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,760
greater return

415
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:42,080
for me and

416
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,960
from volunteering on the committees

417
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,720
i went on to become a board member of

418
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,840
nanog

419
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,080
two consecutive terms

420
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,600
and that helped me gain incredible

421
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,360
perspective

422
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:01,678
to see the bigger picture to understand

423
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:05,760
what others need

424
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:09,600
and hear what

425
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,720
they are looking for from this community

426
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,840
and stand up for something that

427
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,280
i cared about greatly whether that is

428
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,879
nanak as a community or

429
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:28,080
is a fellowship program for

430
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:31,919
abba huja a great personal friend

431
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,199
who had passed away that helping

432
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,159
women in networking

433
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,280
by providing some resources from the

434
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:45,039
great nanak community

435
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,240
so i

436
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,520
would say that

437
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,640
although that i gave some of my time

438
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,080
and effort to nanong i got

439
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,080
a lot more in return

440
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,039
because it had pushed me

441
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,480
to advance to the next stages of my

442
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,158
career

443
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,000
and something that i also want to talk

444
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,360
about is

445
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,960
learning to push my boundaries

446
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,639
while others pushed me because people

447
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,640
uh friends within the community

448
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,280
every day help me to understand

449
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,159
that i can be better sometimes it's

450
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,000
really hard

451
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:36,880
to learn that lesson that

452
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,720
community tells you like how it is

453
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,720
it's hard and

454
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:49,760
so i would encourage you

455
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:53,600
to do all of that by participating

456
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,640
and volunteering with nanak

457
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,918
here's some things that you can find

458
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,280
the nanak website working together

459
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:06,320
for a better internet of tomorrow

460
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,678
a community built on openness

461
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,799
authenticity and collaboration

462
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,080
with eye on equality and

463
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,120
here in the netherlake community

464
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,918
we learn to be accepting and we are

465
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,199
accepted

466
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,080
by each other and in a community

467
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,600
that we have this great community that

468
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,199
we have

469
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,199
we learned that life is about others

470
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,320
and we need others to better

471
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,559
understand ourselves and they help us

472
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,480
to become better versions of ourselves

473
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:50,240
so lastly i leave you with something

474
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,400
that i recently read i'm not religious

475
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,440
i'm not trying to push any religion on

476
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,919
anyone

477
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,080
but what i want to highlight here

478
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,600
is that we're all born to help each

479
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,720
other

480
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,600
no matter how difficult it is life is

481
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,440
good when you're happy

482
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,639
and much better when others are happy

483
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,250
because

484
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,480
of you and how do we

485
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:20,559
[Music]

486
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,520
find happiness compassion

487
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,120
is really what i think is the most

488
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,280
important

489
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,639
and compassion is relationship between

490
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,840
equals

491
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,440
and at nanog we find each other doesn't

492
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,678
matter what we do

493
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,480
to be equals and

494
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,360
we find our own darkness and we get to

495
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,400
know it

496
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,879
we help each other explore that those

497
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
challenges and in becoming better

498
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,840
versions

499
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,320
of ourselves and then we can be there

500
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,639
for each other

501
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,639
please

502
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:07,520
i ask you at the end of today

503
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:12,000
to do something for someone else

504
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,000
so they can be happy because of you

505
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,960
and thank you thanks to the nanak

506
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,400
community

507
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,720
for giving me the opportunity to share

508
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:33,840
my experience with nanak

509
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:33,840
and my joy from this community

510
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,039
thank you so much zezebel for recounting

511
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,840
your experiences

512
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,158
i think uh it resonates with a lot of us

513
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,879
and

514
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,760
uh as for me i think the big takeaway is

515
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,679
that

516
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,440
even though we are very technical uh

517
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,440
being the engineers and geeks that we

518
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
are in our professional lives

519
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,120
having that business acumen to be able

520
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,240
to translate that

521
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,600
idea or the you know the talent that we

522
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,039
have into the next big thing

523
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,879
i think that's equally vitally important

524
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,799
um let's see if you have any questions

525
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
coming in uh from the audience

526
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,279
uh yeah please feel free to type in

527
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,000
anything that you would like to ask her

528
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,159
but for me uh if you've seen those

529
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,919
changes coming across over the years

530
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,600
where which direction do you think we

531
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,440
are headed in terms of bringing in new

532
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,678
people infusing

533
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,640
you know invigorating the uh the core

534
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,720
membership base

535
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,159
of our audience well over the years i've

536
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,960
seen a lot of changes

537
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,279
uh at nanag there were a time when i

538
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,559
thought

539
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,840
350 attendees at a nanak was an

540
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,320
enormous conference and i think

541
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,120
in february this year when we had our

542
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,439
last in

543
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,879
person conference we had well over a

544
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,000
thousand and ten days

545
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,919
so um the community is growing

546
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,240
and it's it's maturing in addition to

547
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,120
you know being the unsung heroes behind

548
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,919
the internet

549
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,959
uh there are so many other businesses

550
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,240
that's

551
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,360
heavily dependent on what the networking

552
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,480
industry provides

553
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,360
as a foundational service and so as part

554
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,880
of that

555
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,000
i think that we're going to be seeing um

556
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,720
new talent coming in maybe freshly out

557
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,400
of college

558
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,679
uh maybe just joining the workforce

559
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,559
and moreover transitioning from other

560
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,279
uh areas of the industry of

561
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:33,520
technological industry

562
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,600
um we're transitioning out into other

563
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,240
parts of the supporting industry

564
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,879
um into supporting networking like i

565
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,679
have

566
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,159
um personally from being an operator

567
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,080
into leading the business side of

568
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,600
um networking just because it's

569
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,480
business it's you know business

570
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,320
development sales um

571
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,000
or anything in support it doesn't mean

572
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,840
it's actually any worse

573
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,080
um it's not a lower position or

574
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:07,279
you know that's not as honorable

575
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,000
so um i'm proud of what i do

576
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,799
and what i do for the industry and i

577
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,679
think the

578
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,600
the maturing of the industry is going to

579
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,279
continue to expand

580
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,039
our community and we need to be

581
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,480
open-minded and accept

582
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,960
everyone that wants to be a part of this

583
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,960
community

584
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,480
thank you so much and we couldn't we

585
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,039
could have been happier to have you

586
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,080
do our keynote presentation so on behalf

587
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:43,120
