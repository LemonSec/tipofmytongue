questions portion

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,360
because we have a large candidate pool

pare down

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,959
everyone will have approximately one and

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
a half minutes

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,640
to answer the questions so i hope you're

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,640
a rake awake and ready to go

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
if we are going too much over that time

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,760
i will

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,680
need to mute you to move on to the next

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,079
candidate just to ensure that everybody

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,720
has

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
the same amount of time to share an

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,080
answer

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,520
so thank you very much and the first

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,240
ques we are going to be going

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200
in alphabetical order um as the

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
candidates

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,080
with the candidates last name or surname

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,159
and we're going to start with vincent

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,798
first and then i will give a prompt for

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,280
tom d tomkay sean tina and bradley

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,439
in that order so the first question for

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,119
all of you will be

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,119
how this came from the community the

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
first two questions came from the nano

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,720
membership community

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,479
um so just let you know that's who these

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,439
first two questions came from

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,640
the first one is how would you encourage

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,520
more experienced nano members to mentor

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,119
or volunteer to engage and retain the

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,560
next generation of nano

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,159
members vincent go ahead

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,079
so how would i uh essentially

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,040
help encourage uh the more we'll call it

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
tenured members of the nano community to

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
get more people

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,399
engaged the younger people i would say

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,760
it's really just about reaching out

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,080
and i think formalizing the

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,679
uh mentorship program uh would

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
definitely help because everyone kind of

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
likes to have that

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
we'll call it sense or a tool or an app

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,359
so that they can follow but

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,519
really i i don't think we need to have

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,160
all those tools it's just the sense of

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,640
really wanting to go and make that extra

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,120
effort

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,839
and and giving back i mean even myself

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,080
i've

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
had other people that have walked uh ran

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
into and they asked well how do i do

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,160
this how do i do that

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
and knowing that someone's actively

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,120
reaching out to you and you're seeing

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,839
them

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,360
wanting to give back i think that itself

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,319
is an indication that this is going to

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
be someone

79
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,560
that's going to give back in return and

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,959
have that um be able to keep that

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
mentorship relationship going

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,200
and that in return is just kind of

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
paying it forward

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,040
thank you and as um i just said i didn't

85
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,319
let you do your opening and we had an

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,319
opening and closing so i'm going to give

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,599
you guys closing so that that's actually

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,958
probably better for you

89
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,119
um so sorry about that so next would be

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,599
tom d

91
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
if if you need me to read read the

92
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,159
question i'm happy to do so

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,440
no thank you kendra i appreciate it um

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,840
ways that i would consider uh engaging

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,599
uh less experienced members of the nano

96
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,080
community so i think vincent had a great

97
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,720
answer

98
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,599
in the mentorship program i would also

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,239
consider

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,159
uh trying to place a lot more emphasis

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,760
on our tutorials programs

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,720
uh when i got engaged with nanog back in

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,840
2006

104
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
we had almost a half a day or more of

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,159
tutorials

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,319
before every man before every nanog

107
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,560
meeting uh formally kicked off

108
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,920
and i think that there's a huge amount

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,519
of benefit

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,119
in hearing stories about a day in the

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,799
life of a network engineer a day in the

112
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,239
life of a network programmer

113
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,080
or a day in the life of a techno

114
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,040
technical business developer across our

115
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,640
industry

116
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,280
and so i would encourage us to bring

117
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,720
back our tutorials programs

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,200
um another aspect to consider is

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,040
a little bit of a twist on mentorship

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,679
but what about one-on-one coaching where

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,079
we connect

122
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,478
nano community members with each other

123
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,079
in more of a professional coaching role

124
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,840
and it's not just about membership it's

125
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,800
about checking in and seeing how folks

126
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
are doing

127
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,160
in development of their professional

128
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
goals and objectives

129
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,199
that might be outside of your employer

130
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,638
might be across

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
organizations in ways that allow people

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,880
to express

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,320
themselves in ways they might not be

134
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,680
able to in a coaching relationship

135
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
within the working environment

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,680
i think those are two opportunities that

137
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,240
the nano community has in front of them

138
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,560
thanks kendra oh thank you tom tom k

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
sure so i have um three three kind of

140
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,520
major points um

141
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,800
one as everyone else mentioned the

142
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,639
ministry program

143
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
um you know second one will be creating

144
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
a regional uh blueprint

145
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,120
for nogs to kind of create and third one

146
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,719
would be uh job boards and

147
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,400
basically um what my goal would be is to

148
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
create a structured mentorship program

149
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,280
and this is where you would have mentor

150
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,479
matching training goal setting and

151
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,080
evaluation

152
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,320
um and this would kind of strengthen the

153
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,599
networking operations community

154
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,440
um it would be something where there

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,160
would be a website or something go on

156
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
and be able to match the mentors and and

157
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,960
do that

158
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
um the uh second point would be a

159
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,638
regional non-blueprint program

160
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,000
um you know i'm of the opinion that uh

161
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,919
one way to grow our communities to

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,639
enable other smaller knocks as a feeder

163
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,758
program

164
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,680
to nanoc and this program would help

165
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,639
organizers create their local logs at a

166
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,639
smaller scale

167
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,680
similar to what i've done here in

168
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,199
chicago

169
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
and the third point would be job boards

170
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,600
i think

171
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,280
you know having a nano job board where

172
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
similar to other organizations such as

173
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,679
acm or ieee

174
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
when they have very specific websites

175
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,840
where you can kind of

176
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,479
put in your resume and be able to help

177
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,719
find

178
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,479
jobs i think that would kind of increase

179
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,000
and help us grow

180
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,199
in our future great thank you so much

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,199
um sean thank you kendra i

182
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,039
i'd go away from the technology and

183
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,520
focus on being available

184
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,159
to newcomers to our community and that

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,758
just doesn't

186
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
doesn't mean just going to newcomers

187
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,280
lunch or participating in the hackathon

188
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,440
which are

189
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,119
great forms to reach out to people but

190
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,319
back in your own communities in your own

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
organization

192
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,440
are there people that could be attending

193
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,359
nanog that should be

194
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,639
are there means to get them there can

195
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
you make it

196
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,680
a point for their boss with your own

197
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,560
community some of them do have strong

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
regional logs like nine og chinog which

199
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,440
both vince

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
and tom have participated in other areas

201
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,199
it's more meetups

202
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
so go to meetup be available to people

203
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
talk about nanog

204
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,960
mention it there's we talked about

205
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
veteran members of community

206
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,758
there are a number that are have the

207
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,680
privilege of being able to go to other

208
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,759
nogs in other regions

209
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,280
and so on and that's another case where

210
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,560
you can do outreach

211
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
uh on behalf of nanhog lastly as a board

212
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,479
member

213
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,719
if you're elected you do get the

214
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,680
privilege of representing nanog

215
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
at formal events so some of our outreach

216
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,080
meetings and so on and

217
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,080
just spend that extra time to talk to

218
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,560
people in the audience

219
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,400
let them know about nanak let them know

220
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,440
what you get out of nanog

221
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,840
and what's important to you and

222
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,960
find out what's important to them and

223
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,080
hopefully you'll get people to

224
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,599
participate

225
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,280
communicate come back and uh

226
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,159
like kendra volunteer like all of us

227
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,000
volunteer for the organization

228
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,520
excellent you guys are doing a wonderful

229
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,639
job with your timing i'm not even having

230
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,680
to mute anyone

231
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,479
uh tina you are next would you like me

232
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,960
to read again or

233
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,960
are you good

234
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,799
sorry i forgot i was muted um no i'm

235
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,680
good uh

236
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,360
it's difficult to go fifth um brad will

237
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,479
have a harder time but

238
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,080
uh so many great ideas here and i agree

239
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,520
with all the formal ones the mentorship

240
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
program the board's been talking about

241
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,560
that that's actually a work in progress

242
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,318
um

243
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,240
there's so many ways we can bring people

244
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,800
together and we try to do that through

245
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,000
newcomers and women in tech and all

246
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,400
these things

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680
um but as a as a woman attending these

248
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,960
conferences

249
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,160
for more years i'd like to admit

250
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,640
um i'm used to being the minority that

251
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
that person that doesn't see people like

252
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,760
them in the room

253
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,760
and because of my experience with that

254
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,760
now i go i know tons of people

255
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,159
it's it's hugs and hellos everywhere i

256
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,519
go but i try to look for that person

257
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,040
that looks lost and try to find them

258
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,680
and introduce them to who they need to

259
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,439
meet try to always meet the fellows

260
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,959
and find make sure they're getting what

261
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,320
they need out of the meeting

262
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,079
um i think also bringing people from

263
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,959
your environment to the meeting and

264
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,000
making um nano available to people in a

265
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,040
hybrid

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,080
functionality as we return to normalcy

267
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,279
hopefully

268
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,959
um soon will be critical um

269
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
because we've learned so much from this

270
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,479
virtual environment

271
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
and how we can bring people in from

272
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
other communities that aren't

273
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,399
participating today

274
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,079
as much as we want and we can kind of

275
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,839
fill that gap of the young

276
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,080
um new in their career and the um

277
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,839
the regions that have less support from

278
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,399
local dogs and whatnot

279
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,080
uh there's so much we can do but it's

280
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,240
just reaching out to people that you

281
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,600
don't know in the hallways making sure

282
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,440
that they're having the valuable

283
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
connections they need to have because

284
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,399
frankly anybody can attend and watch it

285
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,839
video you know remotely why do they want

286
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,360
to come to a conference why do they want

287
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,640
to participate why do they want to be a

288
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,160
member and vote

289
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,720
they need to have that connection with

290
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,719
the community that we have and as

291
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,720
people as the engineering community we

292
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
have today ages out we have to

293
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,880
make sure there's backfill and that

294
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,760
knowledge and the tutorials

295
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,240
it's an all-encompassing thing thank you

296
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
tina

297
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
and don't worry each one of you will get

298
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
to be first

299
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,800
and each one of you will get to be last

300
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
so brad

301
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,839
go ahead let me know if you need me to

302
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,959
repeat anything

303
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,320
yeah why don't you go ahead and repeat

304
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,518
the question just because it's at the

305
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,839
end of it and

306
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,640
people may have joined late yep not a

307
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,959
problem

308
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
um the question is that came from

309
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,160
someone in the community was how would

310
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,560
you engage

311
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,040
more experienced nano members to mentor

312
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,439
or volunteer to engage and retain

313
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,000
the next generation of nano members

314
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,040
so this is a kind of a different take on

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,839
it so everyone

316
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,399
before me all brought up great great

317
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,640
points

318
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,959
is that we need a mentorship program to

319
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,439
get new people built up in their skill

320
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,839
sets

321
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,959
the question is though it's not

322
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,040
necessarily about

323
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,079
once they're at the conference what we

324
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
can do to build them

325
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,279
it's getting them to the actual

326
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,680
conference uh

327
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,200
my very first i was able to attend

328
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,800
because somebody else in my company

329
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,560
wasn't going on that trip

330
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,160
and that opened a spot in the budget for

331
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,079
me to go many

332
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,600
organizations limit their budget to x

333
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,439
number of people attending so many

334
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
conferences in so many places

335
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,959
because they do have to manage that

336
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,240
budget so what can we do to lower that

337
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,399
barrier of entry

338
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,279
for the newcomers to get them to attend

339
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
how do we make it

340
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,240
easier to bring in new fresh faces

341
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,920
and then keep them as a part of the

342
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,600
community uh

343
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,079
the nano program committee puts on a

344
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,399
great track every single

345
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,160
meeting after the meeting is over you

346
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,399
can watch the videos on youtube

347
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
so why is a company going to send

348
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,440
somebody to a meeting

349
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
to watch a take that they can do with

350
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
their desk in the office

351
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,800
it's changing that perspective and

352
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
opening up eyes that it's not just the

353
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,760
technical talk

354
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,719
it's the interaction between people

355
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,439
within the industry you're opening doors

356
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,320
for your future not just with the

357
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,240
company you're at

358
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,360
but your future for your career and i

359
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,120
think that's something where we need to

360
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
shift the focus on not just setting up

361
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
training

362
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,240
but shifting the focus of how do we make

363
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,040
it more accessible

364
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
thank you so much brad and i commend you

365
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,959
for being last on the first

366
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,920
question so the next question we're

367
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,040
going to

368
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,240
start with tom d so

369
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,680
this was also submitted by part of the

370
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,519
membership community given the

371
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,599
anticipated limits

372
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
around travel for possibly the next

373
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,760
couple of years

374
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
how would you guide nanog to retain and

375
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,880
expand

376
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,880
community engagement and professional

377
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,000
development

378
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:46,160
tom d yes

379
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,399
okay sorry thanks kendra no problem

380
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,199
so first and foremost i want to commend

381
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,120
the current

382
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
administration and the program committee

383
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
on their efforts to date i mean i think

384
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,240
we're doing

385
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,360
a wonderful job of getting the community

386
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,519
together

387
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,240
uh in a virtual environment so that way

388
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,800
we can continue the tradition of nanog

389
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,440
um you know i think one thing that we've

390
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,560
seen

391
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
with the pandemic is there is no

392
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,638
one-size-fits-all solution

393
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,560
and the solutions that apply are highly

394
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,120
regional in nature

395
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,719
so it may be the case and i'm i'm

396
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,000
thinking a couple steps out here may be

397
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,560
the case that

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,320
the full-blown nano meeting needs to

399
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,599
remain in a virtual environment for a

400
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,200
period of time

401
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,839
but it is possible that on a regional

402
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,360
basis

403
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,279
we might be able to bring back the

404
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,240
nanohog on the road program

405
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,680
for certain areas sooner rather than

406
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,959
later

407
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,638
and maybe that's not just applied to

408
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
you know the us we are the north

409
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,680
american network operators group

410
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,839
and so we need to think about other

411
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
regions like canada and mexico

412
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,519
so how can we bring uh

413
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,920
nanog beyond sort of the traditional

414
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,440
venues that we have as a way to

415
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,920
adapt to the pandemic

416
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
in addition to that we've seen a number

417
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,599
of

418
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,399
pop-up events uh that are occurring in

419
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,440
our community

420
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,639
um some of them happen over facebook

421
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,480
some of them are happening in irc

422
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,320
most of them happen in a you know a

423
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,760
video chat based format

424
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,240
like zoom uh so how might

425
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,360
the nano board work with the community

426
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,360
to formalize those types of engagements

427
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,800
and get them on some sort of schedule

428
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,560
that's recurring and something that we

429
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,040
as community members

430
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,239
uh can rely on uh and you know many of

431
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,360
these in

432
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,760
many of these programs are happening um

433
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
in the evening east coast hours so how

434
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,880
might we

435
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,199
work together as a group to adapt to

436
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,480
time zones that work for everyone across

437
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,519
uh north america thank you so much

438
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,600
tom uh tom k

439
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
can would you like that to answer that

440
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,040
or do you need to read that again

441
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
no i think i got it okay thank you for

442
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,199
that question um

443
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560
so i think the way we can kind of um

444
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,920
expand the community engagement

445
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,359
professional development

446
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,920
um with the given um travel restrictions

447
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,040
i mean

448
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,639
i think the virtual nano is a is a

449
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,319
it is really great i mean it's opening

450
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,240
up the doors to so many different

451
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,000
people um just a newcomers meeting we

452
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,320
had people from all over the world

453
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,079
which is not something that um you could

454
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
do because of the travel

455
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,920
um so maintaining that virtual

456
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,800
environment is great but

457
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,399
um i also think that um you know if tom

458
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
talked a little bit about nanaka on the

459
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,720
road

460
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,199
um i think not only the road was a great

461
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,560
idea but it it missed one thing

462
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,000
it came to this town did the conference

463
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,000
and then left

464
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,680
what i propose is that we actually work

465
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,800
within all those communities to create

466
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,160
their own dogs

467
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,880
local nogs and what this would do

468
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,639
is you would basically have people that

469
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,600
live in the same town that don't have to

470
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,480
travel

471
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,480
um whether they start with small meetups

472
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,560
move to bigger conferences

473
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
or just sit there and watch the virtual

474
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,599
nanox

475
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,199
as they as they occur but that that

476
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
would bring that

477
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,240
the people together there and i think

478
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
that

479
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,920
where nanak can come in and help is

480
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,839
basically write a

481
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,399
blueprint just similar to what nano has

482
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,920
done helping a lot of ixps kind of build

483
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,079
within different regions

484
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,360
we can do the same thing with helping

485
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,359
dogs organized

486
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,279
and taking take them through to the

487
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,320
various stages of development

488
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,920
from small meetups to even bigger

489
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,759
conferences and i think this will

490
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,199
really engage the the community as a

491
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
whole in our community

492
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,560
and then also help um with the

493
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,199
professional development at a small

494
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,199
level

495
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
that eventually as the travel

496
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,040
restrictions um

497
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,399
uh are done um could bring everyone

498
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,959
together at one big

499
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:53,360
nano conference thank you tom um sean

500
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,239
yes so i was very active in the nanak on

501
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,279
the road program

502
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,759
uh and helped lead it from the start and

503
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,519
uh

504
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,800
among other things we did go to two

505
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,480
cities in canada

506
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,039
uh we went to waterloo we went to

507
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,480
toronto and we went to other places in

508
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,559
the united states where we couldn't hold

509
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,959
an anarch meeting

510
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,240
but i think there was a bit of a

511
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,240
divergence from

512
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,160
some of the needs of those communities

513
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,520
nanak on the road was this full one day

514
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,880
program

515
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,319
we try to use our same social networks

516
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,679
to get attendees and not everybody can

517
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,319
spend a full day

518
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,480
away from their job for a meeting and i

519
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,960
think some of the local nogs

520
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,080
have had more success with a shorter

521
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,280
program

522
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,559
so what i'd propose is a couple things

523
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,520
uh nanak is working on additional uh

524
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,360
programs and for collaboration online

525
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,160
and i think that could be a natural

526
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,559
place

527
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,080
to help other regions organize whether

528
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,799
it's

529
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,799
forming baby nogs or having channels or

530
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,120
for communication

531
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,240
and so as those products are developed

532
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,439
one of the things that i was planning to

533
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,799
do is reach out to some of the

534
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,280
established noggs

535
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,320
and folks that lead meetups and see is

536
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,918
this something

537
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,520
that that's interesting to them is this

538
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,360
something that would help them

539
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
uh organize and it may or may not

540
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,159
because not everybody wants another app

541
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,440
on their phone or another method of

542
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000
communication

543
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,360
but the online format that we've done

544
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,600
for the past two meetings

545
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,959
has been very valuable in reaching new

546
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,879
attendees

547
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,720
secondly i think nano could provide

548
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,520
shorter online meetings

549
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,120
on an intermittent basis and and do that

550
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,160
across our service area

551
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,039
and lastly um

552
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,480
work with uh the local meetings and and

553
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,000
provide speakers as they

554
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,520
they need and we've done that uh

555
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,440
particularly with nynogg uh

556
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,440
i we've offered it to chinook i don't

557
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,280
think it's normally synced up

558
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,679
but there definitely are opportunities

559
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,039
but i'd say scale it back

560
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,080
and do something simple uh and try to

561
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,879
reach new people

562
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
and revise that to improve it as we go

563
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,120
along

564
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,120
excellent tina

565
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,639
can you repeat the question just to make

566
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,679
sure i don't go off too off track

567
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,160
yeah fair enough it's it's a bit long um

568
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,160
given the anticipated limits around

569
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,880
travel for the next possible couple

570
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,600
years

571
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,880
how would you guide nanog to retain and

572
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,959
expand

573
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,440
community engagement and professional

574
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,559
development

575
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,600
so i agree with some of the ideas about

576
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,399
you know

577
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,039
doing local participation but i've been

578
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
really

579
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,240
um pleased to see the turnout that we've

580
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,559
had

581
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,480
as we've increased our virtual presence

582
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,840
and having nanak 79

583
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,400
as a no-cost event for attendees um

584
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,159
i i experienced um interaction with

585
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,799
people that were never able to attend

586
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
before

587
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,400
and they told me the only reason they

588
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,480
could go was because

589
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
there was no travel and no costs but

590
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,360
their employer would let them have the

591
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,320
hours off they needed to attend the

592
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,520
meeting

593
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,840
um there was such a great adoption

594
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,120
for that i really see that as our avenue

595
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,480
to explore

596
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,360
to get that mid-range attendee um

597
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
i think i touched on this before um but

598
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,080
we have this gap

599
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,919
uh you know newcomers to the industry

600
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,678
and remote attendees that we've been

601
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,039
trying to fill for years

602
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,760
and i feel like we finally found the

603
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,440
silver bullet for that and we can't lose

604
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,360
that when we go back to in person

605
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,640
and even if we can get an in-person

606
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,199
meeting um

607
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,400
you know where we can have four or 500

608
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
people in one place

609
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
even if it's not fully attended we can't

610
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,600
forget

611
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,360
this hybrid model we can't forget the

612
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
value we've found here

613
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,199
and we can't lose those attendees that

614
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,000
can't come and pay six hundred dollars

615
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,520
person

616
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,080
to to attend and fly and get hotel rooms

617
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,918
um so what i really think we need to

618
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,520
learn is how to make the in person feel

619
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,559
more like this

620
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,879
for those remote people have sessions

621
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,320
um that are more like zoom sessions at

622
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,039
the in-person meeting where they can

623
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,520
have

624
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,520
one-on-one minutes with the board with

625
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,280
key players in the industry have those

626
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,840
mentorships maybe facilitate

627
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,960
small group meetups that sort of thing

628
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,360
to increase the

629
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,000
virtual experience so it continues to be

630
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,520
part of our community going forward

631
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,240
thank you tina brad

632
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,240
sorry i'm mute

633
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,320
uh so i've been trying to crack notes

634
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
here while everyone's been talking and i

635
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
didn't want to be rude while

636
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,080
listening but so far everyone has

637
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,880
brought up some really great points

638
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,960
it's you know talking to the local nogs

639
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,400
and seeing if we can help out there

640
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,159
that would be great maybe they do need

641
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,440
help and we're just unaware because we

642
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,960
haven't talked to them

643
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,559
or maybe the dogs are doing fine and

644
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
they don't need our help but i think

645
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,320
following up with local nogs and

646
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,360
creating a resource where we can track

647
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,240
all the different nogs that are

648
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,240
available how to

649
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,679
attend because you may not know that you

650
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,440
have a nog in your

651
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,200
local area unless it's advertised

652
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,640
somewhere if you're not connected to

653
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,640
other people within the industry

654
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,840
in your locale how do you know if a

655
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,679
nog's going on

656
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,559
so maybe we can help there by sharing

657
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,159
out information about local nogs

658
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,600
tina brought up a really great point

659
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,280
about this hybrid model

660
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,719
i think the hybrid model going forward

661
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,280
is going to be huge

662
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,480
not only because people can attend

663
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,320
because of the cost

664
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,120
but sometimes people just don't want to

665
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,799
attend maybe they don't have

666
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,799
the desire to be around people and

667
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
they'd rather have time to work and then

668
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,039
watch

669
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880
talks while they can that gives them

670
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,240
that opportunity to do so so i think

671
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,159
going forward the hybrid off

672
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,240
model will benefit the community as a

673
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,080
whole

674
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,600
but have we talked to our members

675
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,678
have we reached out to the members to

676
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,918
say hey we're looking at possibly doing

677
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,960
a nanog on the road or maybe a local nog

678
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,400
in your community

679
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,320
do you think this would be of interest

680
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,520
to have something like this in your

681
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,280
in your city in your towns if so is it

682
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,720
something we can help you set up

683
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,158
maybe we can reach out and find people

684
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,000
who want to set up and run their own

685
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,880
dogs in the city but they don't know how

686
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,760
so how do we help them do that thank you

687
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,520

i didn't get a chance to answer the

697
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,080
second oh my goodness i skipped you

698
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,280

all right kendra i apologize called good

700
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
uh can i ask you just to repeat the

701
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,320
question

702
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,000
very fair enough um so given the

703
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,158
anticipated limits

704
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,360
around travel for the next possibly

705
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,080
couple years

706
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,879
how would you guide nanog to retain and

707
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,720
expand

708
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
community engagement as well as

709
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,000
professional development

710
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,159
so i think one thing that uh

711
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,600
i'll hit on there with the professional

712
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,360
development and this was mentioned

713
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,080
earlier on with the

714
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,799
uh first question is education you know

715
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,879
something that i

716
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,480
mentioned in the candidate questions

717
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,440
that was published was

718
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,960
uh i wanted to make nano the go-to place

719
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,559
right if i ever had a question i want

720
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
that to be the top thing that

721
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,600
shows up that you know nano here's that

722
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,360
answer

723
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,879
and i think that goes again with some of

724
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,039
the things that some of the other

725
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,080
candidates had mentioned was getting

726
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,000
back to

727
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,240
the the tracks the tutorials the

728
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,440
education which also brings in

729
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,279
uh the new members right and that in

730
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,720
itself will keep that community

731
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,960
engagement uh i love and i think uh

732
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,840
other people have seen outside nanag

733
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,000
um tom k and myself right we we do uh

734
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,799
shy nog we've talked to other dogs

735
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,440
uh such as envy and hog right and had

736
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,440
them

737
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,120
how do they ask us how did you guys

738
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,279
start this up right

739
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,760
and to be able to encourage that as well

740
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,520
as i think we also need to go

741
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,600
maybe outside of the operator's group as

742
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,520
well the enterprises also need to knock

743
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,879
i mean that's diversity in itself right

744
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,720
thought diversity that

745
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,360
will help strengthen the community as a

746
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,720
whole uh and lastly i'll i'll say

747
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,240
yes hybrid meetings that's been

748
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,440
something that as the chair of the

749
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,480
program committee that's that's been

750
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,159
keeping me up on

751
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,240
how that will look like because as

752
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,159
a lot of people have said we've had

753
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,240
people at the hackathon we've had people

754
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,880
from south africa right this enabled

755
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,880
not only participants but also speakers

756
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,760
uh the previous speaker that was uh

757
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,760
dressed up

758
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,440
he was in the late netherlands and again

759
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
without this kind of

760
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,799
virtual hybrid it wouldn't be possible

761
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,480
so we need to keep that cognizant going

762
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,440
forward

763
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,320
thank you uh all great answers so now

764
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,400
sorry i

765
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
totally didn't mean to skip you vincent

766
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,000
um tom k

767
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,320
uh what should the nano board do

768
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,360
to ensure the next generation of network

769
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,799
engineers

770
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,000
see our community as positive diverse

771
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,120
and it's a inclusive

772
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,480
good question um i think

773
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,879
um you know there's this uh there's this

774
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,000
concept or idea that you know nanak is

775
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,440
there's a lot of people have been here

776
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,159
in industry for a long time they know

777
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,039
each other

778
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,679
it's a it's kind of a hard club to get

779
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,320
into

780
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,600
um unless you you've been doing this for

781
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
a while and you've known a lot of these

782
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,240
people

783
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,360
um so um how do we

784
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,480
you know we have to break that by

785
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,639
bringing in people

786
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,559
um that are brand new to this and i

787
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,360
think you know one of the ways you bring

788
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,879
in people to

789
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,120
to nano in this industry is have someone

790
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,799
after college or something have a job

791
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,279
within the industry you know that's one

792
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,039
of the key things and that's why

793
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,400
you know i'm i'm a big supporter of

794
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,120
having a job board or something like

795
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,159
that

796
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,559
to be able to provide people jobs within

797
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,100
the industry

798
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,639
but that um

799
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,799
[Music]

800
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,240
thank you tom so we're going to go to

801
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,600
sean next

802
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,159
do you need the question read are you

803
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,959
good no i'm happy with the question

804
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,559
so i i think we've uh nanak's put in

805
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,840
some stronger policies

806
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:13,279
and put a focus on diversity added

807
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,080
programs throughout region to to

808
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,360
bring in the operator of tomorrow but i

809
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,960
think one glaring

810
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,199
area is the nano mailing list

811
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,399
so while our meetings have become uh

812
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
more friendly

813
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,158
um i i think for people that aren't used

814
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,279
to the community

815
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,480
um the nano mailing list can be uh

816
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,919
dawning and as vince said

817
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,679
it's somewhere where you can really go

818
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,600
and get any question answered you could

819
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,520
meet somebody that has that knowledge

820
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,959
um as long as you don't get say hey

821
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,240
search the archives

822
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,760
um so i think really focusing

823
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,880
on making nanak more friendly online

824
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,200
providing more avenues making sure that

825
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,559
we

826
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,120
do the hybrid meeting correctly

827
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,720
and bring in sponsorship for those

828
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,520
online activities are really where the

829
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
board

830
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,000
can focus a lot of energy to further the

831
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,799
work that's already been done to make it

832
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,919
uh more friendly to newcomers to make it

833
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,799
more diverse

834
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,840
and on top of the policies that do not

835
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,000
permit

836
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,360
uh activities that that used to happen

837
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,600
in anarch

838
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,479
so i think there's some work done uh

839
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,799
particularly

840
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,200
making uh nano the best resource online

841
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,080
uh is the best area to focus on as far

842
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,039
as that

843
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:36,080
question thank you very much sean tina

844
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,960
so um i was afforded the opportunity

845
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,639
to explore bylaws and policies in depth

846
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,120
shortly after joining the board because

847
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,559
of some incidents that came to light

848
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,360
um but on the positive side of all that

849
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,399
our community

850
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,439
really embraced the discussion um i had

851
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,559
so many impactful conversations around

852
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,520
that time

853
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,080
um and i really feel like the especially

854
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,240
the the

855
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:05,360
senior members our community really um

856
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,159
are trying to fix the problem and being

857
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,479
one of the

858
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,440
you know small percentage of women at

859
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,919
these events

860
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,960
um and that's one number we track we

861
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,159
don't track

862
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,120
um other uh categories we don't

863
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,600
uh trans for example we don't track that

864
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,760
um

865
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,199
it's it's tough we've done some things

866
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,879
to make thing make it feel more

867
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,320
inclusive we started handing out the

868
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,240
pronoun pins

869
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,678
we're trying to make sure facilities are

870
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,840
available make sure

871
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,880
everybody knows they're welcome i think

872
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,678
is the really

873
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,399
key element and the women in tech

874
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,480
luncheon

875
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,000
isn't just women it's not only about

876
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,039
women everybody's invited

877
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,919
um if you want to follow up we we make

878
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:49,360
this a really open conversation in there

879
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,799
um i think also just finding people that

880
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,320
you know uh that look it you know it

881
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,960
goes back to that find the people that

882
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,879
don't look

883
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,000
like they're surrounded and already know

884
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,159
have their center

885
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,679
group and find out what they need to get

886
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,600
out of a meeting make it valuable for

887
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,279
them make them feel included

888
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:10,719
um our social should be for networking

889
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,320
and not anything else and

890
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,080
we've done a lot to curb our um curb our

891
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,600
behavior as an organization to make it

892
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,120
feel more inclusive and i want to keep

893
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,399
it going that direction

894
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,080
thank you tina uh brad do you need me to

895
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,158
read the question

896
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,199
if you would be so kind to read it again

897
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,440
absolutely

898
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,679
what should the nano board do to ensure

899
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,720
the next generation of network engineers

900
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,120
see our community

901
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,240
as positive diverse and inclusive

902
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,918
uh so dni is a

903
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,360
very important subject that's been going

904
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,240
on diversity inclusion has been

905
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,240
discussed

906
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,279
within anag and it's i'm sure most

907
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,320
companies have been just having

908
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,840
discussion as well

909
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,720
within your own place of work uh nanog

910
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,080
needs to realize that it has a little

911
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,159
bit of an image issue

912
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,360
we have been doing great things as an

913
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,559
organization

914
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:06,240
taking the right steps to become

915
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,519
more open and inviting the issue is is

916
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,960
that while we have

917
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,320
we can set these uh id

918
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
we can set the rules in place we can set

919
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,039
the guidelines we can get everyone

920
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,080
following what we're looking for as an

921
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,919
organization that is great it

922
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,439
does not change the perspective of

923
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,279
everyone else until the community as a

924
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,039
whole starts working together to realize

925
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,679
that this doesn't work

926
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,080
if we're not going to be open inviting

927
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,679
it's

928
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,039
i'm going to say it's going to sound bad

929
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,080
but it's just going to be a room full of

930
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,240
old white guys

931
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,519
and unfortunately that model just

932
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,360
doesn't work

933
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,720
you how many people have come to a nano

934
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,080
walked in the room

935
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,320
and not seen somebody that they can

936
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,000
identify with in the room

937
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,678
they're the single person they're trying

938
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,039
to figure out how they can fit in

939
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,360
into a community that's supposed to be

940
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,840
the next generation for the network

941
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,559
of the internet so if we're trying to

942
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,760
build something

943
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,760
for the future we need to be in a place

944
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,039
that supports those people and it needs

945
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,720
to start intrinsically

946
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,960
as an organization we can set these

947
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,120
guidelines but it really comes down to

948
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
people need to walk that talk and if you

949
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,559
see people

950
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,480
not doing that say something we're

951
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,639
adults i'm sorry at this point

952
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,320
in your life if you see somebody saying

953
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
something or doing something that's not

954
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,720
right

955
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,239
say something if you don't feel

956
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,159
comfortable talking to them

957
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,399
talk to the board they're there to help

958
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,799
you they have things in place

959
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,719
to manage situations like this but until

960
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,559
we start standing up as a group

961
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,200
and calling out this stuff is going to

962
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,200
keep happening

963
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,320
thank you very much and vincent i didn't

964
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,080
forget you this time i'm so sorry would

965
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,480
you like me to read the question or

966
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,840
do you have it i i think i have it

967
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,760
things can be

968
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,120
uh you know one of the first things that

969
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,240
you mentioned there was

970
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,719
the next generation and i think

971
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,399
simply i think we need to ask them i

972
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,399
mean we're trying to make

973
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:02,158
changes based upon what they we think

974
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,879
uh they would uh essentially appeal to

975
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,200
but we're not necessarily asking right

976
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,679
and

977
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,120
i i think the common theme here is we

978
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,320
really need to make people

979
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,080
feel more welcome more included reach

980
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,279
out to that person that again

981
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,320
is just you kind of see they may be lost

982
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,279
they may be

983
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,439
well you know shouldering up and ask

984
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,640
them well how can i help how can

985
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,399
i make you feel warm and welcome here um

986
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,120
the other thing here is that you know

987
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,320
now we know networks right that that's

988
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,199
our expertise

989
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,879
and i think we may need to reach out to

990
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,480
other organizations that are actually

991
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,320
more skilled right and that's what they

992
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,720
do is diversity and inclusion

993
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,600
and ask for pointers and guidance there

994
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,919
again

995
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,600
i mean i myself that that's not my

996
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,399
specialty of expertise i've reached out

997
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,240
to other

998
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,559
friends that i knew that do this on a

999
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,679
regular basis but i think we

1000
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,480
as an organization should

1001
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,360
consider that thanks kendra that's

1002
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,640
fantastic

1003
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,479
thank you um tom d

1004
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,519
you want me to read it again for you

1005
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,599
please absolutely

1006
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,000
what should the nano board do to ensure

1007
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,359
the next generation of network engineers

1008
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,359
see our community as

1009
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,918
positive diverse and inclusive

1010
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,399
so the way i i take this as two

1011
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,440
different

1012
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,679
elements of similar and related uh

1013
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,679
questions so the first piece is on the

1014
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,280
positivity element to it

1015
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:34,560
um you know nano

1016
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,440
has had a image problem at times

1017
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,119
and i think that it comes down to

1018
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,599
telling a story

1019
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,480
um and i'm seeing nano do that we're

1020
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,359
starting to

1021
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,560
send out our member spotlight videos um

1022
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,159
one of the things that i'm particularly

1023
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,320
excited about not just because i had the

1024
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,800
privilege of doing so but we're looking

1025
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,919
into our own community for more keynote

1026
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,520
speakers

1027
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,598
um so i'm really excited to hear from

1028
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,200
jezebel and avi

1029
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,800
over the next two days to hear about

1030
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,399
their stories and their success with the

1031
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,880
nano community

1032
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,400
um so i think that's on the positivity

1033
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,359
side it comes from

1034
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,200
you know inside you in your heart uh and

1035
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,520
your own self-confidence as to

1036
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
you know the self-fulfilling prophecy of

1037
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,240
being what you say that you are and i

1038
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,919
think that's

1039
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,598
something that our community can work on

1040
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,119
together um

1041
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,720
with respect to diversity and

1042
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,200
inclusiveness and i'm sorry about the

1043
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,399
garage door going off in the background

1044
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,399
um you know i want to acknowledge that

1045
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,079
this is work that as a board we have to

1046
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,599
proactively

1047
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,160
acknowledge that this is work we need to

1048
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,839
do we need to continuously iterate we

1049
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,078
need to continuously adapt

1050
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,000
and know that this work is never done

1051
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,160
there is no sort of magic moment where

1052
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,040
the board can sit back and say

1053
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,040
excellent you know nanog is positive and

1054
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,279
nanog is diverse and nano is

1055
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,880
inclusive um that is work that we're

1056
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,640
always going to have to do and i think

1057
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,560
the way that we can get there

1058
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,078
some of the ways that we can contribute

1059
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,599
is to continue to have

1060
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,440
really really high standards for

1061
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,480
ourselves we have a great code of

1062
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,800
conduct

1063
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,240
uh for our meetings and and as other

1064
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,280
candidates have mentioned maybe that

1065
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,279
needs to be

1066
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,960
visited extended to our mailing list as

1067
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,480
well as to our virtual communities that

1068
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,000
we engage in

1069
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,240
and i think it's also important for the

1070
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,119
board to make sure that we're being

1071
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,919
transparent

1072
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,520
um in in what's going on we have to be

1073
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,119
transparent in dealing with issues in

1074
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,720
our community

1075
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,880
while respecting the privacy of our

1076
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,040
community members and that's a very very

1077
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,640
hard and fine line to walk

1078
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,480
and it's something that we as a board

1079
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,920
should be working on regularly

1080
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,800
thank you tom uh sean we're going to

1081
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,359
start with you

1082
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,400
on the fourth question very much rolls

1083
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,839
into a lot of

1084
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,640
the things that you guys just said so

1085
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,960
nanak has a well established reputation

1086
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,118
for being cliquish

1087
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,200
how do you engage and encourage

1088
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,280
newcomers to continue

1089
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,000
to attend and feel like they are part of

1090
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,760
this community

1091
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,200
so i mean one of the first things i do

1092
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,119
is is find why they're attending nanag

1093
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,720
what did you come to this meeting for

1094
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,119
who do you work for

1095
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,520
who are you interested in meeting um and

1096
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,760
so in the past i've made connections

1097
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,640
uh for people that were looking for to

1098
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,440
buy a service

1099
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,799
they were looking to arrange a peering

1100
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,480
relationship

1101
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,400
or in the case of our nci

1102
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,680
which are the college emergency students

1103
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,400
i've introduced them

1104
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,839
to potential hiring managers or at least

1105
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,960
people that could mentor them

1106
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,520
along the professional process to

1107
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,560
getting a job in network security and so

1108
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,200
on so it's making that first step of

1109
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,799
finding out what they want maybe making

1110
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,399
an introduction

1111
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,160
maybe they already have some contacts

1112
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,079
but they're looking for a friendly face

1113
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,560
so i always unfortunately

1114
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,200
with this online meeting i got the name

1115
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,279
of

1116
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,720
the newcomer in our breakout room but i

1117
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,320
don't have their face and i don't have

1118
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,560
their email address

1119
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,920
and so i can't follow up with them but

1120
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,799
at the in-person meetings

1121
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,839
i do look for my newcomers in the

1122
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,119
hallways

1123
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,680
i look for them at beer and gear look

1124
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,000
for them at the peering

1125
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,040
coordinator forum and just try to keep

1126
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,839
that follow up and

1127
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,599
and say here's a face you know what are

1128
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,880
some other faces you need to

1129
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,680
meet and take that extra time

1130
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,040
to make that first step to get to know

1131
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,839
something about them

1132
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,839
and help them out find other people like

1133
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
them

1134
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,079
admitted thank you very much sean tina

1135
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,598
would you mind rereading it these

1136
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,560
questions are quite similar i want to be

1137
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,960
sure i'm still yeah

1138
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,560
okay i would say it they were completely

1139
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,520
written separate but you guys all had

1140
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,640
the right tone

1141
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,800
so um nanog has a well-established

1142
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,598
reputation for being cliquish

1143
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,640
how would you encourage and engage

1144
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,760
newcomers

1145
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,160
to continue to attend and feel like part

1146
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,040
of this community

1147
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,640
okay so um for one thing i want to kind

1148
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,599
of clarify as we've been talking about

1149
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,279
diversity

1150
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,119
and newcomers and whatnot we've really

1151
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,240
focused on

1152
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,160
people that of all different

1153
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,200
you know genders and all the all these

1154
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,640
different things but there's also

1155
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,359
personality types

1156
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,160
there's introverts that don't know how

1157
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,000
to approach

1158
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,839
a group of people that are chatting that

1159
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,839
are incredibly uncomfortable with it

1160
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,359
even if they're one mission at this

1161
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,720
entire conference was to meet with

1162
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,400
somebody from that company

1163
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,480
they are not going to interject

1164
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,920
themselves um

1165
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,320
so i think as a culture

1166
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,359
we all need to carve out a percentage of

1167
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,280
our time

1168
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,040
to make sure that we engage with people

1169
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,160
we don't have scheduled meetings with

1170
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,599
and aren't old-time friends um

1171
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,279
and it's hard to tell when you're in the

1172
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,040
hallway and you see four people talking

1173
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,920
if they're just having a casual meet-up

1174
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,400
over coffee

1175
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,200
or if they're in a negotiation for new

1176
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,200
terms

1177
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,560
so people get intimidated about walking

1178
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,799
up and approaching

1179
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,000
so i think an improved meeting tool

1180
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,400
would be great so that

1181
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,920
people can reach out but we have to

1182
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,160
change the mentality

1183
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,160
and get people no matter how senior you

1184
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,279
are at your company or how important you

1185
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,399
think you are

1186
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,119
um everybody needs to make time

1187
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,560
in their schedule for those one-offs

1188
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,000
that's why they come to these meetings

1189
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,078
that's why you're there and um yeah i'll

1190
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,359
wrap up uh endeavor short on time

1191
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:34,160
no no you're fine thank you tina um

1192
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,160
so next we will be going to brad

1193
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,560
do you mind repeating the question for

1194
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,920
me again i apologize

1195
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,920
not at all nanak

1196
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,440
has a well-established reputation for

1197
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,480
being cliquish

1198
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,000
how would you engage and encourage

1199
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,720
newcomers to continue to attend and feel

1200
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,079
like they're part of this community and

1201
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,598
that's a hard one

1202
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,119
we've been like like tina said we've

1203
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,400
been talking about diversion diversity

1204
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,440
inclusion in the sense of bringing in

1205
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,800
differences of people but once you're

1206
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,640
there how do you actually include them

1207
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,920
into conversations that's that's a hard

1208
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,520
thing to do

1209
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,680
uh especially because some

1210
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,720
are social butterflies and they love to

1211
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,200
talk to everybody

1212
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,240
others may not be so how do you find

1213
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,720
ways to be

1214
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,680
inclusive without scaring people away

1215
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,439
because it's

1216
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,240
too much for them having meeting tools i

1217
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,480
think would be

1218
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,000
huge a tool that can actually set up

1219
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,200
where you can find the people you need

1220
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,440
to talk to

1221
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,118
or you saw somebody in the hallway or

1222
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,319
saw somebody giving a presentation and

1223
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,240
you wanted to follow up time with them

1224
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,319
but you're too scared to go talk to them

1225
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,000
create an avenue for them to reach out

1226
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,640
to follow up that way

1227
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,599
for those of us who do like talking to

1228
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,440
people

1229
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,079
take time out of your day and meet

1230
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,319
someone new set a personal goal

1231
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,200
to meet five new people at a nano

1232
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,520
meeting

1233
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,720
maybe it's their first time maybe it's

1234
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,119
their 20th time

1235
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,078
but if you haven't met them or said hi

1236
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,480
how are they going to feel

1237
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,079
welcome here if you can't take just a

1238
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,720
little bit of time to go say hi

1239
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,480
again this isn't this isn't something

1240
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,839
like

1241
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,440
sorry this isn't something that i feel

1242
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,400
the board should have to change is that

1243
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,319
my one minute

1244
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,000
no no it's just letting you know they're

1245
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,359
fine okay got it

1246
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,480
uh there's something i don't think it's

1247
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,680
something the board should change i

1248
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,640
think this is something we need as a

1249
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,160
community to change

1250
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,759
unfortunately i don't think the board

1251
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,920
can set mandates and

1252
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,920
do all these things but we need to do as

1253
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,200
a community we need to make a change and

1254
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,319
i think the only way to do that what the

1255
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,720
board can do is

1256
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,680
enable us to do that by providing tools

1257
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,000
and whatnot

1258
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,000
thank you brad vincent would you like

1259
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,359
the question we read are you good

1260
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,240
i believe i'm good thanks kendra so

1261
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,759
i i think part of this is uh back to

1262
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,640
making people feel

1263
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,760
uh welcome and comfortable and and part

1264
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,040
of that is just

1265
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,960
taking that extra step when they you

1266
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,079
meet someone new or even someone that

1267
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,520
you've seen around

1268
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,400
they ask a question uh how do i

1269
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,680
do this or who do i know right and it's

1270
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,960
just not doing a

1271
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,598
blanket line talk to this person maybe a

1272
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,240
warm hand

1273
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,200
off where now you can engage that person

1274
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,439
with the other person

1275
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,200
in the conversation right that's how we

1276
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,520
have them engaged in

1277
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,200
how we include them i think some of

1278
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,720
these things as brad mentioned you know

1279
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,359
it's probably not something from

1280
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,799
the board to mandate but enabling and

1281
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,598
maybe giving some of these skills these

1282
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,680
are things that

1283
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,280
some people just have learned because of

1284
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,319
nature of their job or they've gone to

1285
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,079
other classes

1286
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,000
but maybe just having that out there

1287
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,960
part of a professional

1288
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,119
we'll call it development how to be able

1289
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,480
to engage people in conversations how to

1290
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,000
have a conversation i think

1291
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,760
those are the tools that would enable us

1292
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,680
to again make people

1293
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,280
feel more welcome and we as the

1294
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,839
community have to make that extra

1295
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,680
step extra effort to make everyone feel

1296
00:43:52,839 --> 00:44:00,720
welcome

1297
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,720
thank you very much um tom d

1298
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,319
yeah so i think i'll start off by saying

1299
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,000
you know it

1300
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,440
it starts with the board so don't be

1301
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,680
part of the click um

1302
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,960
step out of your own relationships and

1303
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,960
encourage

1304
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,560
uh your you know the board members to

1305
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,000
get out there and meet the newcomers to

1306
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,240
meet people in our community maybe

1307
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
not even newcomers maybe people who are

1308
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,200
uh coming back to meetings so i think

1309
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,920
part of it starts with

1310
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,520
you know i mentioned on the last topic

1311
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,240
holding yourself to a certain level of

1312
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,319
standard

1313
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,598
or to a standard and for board members

1314
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,040
to hold themselves

1315
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,960
uh to not be part of that click and

1316
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,720
invite the newcomers into the community

1317
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,359
but actual things that i think we can do

1318
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,680
so um

1319
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,200
i remember when i first attended nanog

1320
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,279
back in 2006.

1321
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,720
um i went to the my first meeting in st

1322
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,760
louis and i didn't think i was going to

1323
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,879
go back

1324
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,359
um because of that clickiness that i

1325
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,880
felt

1326
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,359
and i wasn't sure if i was going to be

1327
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,960
able to break into the group or not

1328
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,799
so i wonder if there are things that we

1329
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,400
can do as a board to re

1330
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,240
and the reason it worked out was um

1331
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,839
i went to multiple meetings and i

1332
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,399
wouldn't say i felt like part of the

1333
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,799
community until i attended

1334
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,560
at least two if not three maybe four

1335
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,680
nano meetings and it was sort of on that

1336
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,319
fourth meeting where

1337
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,720
you know it clicked so i wonder if there

1338
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,040
are

1339
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,319
incentives maybe we can put in place for

1340
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,880
newcomers

1341
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,440
um to attend multiple meetings so that

1342
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,160
way they

1343
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,480
get more face time with the community

1344
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,839
and

1345
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,560
and they can feel uh connected and i

1346
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,119
think

1347
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,759
i i haven't seen this in our surveys but

1348
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,599
uh

1349
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,520
we do this with e-commerce transactions

1350
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,720
we do this with online buying we do

1351
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,800
it with um you know various uh websites

1352
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,759
it's the nps score it's the net promoter

1353
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,280
score

1354
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,079
and maybe we should be asking our

1355
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,240
community would you attend anag again

1356
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,680
and if we get a no we should be diving

1357
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,839
into that no and understanding

1358
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,359
understanding why we get a no back and i

1359
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,480
i don't think that's a survey question

1360
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,720
we asked today

1361
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,160
if it is i apologize for missing it no

1362
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,160
thanks thank you

1363
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,920
very much um that's very insightful um

1364
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,078
tom k

1365
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,160
sure thank you for the question um so i

1366
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,079
think i think that the question is

1367
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,520
um basically how do you structure how do

1368
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,119
you create a program how do you create a

1369
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,560
system where newcomers

1370
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,720
feel like they're they're part of this

1371
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,560
community versus

1372
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,640
competing with someone that's been in

1373
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,078
all been there for 10 years or so and

1374
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,759
know so many people and i'm a big

1375
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,440
proponent of that and that's why i think

1376
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,440
having a very structured mentorship

1377
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,960
program is an example of that

1378
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,200
a couple of things i do agree i feel

1379
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,040
like um i agree with tom what he said

1380
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,279
about the board don't be part of a click

1381
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,960
um it starts with the board and i

1382
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,400
believe the board has a responsibility

1383
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,880
and can help a lot

1384
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,599
um with that so some of the ideas what i

1385
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,359
think we can do

1386
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,880
um you know just like in college and

1387
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,240
other places where there's a freshman

1388
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,560
class that starts

1389
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,680
or mba programs where there's cohorts

1390
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,920
why not do that

1391
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,200
um why can't we create a system and a

1392
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,800
program to help

1393
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,720
people that are first here the first

1394
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,960
time they're here have a cohort with the

1395
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,480
same group of people that they can

1396
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:04,079
kind of keep that they can um

1397
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:07,280
be together and uh even throughout

1398
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,280
other conferences and and after that um

1399
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,280
because what i think it is it's it's

1400
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,440
basically the people that are new here

1401
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,040
uh they will create their own clicks

1402
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,800
their social networks

1403
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,240
um and that's kind of one of the things

1404
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,440
that i think they have to

1405
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:24,078
realize um but we do need that bridge to

1406
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,280
the um to the people that have been here

1407
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,000
for a long time and i believe that's

1408
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,000
where this

1409
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,040
very structured mentorship program and

1410
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,119
there's a lot of

1411
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,720
a lot of corporations have that uh set

1412
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,880
up where there's websites

1413
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,720
uh where you apply you get approved for

1414
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,960
both mentor mentoring

1415
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,359
so i think that would kind of help them

1416
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,960
feel better by having that bridge there

1417
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:48,000
but i think also those thank you tom i'm

1418
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,559
i am sorry um next question is going to

1419
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,400
go to

1420
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:54,240
start with tina um how do you see nanag

1421
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,599
reaching out to the next generation of

1422
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,919
network professionals

1423
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,400
and finding these people to bring to

1424
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,400
nanak

1425
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,839
yeah that that one's tricky um you know

1426
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,720
we we've gone down we've explored

1427
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,920
different paths

1428
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,720
um we have the college um uh

1429
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,880
program right now um we've talked to

1430
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,160
some high schools we've done all that

1431
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,000
but i i i think that you know getting

1432
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,480
people into this industry is less of a

1433
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,599
problem

1434
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,559
than getting them to our meetings um

1435
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,760
i think it's a knowledge base i've been

1436
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,160
talking to some people

1437
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,800
you know communication is just different

1438
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,799
amongst

1439
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,160
you know 20 something year olds than it

1440
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,200
is 30 40

1441
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,240
50 year olds um it's they're using

1442
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,919
different communication

1443
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,680
platforms i don't think we're

1444
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,280
advertising necessarily and putting

1445
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,240
ourselves out there in the same way that

1446
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,200
we should

1447
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,959
i think we we need to engage some people

1448
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,919
you know take advantage of our college

1449
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,040
fellows and

1450
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,400
ask them if if their um professor didn't

1451
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,240
bring them this program

1452
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,400
how would how could we have gotten a

1453
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,879
hold of them and let them know it exists

1454
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,640
um i don't think that's an answer for

1455
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,640
for me i don't think i'm the right

1456
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,640
age frankly um but we have

1457
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,558
we can ask the right people and we we

1458
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,879
need to go down that path

1459
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,839
excellent thank you so much tina brad

1460
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,599
would you like me to read that to

1461
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:21,920
yes please no problem how do you see na

1462
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,000
nano reaching our next generation of

1463
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,640
network professionals and finding these

1464
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,839
people

1465
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:31,920
to get them to come to nano

1466
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,880
uh so that's a it's an interesting

1467
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,119
question and i think

1468
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,640
tina kind of touched on it a little bit

1469
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,760
we need to figure out what the best

1470
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,799
method to do so

1471
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,240
is so coming into this with the i

1472
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,599
instead of okay we're trying to reach

1473
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,359
young people

1474
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,520
is a mailing list really that way to do

1475
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,880
it how many people subscribe to the

1476
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,319
mailing list and all actually and

1477
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,920
actually are interacting

1478
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,920
get involved with it that are new people

1479
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,240
or younger people

1480
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,280
i i'm willing to bet the demographics

1481
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,558
don't line up with that

1482
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,079
i don't have the research to show that

1483
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,160
so that's a blanketed statement so i

1484
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,520
apologize if i am completely off

1485
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,359
but i think we need to look at a way of

1486
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,040
how do we reach out i

1487
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,720
i can't tell you i'm 37 years old i

1488
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,880
don't know i

1489
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,879
couldn't tell you but like tina said we

1490
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,839
have college students attending

1491
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,520
through our plan we have nano members

1492
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,520
who are professors

1493
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,440
why not work through them why not create

1494
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,720
a college program where we can go to

1495
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,720
more colleges

1496
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,240
to get it out to the so that the

1497
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,078
teachers can tell their students

1498
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,078
hey just so you know this is available

1499
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,400
for you as you move through your

1500
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,079
schooling or your career this community

1501
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,079
is there i think we need to be more

1502
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,599
vocal but we need to find partners

1503
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,960
that can work with us to hit that

1504
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,480
targeted demographic

1505
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,880
thank you bro you didn't you don't even

1506
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,880
need the cues brad

1507
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,160
you're you're doing great vincent um

1508
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,960
would you like that question read to you

1509
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,078
again

1510
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,319
yes please absolutely how do you see

1511
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,480
nanag reaching out to our our next

1512
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,400
generation of network professionals

1513
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,559
finding these people in order to bring

1514
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,960
them to nanak

1515
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,160
i i think uh my fellow candidates here

1516
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,440
have uh

1517
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,399
i'll harp on some of the things that

1518
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,119
they had mentioned and i think it's

1519
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,280
really

1520
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,400
asking what that next generation what do

1521
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,240
they want to get out of it

1522
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,599
and again it's trying to understand from

1523
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,000
the other side

1524
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,040
what is important to them and i think

1525
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,359
it's been mentioned

1526
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,040
you know at my time it was the mailing

1527
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,839
list i wanted to find out how to do

1528
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,200
things and why not

1529
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,040
maybe it's that same piece of

1530
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,799
information but in a different medium a

1531
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,040
different vehicle

1532
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,800
and then as far as being able to talk to

1533
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,680
them again i think

1534
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,040
for me it's to make it personal for

1535
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,720
other people that i've talked to on how

1536
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,599
to get them engaged how to get involved

1537
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,640
i let them know my story of how nanag

1538
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,760
helped me

1539
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,160
and why i'm giving back and usually when

1540
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,920
it's

1541
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,799
when it's personal that's where people

1542
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:55,280
really take the heart

1543
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,280
thank you very much vincent um tom d

1544
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,800
so i think in some of the most recent uh

1545
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,839
nanogs we've had some presentations

1546
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,280
about the next generation of network

1547
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:08,078
engineer and

1548
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,280
you know nanog is historically a

1549
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:14,240
operator group a service provider group

1550
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,839
uh and we've maybe not reached well into

1551
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,680
the network engineers

1552
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:21,040
in the enterprise and that's a community

1553
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,799
or a voice in our community that might

1554
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,359
be missing so i think

1555
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,319
trying to understand how networks extend

1556
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,960
you know

1557
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:31,680
large-scale operator networks like the

1558
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,280
ones that are representing

1559
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,118
extending into the enterprise might be

1560
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,720
one place to go looking but another

1561
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,480
place as we talked about

1562
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,399
the the next generation of network

1563
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,920
operator is that

1564
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,760
um you know the world of network

1565
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,839
operations is becoming increasingly the

1566
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,480
domain of software engineers

1567
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,160
and software engineers that are

1568
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,440
interested in networking

1569
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,200
so i think we have to go look under

1570
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,920
those rocks we have to find those folks

1571
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,200
that

1572
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,599
um you know take a deep interest

1573
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,720
in solving networking problems with

1574
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,960
software

1575
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,520
and bring them back to what is

1576
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,280
traditionally the nano community

1577
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,280
excellent thank you tom d tom k

1578
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,559
you need me to read it for you uh no

1579
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,000
that's a great question

1580
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,520
um so one of the things was when i

1581
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,040
started i actually didn't start in

1582
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,920
service provider networks but i started

1583
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,920
enterprise

1584
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,920
and um you know a lot of these

1585
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,000
enterprise network engineers

1586
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,680
their mindset is there's one two or

1587
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,480
three of us in the department and that's

1588
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,720
about it

1589
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,839
and it wasn't until later on that i

1590
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,160
stumble upon

1591
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,520
um different groups and then eventually

1592
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,640
um figure out

1593
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,000
there's nan something as as nano so the

1594
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,200
enterprise world is definitely one of

1595
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,240
them and that's one of the things why we

1596
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,520
created um

1597
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,319
chicago nog uh if you look at that

1598
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,960
that demographic there it's almost

1599
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,960
mostly

1600
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,240
not what uh it's it's it's much

1601
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,319
different where it is

1602
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,040
local enterprise network engineers i

1603
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:59,680
think it's that group that we can

1604
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,040
attract as well to nanak and bring him

1605
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,118
in

1606
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,720
and i think that's um you know that's

1607
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,119
one of the reasons why i'm

1608
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,078
out having a reach to create local

1609
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,040
communities

1610
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,839
of network operators is key but the

1611
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,960
other part is

1612
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:18,240
obviously also from college having um

1613
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,920
college graduates enter the market um

1614
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,919
then having a job within the industry is

1615
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,520
huge within a service provider

1616
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,960
i think by having an opportunity to

1617
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,200
provide a job board

1618
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,440
again that would help significantly to

1619
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,439
grow

1620
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,280
excellent thank you and finally sean

1621
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,559
would you like me to read that or are

1622
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,079
you good

1623
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:37,760
i'm good with that but i think tina's

1624
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,200
also after me

1625
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:44,160
on this question tina started it

1626
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,399
okay yeah all right great um you started

1627
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,520
it

1628
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,599
tina started it all right um so

1629
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,799
so there's been a real lot of great

1630
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,280
ideas expressed on this

1631
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:56,000
i think a key to really getting people

1632
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,200
engaged

1633
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,280
is interactivity and having uh

1634
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,200
nanog means something to them having

1635
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,920
internet working means something to them

1636
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,160
and i know a lot of us used to talk

1637
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,680
about how we could go and break networks

1638
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,680
and learned a lot of things through that

1639
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,759
and and so on

1640
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,960
but and today you can't do that on a

1641
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,319
production network

1642
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:20,960
uh although uh there are some networks

1643
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,200
in a more advanced way that uh break the

1644
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,720
networks to improve their procedures and

1645
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,960
have the redundancy of fallover to do

1646
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,279
that but your average user doesn't

1647
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,119
uh have that in their day job but they

1648
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,040
do have that in a home lab they do have

1649
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,280
it in a hackathon

1650
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,040
they do have it in other environments

1651
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,000
and we've had some success with the

1652
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,440
hackathon

1653
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,240
along with other programs and bringing

1654
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,760
new newcomers and a key part of it is it

1655
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,040
is interactive

1656
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,440
it's something where they learn a new

1657
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,119
job skill and so on and i think that's

1658
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,040
something that we could broaden

1659
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,799
our reach and bring in other

1660
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,240
organizations to work with us to do

1661
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,240
targeted hackathons

1662
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,640
uh and it looks like the time is short

1663
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,959
so uh i i think that's key

1664
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,319
is doing stuff that are interactive uh

1665
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,720
that engage people

1666
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:07,440
that bring new members that are active

1667
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,200
in the community and they bring

1668
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,640
people to the community just like all of

1669
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,799
us have brought a friend

1670
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,160
and brought others so thank you no

1671
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,359
problem and

1672
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,440
brad you finally get to go first um

1673
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,119
the final question for all of you guys

1674
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,720
strategically

1675
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,200
what do you think are the biggest

1676
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:30,319
opportunities or challenges

1677
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:34,240
for nanog as an organization

1678
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:35,359
wow okay of course i get this question

1679
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,200
to go first with

1680
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:41,119
ah so i think we've kind of covered it

1681
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,078
the questions that we've talked about so

1682
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,240
far

1683
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,520
kind of all fall into this and i feel

1684
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,799
like

1685
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,480
it where where is nano going where

1686
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,000
where are we going how do we make this

1687
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,359
to be one

1688
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,040
we've covered how do we make this an

1689
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,119
inclusive environment how do we bring

1690
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,480
the next generation of network engineers

1691
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,799
into the fold

1692
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,160
how do we grow the organization and

1693
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,319
provide something that

1694
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,920
still has value i think that's something

1695
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,759
that we should be asking ourselves every

1696
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,559
single day as an organization what have

1697
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,079
we done

1698
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,240
as a as an organization what have we

1699
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,079
done to make things

1700
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,520
better in our industry one thing i'm

1701
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,880
going to call it out i'm a little biased

1702
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,359
but it's there

1703
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,640
the program committee has been doing an

1704
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,558
amazing job

1705
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,160
i think that doesn't get called out

1706
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,400
enough with how much work

1707
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,680
that the team puts into reviewing all of

1708
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,400
the presentations

1709
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,200
i think that should just be called out

1710
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,200
on its own

1711
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,799
because we need to continue providing

1712
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,520
content that is going to bring

1713
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:38,640
more people in it's going to allow them

1714
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,640
to grow

1715
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,480
and provides a place where we can help

1716
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:45,200
them grow their careers as well

1717
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,000
great thank you so much brad uh vincent

1718
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,960
would you like me to read that again

1719
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,559
uh yes please absolutely strategically

1720
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,680
what do you think are the biggest

1721
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,599
opportunities

1722
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,319
and challenges for nanak as an

1723
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,319
organization

1724
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,160
you know i i'm not going to necessarily

1725
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,078
steal brad but

1726
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,759
again that that definitely is

1727
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,440
the best opportunity and something that

1728
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,520
we need to improve on again

1729
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,720
the next generation as well as diversity

1730
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,759
and inclusion

1731
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:17,759
um again

1732
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,119
having led the the pc especially during

1733
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,799
this time of we'll call it uncertainty

1734
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,359
the first impression that everyone gets

1735
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:28,240
that's new to the nano community

1736
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,759
is the meetings themselves so i i mean i

1737
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,558
was actually struggling last night

1738
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,839
because that

1739
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:35,520
the pca is the heart and soul um and

1740
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,960
again that is the first impression that

1741
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:41,599
everyone gets from nanag

1742
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,280
and i think it starts there so as a

1743
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,760
board i think we would have to

1744
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,559
again encourage and guide that

1745
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,400
throughout

1746
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:53,839
the year thank you very much

1747
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,839
vincent um tom d

1748
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,200
you want me to read it no thank you

1749
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,720
kendra um

1750
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,359
so i think nanog has a couple

1751
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,480
different key commitments that it makes

1752
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:09,119
and

1753
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,240
ensuring that we remain true to these

1754
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,960
key commitments

1755
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,759
are opportunities that we have so first

1756
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,079
and foremost nanog is a 501c3

1757
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,040
non-profit organization with

1758
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:24,480
fundamentally an educational mission

1759
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:26,480
uh which uh

1760
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,839
you know aligns to our conversation that

1761
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,240
we've had about

1762
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,880
engaging you know the next generation of

1763
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,520
network

1764
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,799
operator engineer software developer

1765
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,880
connected to networking

1766
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,240
right so i think that that opportunity

1767
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,319
remains and it's something that we need

1768
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,399
to continue to work upon

1769
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,480
um another opportunity that's in front

1770
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,119
of us is as others have said to make

1771
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,040
sure that

1772
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,480
every stakeholder at nanog and there's a

1773
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,759
variety of stakeholders

1774
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,319
in our community whether it be existing

1775
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,000
members

1776
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:57,440
newcoming members sponsors volunteers

1777
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,240
how do we as a board make sure that

1778
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:02,319
everyone is deriving value and benefit

1779
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,000
uh from what we're getting from nanohog

1780
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,640
and in terms of challenges i mean i

1781
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,200
think that

1782
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,920
our biggest challenge right now uh maybe

1783
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
there's two

1784
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,440
certainly there's the short-term

1785
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,640
challenge which is you know covid

1786
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,720
how do we continue to run our

1787
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,078
organization in these times the longer

1788
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,520
term challenge is how do we stay

1789
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,920
relevant to this community

1790
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,799
and make sure that we're addressing the

1791
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:26,079
community's needs on an ongoing basis

1792
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:27,599
thank you tom uh d tom k would you like

1793
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,599
me to read it or are you good

1794
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,640
i got it um so in terms of the

1795
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,280
opportunity i'll talk about the

1796
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,720
opportunity

1797
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,680
um i think nanak has has a it's a very

1798
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,759
interesting place

1799
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,680
a very beneficial place um that can take

1800
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,359
advantage of um because when you look at

1801
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,359
you know there's colleges that

1802
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:45,200
teach you the theory of networking you

1803
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:47,119
know there's vendor certifications that

1804
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,839
teach you how do you actually configure

1805
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,920
this

1806
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:51,520
um but in the middle of that i think

1807
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,480
that's where nana comes in

1808
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,280
and i think uh you know nana basically

1809
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,000
uh come in

1810
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,280
and could tell you uh you know how the

1811
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,280
actual internet is built

1812
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,480
by the people that build it uh you know

1813
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,799
you could be sitting in a

1814
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,559
in a conference uh next to someone you

1815
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:08,319
don't know that wrote a bunch of rfcs or

1816
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,880
built one of the largest isps

1817
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,558
um and you know that that's that's the

1818
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,680
big opportunity that nano has

1819
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:17,680
and how does that how does nanak provide

1820
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,598
that to this community and you know

1821
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,598
one way could be why not have a

1822
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:23,920
certification program where

1823
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,760
there's a nano certification where it's

1824
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,520
not the vendor-specific

1825
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,799
uh certification how to do something and

1826
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,040
it's not that the theory

1827
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,640
how does something work but actually how

1828
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,240
it was built and how it's deployed and

1829
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,440
how it's used and operated

1830
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,359
and i think that's the biggest

1831
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,160
opportunity that nanak has

1832
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:41,839
not to provide excellent thank you uh

1833
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,598
sean

1834
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:45,520
yeah so first of all i want to say that

1835
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,359
the next board that comes in is going to

1836
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,280
face some challenges

1837
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,799
because the the impact from covet is not

1838
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,000
just a short-term

1839
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:56,720
change nanog books his hotels out

1840
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,559
three years we have significant

1841
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,919
financial liabilities

1842
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:04,799
we've been working to build a fund

1843
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,000
to cover for rainy day and covet has

1844
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,200
sort of stopped progress on

1845
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,480
that uh so it is important for

1846
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:14,160
us to not only think about what we can

1847
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,359
do

1848
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:20,240
but do them well come up with goals and

1849
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:22,000
metrics for these programs

1850
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,359
on the board we see we see lots of

1851
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,079
offers or programs

1852
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:27,200
and so on let's make good decisions

1853
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,599
let's back them

1854
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,598
let's do them well and then we need to

1855
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,400
come up with sponsorship models

1856
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,359
to support that and finally on top of

1857
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,920
all that

1858
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,920
we got to come back to what we're about

1859
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,720
keep it focused on education

1860
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,000
keep it focused on engineers that's what

1861
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,959
we've done in the past

1862
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
that's what i'd like to see whoever's

1863
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,839
elected on this board

1864
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,520
does in the future excellent uh

1865
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,960
tina would you like me to read that for

1866
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,920
you again no

1867
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,960
i think i have this one got it for

1868
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,720
challenges

1869
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,400
uh as sean you know just touched on um

1870
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,799
her biggest challenge right now is not

1871
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,280
going bankrupt you know to be honest

1872
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:10,880
um our revenue stream and sponsorship

1873
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,839
streams are challenging to maintain

1874
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,280
right now

1875
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:18,319
um we do have um a fund but it's not

1876
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,280
endless and um we're lucky the board

1877
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:21,119
before us saw

1878
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,319
it to put that in place because we did

1879
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,559
it much sooner

1880
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,680
and you know is a very pragmatic thing

1881
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,920
to do

1882
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,319
um also you know we have some great

1883
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,280
ideas but we have an incredibly small

1884
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:34,640
staff

1885
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:38,000
you know we have six people total

1886
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,038
you know it's it's not endless and

1887
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,720
you know they spend a lot of time

1888
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,559
running these meetings and we can hire

1889
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,279
contractors and whatnot

1890
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,839
but it's we have to really think about

1891
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,160
what

1892
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,279
is possible and these are huge meetings

1893
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,078
a huge um

1894
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,200
community that we're working with um so

1895
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,839
you know at different times we've

1896
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,359
considered

1897
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:57,119
additional staff and things and when it

1898
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,078
makes sense we'll add that but you know

1899
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,240
that's not really

1900
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,200
a cost we we need to undertake at this

1901
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,799
time

1902
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,240
um this meeting has grown in the last

1903
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,920
few years from a

1904
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,680
pretty consistently three to four

1905
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,680
hundred person meeting to over a

1906
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,279
thousand people on a regular basis

1907
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,279
we've also gone through the change of an

1908
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:18,160
executive director we've launched a new

1909
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,480
website we've done a lot with this with

1910
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,960
this

1911
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,000
very small staff i think there's there's

1912
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,480
ready to go

1913
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
um but i think our biggest opportunity

1914
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,079
is coming from this hybrid model

1915
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,119
like we've talked about in this these

1916
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,119
gaps in

1917
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,880
that we can get more attendees from

1918
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,960
different varied walks of life

1919
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,240
um to attend that weren't able to before

1920
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,839
and we so

1921
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,279
one of my biggest drives on the board

1922
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:42,078
has been to professionalize

1923
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,000
and standardize how we do everything so

1924
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,119
that's transparent to anybody that

1925
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,640
volunteers for

1926
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:50,480
for a committee or anything that they do

1927
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,640
that can be done the same way so the

1928
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,559
community knows what to expect from us

1929
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,480
also it's important to reach out every

1930
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,400
time there's an opportunity to volunteer

1931
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,240
and reach out to our entire committee

1932
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,520
or our entire community not just the

1933
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,879
people we know

1934
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,680
and start bringing people and to

1935
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,119
participate from all the groups

1936
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,558
um i think we have a lot of

1937
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,799
opportunities to take what we've learned

1938
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,799
and really improve things

1939
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:14,160
excellent well thank you guys all for

1940
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:15,599
your questions since i

1941
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,000
didn't give you your time at the

1942
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:20,319

1943
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,400

ahead and i'm going to

1945
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,839
start with vincent again and just give

1946
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,839
30 seconds whatever your anything you'd

1947
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:32,558
like to share with the community

1948
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,880
that you believe would make you a great

1949
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,200
uh

1950
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,280
board member in 30 seconds it's the

1951
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,000
speed round

1952
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,440
thanks kendra no no pressure at all uh i

1953
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,359
just wanted to say you know my diverse

1954
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,839
background having experience in both uh

1955
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:46,558
we'll call it operating networks as well

1956
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,319
as

1957
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:49,920
the business side of things working for

1958
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,440
a vendor i think that brings me a unique

1959
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,640
perspective that we need to consider

1960
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,160
everything as well

1961
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,319
it was mentioned you know our

1962
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,680
classification as an organization

1963
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,680
but i think my leadership skills have

1964
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,960
been demonstrated as a chair of the

1965
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,839
program committee organizing and

1966
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,000
motivating

1967
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,520
fantastic group of volunteers i hope to

1968
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,400
be able to bring the same skill set

1969
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,799
enthusiasm

1970
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,559
and dedication to the board thank you

1971
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:13,359
excellent and you are spot on

1972
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,880
tom d let's see how well you do all

1973
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,839
right let's see if we can hit the speed

1974
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,599
round

1975
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:19,920
so what i want to say is that in life we

1976
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,960
have um a few forms of equity that we

1977
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,039
get to work with

1978
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,720
uh that consists of our time and our

1979
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,880
treasure and our talent

1980
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,078
um and at this stage of my career i'm

1981
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,760
really lucky

1982
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,599
and able to be in a position where i can

1983
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,000
invest time into nanog

1984
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:35,520
so as a board board member i think my

1985
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
contributions will be to continue to

1986
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,240
elevate the profile of the organization

1987
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,599
to ensure that we meet our commitments

1988
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,240
and i want to emphasize those

1989
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:44,720
commitments

1990
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,720
as an education organization that

1991
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,919
networks together the next generation of

1992
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,038
professionals

1993
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,960
and to run a proper trustworthy and

1994
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,400
inclusive organization

1995
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,480

01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,280
and not bringing people together to

2002
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,640
learn from each other

2003

with our community

2032

2034
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,280
