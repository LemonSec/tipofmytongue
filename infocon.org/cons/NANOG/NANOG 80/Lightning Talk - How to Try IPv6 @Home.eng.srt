00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,879
hello everyone

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,920
thank you for the opportunity to present

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,400
my epi version 6

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,000
home network project i'd like to thank

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
nanook program committee

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
for selecting my lighting poll my name

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,720
is jordan

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
and i work at slumberj at a network

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,479
engineer

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,279
as you can see on the right i'm also a

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,119
hurricane electric ipv56 enthusiast

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,359
you can also certify your iphone 6

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,119
ability there too

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
this project requires zero programming

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,239
skills

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,840
because the only programming skill i

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,839
have currently is cisco cli

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,680
let's start with the ipv6 adoption rate

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,160
at 52 percent united states is still

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,399
fall behind india at 69 percent and

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,839
belgium at 59 percent

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,960
but we are in front of the rest of the

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,360
world why the lack of production

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,120
well in my opinion many enterprises

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,840
still can't see the immediate benefit

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,839
to adopt opinion 6. this causes many

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
internet providers hesitate to provide

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
appearances as well

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,240
there are also unforeseen potential

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,360
security vulnerabilities and

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,600
from using application 6 and there is

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,159
still a lack of support in many popular

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,360
web and mobile applications as well as

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,799
smart devices

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,799
like smart tv for example

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,399
let's start with a brief introduction to

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,119
episode 6. this is a picture of

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,159
ayanna ivyan six address based in a pie

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,680
chart

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,400
approximately 85 percent of the ipv6

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,799
address space

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,520
is reserved for future definition and

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,280
use

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,280
and it's not to be assigned by iana so

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
there are still a lot of available space

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
in the 15

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,919
that we are using so this is the

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,560
background

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,000
of the pie chart zero zero zero is used

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
by unspecified

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,079
loopback and embedded application for

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,798
address

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,000
001 is obviously used by global unicast

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,119
address

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,160
01.1 is used by net64 well-known prefix

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,239
one is used by unique local unicast link

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
local unicast and multicast

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,520
we still have untouched space in zero

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
one zero

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
one zero zero one zero one and one one

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,640
zero

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,399
and still a lot of space in zero zero

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,440
zero

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,640
zero one one and one one one

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,160
reserved for future use

67
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,839
i mean i'm gonna skip this part because

68
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
this is just a breakdown of the previous

69
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,000
slide

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,599
so the easiest method to try ever since

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,959
ipv6 at home

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,640
is user is using dual stack which means

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,319
use both iphone 6 and 4 altogether

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,760
if your isp support dhcp version 6 with

75
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,839
prefix delegation option

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,799
use it if your home router modem

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,760
does not support the sap physics pd like

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,159
in my case

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,799
my netgear router modem doesn't support

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,799
it

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
make it as a bridge and use another

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,000
capable router

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,000
behind it this is the workflow picture

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
so back in december 2019 i was looking

85
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,079
for the most

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,680
cost effective and reliable solution

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
after doing several research i pick

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,799
ubiquity because

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,679
it's based on viator linux no actually

90
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,920
because it's the most

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,959
portable utm solution in the market

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,359
disclaimer

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,519
i'm not endorsing a specific vendor here

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,159
i selected my equipment because they are

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,760
the least expensive option to conduct my

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,239
experiment

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,920
so here's the breakdown 100 to this

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,720
dollar for the usg

99
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
another 100 for the controller or 100

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,760
for the access point

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
and then two raspberry pi's for my

102
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,679
internal and external services

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,120
like dns server network monitoring web

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
server etc

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,400
and of course we i need a password

106
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
manager because

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,480
i'm going to create a lot of credentials

108
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,119
for each of these devices

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,319
and just for fun host a website in

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
raspberry pi

111
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,879
and point a dns name using google domain

112
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,200
name here

113
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,719
so my comcast internet connection is 100

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,880
mbps in and out

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,600
of vsp and 500ps out that's why i use

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,000
this if you have 1gbps recognition you

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,680
might consider udm pro

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,759
which supports 10 gbps connection

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,360
if you have if you want a more stable

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,520
connection than wireless

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
nowadays my switches are cheap i picked

122
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,479
tp link

123
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,799
when i switch because it's only cost 30

124
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
usd

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
as you can see i have space constraint

126
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,400
in my apartment for this project i'm

127
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,119
using

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,320
just a small space on top of my drawer

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,880
right beside my smart tv

130
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
so here are the features of my raspberry

131
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,880
pi's

132
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,120
so the first raspberry pi's uh

133
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,759
serve dns server using pi hole cacti

134
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,960
for a network monitoring tool and an

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,160
easy rsa

136
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,120
certificate server for hosting my https

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
website

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,680
and then second raspberry pi uh provide

139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,880
open vpn web server

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,160
apache 2 web server less encrypt for my

141
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,120
tps website

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,520
and firewall and in both i use file to

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
ban

144
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,919
and passwordless method to access the

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,919
then using ssh

146
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
as you can see here my pi holes shows

147
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,560
that

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,960
27 of my home network traffic is ipv6

149
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,080
most of them are ipads iphones and my

150
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,080
home windows 10 laptop

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,719
as you can see here cacti is still

152
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
powerful and easy to set up based on

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,960
snmp

154
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
i can see my one interpersonalization

155
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,120
here and

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,120
my cpu and memory utilization over time

157
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,319
as you can see here linux commands on my

158
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,600
firewall

159
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:11,680
to check my iphone 6 interfaces

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
neighbors route and pings

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
the left hand side is my windows 10

162
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,000
laptop iphone 6

163
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,919
verification this is simply ipconfig and

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
this is simply stress route minus 6 to

165
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,318
facebook.com

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,199
and the right the right hand side is

167
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:34,319
my iphone traceroute to google.com using

168
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:38,160
hurricane electric network tools

169
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:42,960
so using tcp dump on the usg

170
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:46,319
i can capture my phone facebook traffic

171
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,000
so i found out that

172
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,800
my facebook app chose uh ipv16 over

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
episode 4.

174
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,638
so as i mentioned before my home website

175
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,759
using raspberry pi exposed both ipv6 4

176
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,440
and

177
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:08,560
and i set up a cisco http ipsl a

178
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,719
pro from my company towards both uh

179
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
i've seen four and six addresses and as

180
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
you can see here over time the web

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
performance looks similar

182
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,520
conclusion so in terms of web

183
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,199
performance iphone 6 is similar to

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,479
evolution 4.

185
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,560
you might be surprised that you already

186
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,520
use ib56 in your phones without you

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,560
knowing it

188
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,159
just google search what is my ip

189
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,080
and if you're in the united states

190
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,360
chances are you're already using a vpn

191
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
six to run google maps

192
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
search etc number two it will be cool if

193
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
all internet providers in north america

194
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
can provide ibm 6

195
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,799
with no additional cost i still find

196
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,680
enterprise isps

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,360
don't currently support it number three

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,879
adding security features at home

199
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,840
can be a reasonable justification to

200
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,680
purchase the required devices

201
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,919
number four you'll have fun and learn a

202
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,919
lot

203
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
