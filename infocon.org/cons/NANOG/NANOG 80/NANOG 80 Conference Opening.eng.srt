00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,960
and meet all you all in person on our

174
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,360
home turf but

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,120
virtual is better than nothing and we

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,759
are still proud to be the meeting host

177
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,759
of this event

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
um so amazon maybe as you know operates

179
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,799
a pretty significant infrastructure all

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,319
over the world

181
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,319
we have a pretty cool site which we

182
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,400
would like to kind of advertise on this

183
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,639
on this um this internship is

184
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,318
infrastructure.aws

185
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,759
which we try to keep updated with

186
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,919
everything we're doing

187
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,280
and we would like this opportunity to

188
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,000
give you a little bit more insight on

189
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,479
what we have been

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,120
doing since the last time we met um

191
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,520
so most of us most of you probably met

192
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
us that

193
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,479
in february at an honor in san francisco

194
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
and one of the things we've been

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,840
focusing on on 2020 is

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,719
rpki today we have about 99 coverage

197
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,799
of our rp space with roas with a full

198
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
automated system in the back

199
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
so bring our own ip customers are

200
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
enforced to use rpki to even onboard to

201
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,440
the cloud and this is something we're

202
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,039
very proud of

203
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,599
proud of and i guess as a non-exclusive

204
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,520
we will also do rpki origin validation

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,039
where invalid will be dropped

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
everywhere in the border within six

207
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,960
months today we already have a couple of

208
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,680
sites that are doing this

209
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,120
and also for for others it could be

210
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,880
worth mentioning that rpki

211
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,360
and ov will be something that we all

212
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,360
will also put in contracts going forward

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,800
um so for transit operators and other

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,800
type of operators this is

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
uh hopefully a wake-up call going

216
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
forward

217
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,039
we have a couple of new locations we

218
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,719
would like to talk about so a new

219
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,440
regions we're building them in

220
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,199
in osaka in japan we have indonesia we

221
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,680
have spain coming up

222
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,960
south africa bahrain and italy is

223
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
already open

224
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,919
and we have a couple of new edge pops

225
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,479
where we would love to pair with

226
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,520
everyone

227
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,639
uh so we have mexico colombia chile

228
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,359
croatia estonia and kenya new zealand is

229
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,120
also up

230
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
and you know as we say on amazon this is

231
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,759
just day one so there's definitely

232
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,599
more sites to come um something that's

233
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,560
been discussed frequently on auto

234
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,199
is the velocity of how we set up piers

235
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
this is

236
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,680
not unheard of we we got the message for

237
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,639
sure

238
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,360
so during 2020 we have been doing a

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,799
project to

240
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,479
speed up ix turn ups so hopefully

241
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,000
just in the last couple of months people

242
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,640
hopefully have noticed this and actually

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,958
gets served properly over ixs

244
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
going into 2021 we will have a project

245
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,838
to speed up the pi velocity setup

246
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,439
process as well

247
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,200
uh which will hopefully be the benefit

248
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,720
to all of us uh

249
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
peering communications has also been

250
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
something that's been discussed on not

251
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,600
on mailing lists and on irc and on other

252
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,959
mediums

253
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
we have a new strategy we have a new

254
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,479
team and we would encourage everyone to

255
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
get new contact details

256
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,200

257
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,839
separate emails for technical inquiries

258
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,959
policies and maintenance notifications

259
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,279
so please check that out

260
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,880
we also have a new public page for just

261
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680

262
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,640
aws

263
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,920
so it's on peering.aws uh so please

264
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,279
check that out there will be more

265
