you know i'm very happy to come to you

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,320

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,320
i really wish we were in person just

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,480
like i think many other people

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,600
would be i'm here to talk to you about

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
uh why

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,680
i had to start a telephone company or

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,519
how i actually got high-speed internet

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,960
access to my house

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,198
so quick background uh i moved to my

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,040
current house in 2002

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,480
uh you know it's right on the outskirts

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,120
of ann arbor michigan

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,718
uh and at the time you know uh it was

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
great the people who i worked for they

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,960
provided me a t1

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
uh to uh the local pop and you know and

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
back in 2002

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
you know a megabit symmetric megabit and

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,879
a half symmetric

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,120
uh you know was was really you know

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,718
still relatively decent considering uh

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,800
you know a lot of the technology options

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,440
that were out there at the time

29
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,879
uh you know and you know for for

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
everything that you know we're kind of

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,519
expecting

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,438
you expect uh development around you

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,119
know cities and ann arbor is one of the

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,960
cities where it's been slowly growing

35
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,240
outward for a number of years

36
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,919
uh and people are putting in new

37
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,960
subdivisions and stuff and i kind of

38
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,600
expected that

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,360
you know with uh stuff like cable moving

40
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,320
from one way to two-way cable systems

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,240
dsl

42
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,600
uh people starting to talk talk about

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,280
fiber to the home

44
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,360
uh you know those types of services

45
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,600
would reach uh the location

46
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,479
you know where i lived but the reality

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,158
is

48
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,960
nothing actually came out here uh and

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,880
you know today i'm still about you know

50
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,240
a little bit over two miles away from

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,520
you know the existing service areas

52
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,039
where you can actually get high-speed

53
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,039
internet

54
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
so where do i live on the west side of

55
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,159
ann arbor no

56
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
you keep going further west you keep

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,439
going further west and then

58
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,360
you know i guess the way you'd really

59
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,520
describe it is farm adjacent

60
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,600
so i live where that you know little

61
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,280
yellow pin is you can all now uh

62
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,960
you know find my house on google earth

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,880
if you wanted uh and

64
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,320
this is a screenshot of kind of what it

65
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,479
looked like back in the day

66
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,679
and you can see an upper in the upper

67
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,679
left-hand corner you'll

68
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,119
uh you know and through the area over

69
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,640
the years you'll actually see the

70
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
development pop in

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,920
uh you know out in these areas where you

72
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
know it could be reasonably expected

73
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,760
these farms are being developed

74
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,440
and that eventually services are are

75
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
going to go and

76
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,480
show up and come into the town uh you

77
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
know

78
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,399
come and connect into where i live uh

79
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,760
you know and then you start to get to

80
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
you know recent days we've got new

81
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
subdivisions and new developments going

82
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,560
in

83
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,319
grocery stores hardware stores and stuff

84
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
so i've got this problem

85
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,879
creates conflict i really have no high

86
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,599
speed internet

87
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
am i am i going to move you know i'm uh

88
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,920
you know the seller obviously pays

89
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,280
commission

90
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,958
uh you know so there's actually a

91
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,480
significant cost for me to move i did a

92
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,160
financial analysis of this

93
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,920
actually to figure out okay how much

94
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
would it actually cost me to move

95
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,920
you know in uh fixing up the home

96
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
getting it ready for being sold

97
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,518
uh etc but also how much money am i

98
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,959
going to lose in moving

99
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,040
we actually kind of like the house that

100
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,120
we live in and the location and stuff

101
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,560
and what you actually find is a lot of

102
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
these homes out in

103
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,480
rural communities they're actually

104
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
devalued because there's no high speed

105
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,599
uh internet access available if you go

106
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,799
talk to realtors

107
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,720
or if you've gone home shopping

108
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,360
yourselves and you say oh no high speed

109
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
internet

110
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
you know just in the same way that we in

111
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,480
this community would treat it a lot of

112
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,120
actually uh smart consumers are doing

113
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,440
that

114
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,799
so at least for a while i had a wireless

115
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
isp

116
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,360
that came to my temporary rescue and i

117
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,400
had i got about 50 megabit service from

118
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,000
him for uh

119
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,360
you know for 10 years so what's a geek

120
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,040
like me supposed to do

121
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
i know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna start

122
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,798
a telephone company

123
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,798
so you get around get up you file a

124
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
tariff and hopefully one day i'm gonna

125
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,599
profit from this

126
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,120
so let me give you some more details

127
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,798
because there's a lot of details and

128
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
planning that goes into this

129
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,319
you've got to identify who your

130
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
customers are internet access how you're

131
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,839
going to do construction

132
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,920
you know find the contractors you know

133
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,439
you go on fiber locator or one of the

134
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,399
other types of services out there and

135
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
find things

136
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,920
you know you spend a lot of time doing

137
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,399
research planning trying to

138
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
piece together all the finances and then

139
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
you know i actually even went out and i

140
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,478
started pre-building fiber

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,279
as early as 2018 and i started to

142
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,478
connect the

143
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,638
the the wireless isp customers

144
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,479
who were actually hanging off of my home

145
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,400
my home actually hosted the uh

146
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,919
the antenna the micro pop or whatever

147
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,919
you want to call it

148
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,758
for my street and i actually went i

149
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,799
started to connect those people

150
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,680
uh to my home

151
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
directly with fiber in order to provide

152
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
access

153
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,639
and to provide a way for uh you know

154
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,719
them to have good reliable service as

155
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,960
wireless interference as more people

156
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,479
uh started turning on devices made that

157
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,719
a lot harder

158
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,320
you know so what do you do you look up

159
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,040
your access your costs

160
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
today uh you know this is a snapshot of

161
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,320
the website

162
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
uh this is uh i verified this a couple

163
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
days ago it's still

164
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,198
uh i can get one and a half megabits

165
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,240
they uh

166
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,520
you know for roughly about 39 40

167
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,320
you know 40 a month uh you know i talked

168
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
to uh

169
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,080
you know different providers about

170
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,400
getting access to me comcast was

171
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,120
actually remarkably the easiest to work

172
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,599
with

173
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,120
uh they could actually get me a quote

174
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,759
and say this is what it would actually

175
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,199
go

176
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,400
uh and cost to extend the network uh

177
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,400
their network to my home and uh you know

178
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,159
could give me a price and a number that

179
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,159
i could actually go around

180
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,680
to talk to my other neighbors and say

181
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
hey i'm willing to pay some amount of

182
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
this

183
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
are any of you interested in paying some

184
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,320
money for this

185
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,360
uh and turned out that was no you know i

186
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,719
wasn't going to pay

187
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,800
you know a a bill for 50 000 uh

188
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,919
personally as a you know as a single

189
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
home uh

190
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,000
you know that starts to hit that range

191
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,160
where it actually makes a bit of sense

192
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,800
to say okay no really maybe moving is

193
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,280
actually the right choice

194
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,560
so i started doing a lot more research i

195
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,080
played around with active ethernet

196
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
solutions i got

197
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,639
uh distributors to sell me hardware from

198
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,318
zone and play with that i go and i

199
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,400
you know start playing around with gpon

200
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,280
i have a nice lab down in my

201
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,080
uh my basement of all places uh i'm

202
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,039
actually using the uh the unifi solution

203
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,240
uh you know they've got the ufo lt um

204
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,919
you know it's pretty nice

205
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,600
and then the next thing you do which is

206
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,599
really important is you start marketing

207
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
you have to go and engage in active

208
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,360
marketing and tell people

209
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
hey i'm building this uh you know so

210
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
talk to many people

211
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,960
uh i actually went and i mailed letters

212
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,520
to a lot of these potential subscribers

213
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,080
and the research it really never ends i

214
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,599
talk to

215
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,199
a lot of other you know service

216
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,759
providers who are doing fiber to the

217
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
home

218
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,880
i talk to people you know all around the

219
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
world uh

220
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,599
talk to community groups a little uh you

221
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,479
know isp cooperatives

222
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,520
uh you know uh in my area who are trying

223
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,000
to do something

224
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,039
uh we have a local uh township here that

225
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,520
actually passed a

226
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,280
uh a millage to basically provide

227
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
universal service to they have got about

228
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,840
a thousand homes or something in the

229
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,759
township

230
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,119
uh and and they they're one of the only

231
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,120
ones in the state of michigan who was

232
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,080
able to do this and actually fund it

233
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,800
with uh with tax dollars to go and

234
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,800
offset

235
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,080
offset the build costs associated with

236
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,520
that um

237
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
and and i talked to all the people who

238
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
are involved in that and try to figure

239
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
out

240
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,198
okay what works you know what's viable

241
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,880
and really also understand the

242
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,680
competitive landscape that i was looking

243
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,520
at

244
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,840
so what do you do you start spending

245
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,599
some money uh i bought a fusion splicer

246
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,679
actually back in 2016.

247
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,400
i actually bought some of that initial

248
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,880
fiber that i've been using back in 2017

249
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,599
you know i got my ot first otdr back in

250
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,919
2018

251
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,759
you know jared's jared's first otdr

252
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,080
which definitely makes things uh

253
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,440
you know uh makes it a lot easier to

254
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,639
troubleshoot when something goes wrong

255
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,960
with that fiber

256
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
uh and stuff and then i started spending

257
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,479
a whole bunch of money i spent

258
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
on design and permitting got master

259
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
plans got the tariffs filed

260
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
i actually had to join you know the

261
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,199
8-1-1 in michigan we called the mystic

262
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,639
system

263
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,720
uh you know i know a lot of other places

264
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,720
call it one call or something else

265
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,479
and then you know last year in april i

266
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
actually filed for my permit

267
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,919
and went round and round with the

268
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,440
permitting agency

269
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,039
uh and stuff on all of the little

270
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,639
details that needed to be done

271
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,400
and i ultimately got my permit in

272
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,639
september of last year

273
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,440
well that went and pushed my build

274
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,840
schedule

275
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,840
firmly into 2020 because when you get

276
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,960
into the fall the construction costs at

277
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,399
least up here

278
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,838
uh where we get snow and and stuff

279
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,159
a lot of the construction costs are

280
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,479
based on access to things like water

281
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,120
uh uh and materials like that which you

282
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,120
actually need to uh to run the equipment

283
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
uh and as it gets colder obviously that

284
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,320
becomes a lot harder uh

285
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,040
you know and we've already had a couple

286
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
good not not real hard freezes

287
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,959
this year already but we've had uh

288
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,479
definitely frost out in the morning

289
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
and that that's made the local water

290
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,240
guys not want to you know in the spring

291
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,680
that made them not want me to give me a

292
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,959
meter so i could get water out of the

293
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,160
hydrants

294
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,040
uh at that time so what do i do

295
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,480
i try to spend spread out of the cost so

296
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,640
you know i went i used thing

297
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,360
you know used money that i got you know

298
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,199
over time be it bonuses or other things

299
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,440
uh to go and spread out those costs to

300
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,080
actually uh make that work

301
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
i found you know local distributors uh

302
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
national distributors to sell me the

303
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,399
underground

304
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the right underground supplies um and

305
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
and spent a little bit here a little bit

306
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,839
there

307
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
and it really goes a long way when

308
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,959
you're starting to get all the planning

309
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
uh and stuff done and i went i did some

310
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,199
stuff and i said okay yeah this is

311
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,240
probably going to be about a

312
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
60 000 project for me to do which is why

313
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,519
you know the 50

314
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,079
000 for comcast you know and other

315
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,480
things

316
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,720
uh and it costs to move really made me

317
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,040
say no this is this is probably the

318
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,680
right thing to do

319
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,360
so had to line up all sorts of stuff you

320
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,640
know you line up bonus money you don't

321
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
know what you're going to need so

322
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,680
you know you do things like home equity

323
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,199
line of credit

324
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,279
uh because that has certain tax

325
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
advantages uh depending on how much you

326
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,720
earn

327
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
uh you know i lined up customer money

328
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,640
one of the one of the things that was

329
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,920
great

330
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,240
is uh there's these guys uh in michigan

331
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,000
in virgins township called uh virgins

332
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,000
broadband or vb fiber

333
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600
uh the guy there was really helpful for

334
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,040
me he went and

335
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,360
shared the business model that worked

336
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
well for him where customers

337
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,720
would actually help offset those upfront

338
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,399
build costs uh

339
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,760
and so if you are willing to pay five

340
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,480
thousand dollars up front

341
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,079
you get fifty dollars off credit for 100

342
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,200
months off your bill

343
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,279
and that's something that he found

344
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
actually worked and resonated with

345
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,760
people

346
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,120
uh i made sure you know when we drew up

347
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,880
paperwork for this that it stayed with

348
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
the property so if you sell the home

349
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,240
you know that credit stays there i don't

350
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,399
just get to keep it as you know even

351
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,320
though i'm a telephone company i'm not a

352
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,440
uh you know i'm not necessarily an evil

353
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,519
one uh

354
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,040
but it also keeps the customer paying

355
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,839
something so you do have some recurring

356
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,079
revenue

357
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,839
over that customer life cycle uh and it

358
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,239
really helps offset those startup costs

359
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,360
which

360
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
you know i found out were quite

361
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,920
significant so

362
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
what did i do i sat down i actually drew

363
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,079
up

364
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,760
uh you know a spreadsheet with

365
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,120
month-by-month run rate of

366
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,279
everything that it would cost me over uh

367
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,800
over the time of the project and figured

368
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,480
out okay

369
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,560
how how much money am i actually going

370
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,920
to put out because i have to put out all

371
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,599
this money

372
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
i was able to get labor down to seven

373
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
and a quarter a foot

374
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,199
which is actually really good i got two

375
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,040
conduits buried underground for that

376
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,760
for that labor cost that drove up my

377
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,719
conduit cost getting two conduits but

378
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,519
that was really worthwhile uh it you

379
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
know it's

380
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
something where it was only an extra

381
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,200
quarter a foot to do that

382
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,079
but in doing this spreadsheet i was able

383
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
to then go

384
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,519
and spell out okay how much money do i

385
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,160
need to pay

386
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,760
when so i can understand you know how to

387
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,880
budget everything out

388
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,519
and then i actually put in all the

389
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,959
customer models okay

390
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,240
how much money am i going to lose how

391
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,399
much am i going to spend what's that

392
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
going to look like month by month

393
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,079
and by going out and doing a lot of

394
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,320
these pre-installations i had built-in

395
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,519
customers

396
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,480
into the revenue model on day one and so

397
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,399
that allowed me to

398
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,639
actually reach a cash flow positive

399
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,240
position very very quickly

400
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,160
which is really essential for a business

401
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,920
such that you're not continuing to spend

402
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,800
money

403
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,240
that you don't have and continue to run

404
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
yourself in debt which is uh

405
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,920
definitely a trap a lot of businesses

406
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
end up in

407
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,199
so this financially modeling modeling

408
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,040
really really important

409
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,639
you know it put together what my run

410
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,719
rate was uh

411
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,240
put my forecast for full year expenses

412
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,160
all the things that come up

413
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,800
uh you know kind of irregularly like

414
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,880
insurance and the 8-1-1 system causes

415
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,319
costs but also the forecast for

416
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,720
unexpected expenses

417
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,480
you know repairs disputes any sort of

418
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,839
refunds or bad debt that i may have to

419
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,720
absorb as well

420
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,079
uh you know can can be factored into

421
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,440
into that model

422
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,359
um so uh you know i mentioned a little

423
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,720
bit about you know these pre-builds

424
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
uh you know i worked with the existing

425
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,040
wireless isp i said hey i'm gonna

426
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,279
hook hook these people up with fiber i'm

427
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,519
going to do it at my expense

428
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,279
going to be pre-wired pre-constructed

429
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,279
and i said you continue to retain these

430
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,320
people their customer revenue until such

431
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,279
time as

432
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,000
i was actually live with my service but

433
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,920
you know i

434
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,680
also got to build out rack space and

435
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,880
fiber distribution and patch panels and

436
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,040
stuff

437
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,639
in in my house in order to terminate

438
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,240
stuff i actually got a whole home

439
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
generator as part of this project to

440
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,800
make sure that i have

441
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,920
uh stand up backup power and stamp and

442
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,000
everything is automatic for uh

443
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,240
when the service uh you know when the

444
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,880
electrical service is interrupted

445
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,639
so what's an install look like uh here

446
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,240
i've got a couple photos of what that

447
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,680
looks like on the side of the home

448
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
i've got you know a little media

449
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,239
converter you've got the fiber drop

450
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,000
coming up to the home

451
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,839
then you also have you know the uh a

452
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
photo i took of the uh

453
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,839
the patch panel as i was assembling it

454
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,399
uh with the uh

455
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,519
this has a couple uh just two strand

456
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,440
cables are

457
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,519
two strand cables coming in up there at

458
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,360
the top that is actually a 24 string

459
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,920
cable coming in there on the bottom

460
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,839
uh so i have a number of strands from

461
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,439
the inside of my house out and duct all

462
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,199
the way to

463
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,360
out through the hand holes on my

464
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,959
property

465
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,720
so typical customer installation i

466
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,000
actually use these microtic media

467
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
converters

468
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,639
they're really inexpensive and work well

469
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,439
i use the uf instant with the olt

470
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,120
i use this enclosure on the outside of

471
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
the home from uh

472
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,600
uh total cable solutions go get some

473
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
armor some of the armored patch cords uh

474
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,959
john van open actually suggested these a

475
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,680
number of years ago to me

476
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,239
uh they're nice and durable uh you know

477
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
and you can

478
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,519
uh you know you can kind of abuse them

479
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,399
and they can go between

480
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,199
uh the the fiber nid and uh the media

481
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
converter

482
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
uh and then you run just regular cat5

483
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,880
poe from the inside to the outside

484
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,560
and if a customer wants a wireless

485
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,639
router i provide one for

486
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,920
for them at you know at cost so i don't

487
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,440
have to worry about any of the tax

488
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,279
implications of that

489
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,639
of like collecting sales tax and stuff

490
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
like that uh

491
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,160
so i don't need a sales tax license

492
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,440
which is uh important but

493
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,240
i i basically sell this at a

494
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,480
pass-through cost uh to them

495
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
so you continue to go out and get

496
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
supplies

497
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,399
so you know this is me loading up uh you

498
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,480
know

499
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,240
a prius with uh supplies you can see i

500
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,120
didn't even take my rock climbing gear

501
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,040
out of there

502
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,240
uh and stuff and you start digging holes

503
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,880
and you start putting this stuff in

504
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,199
ground

505
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,639
you know in the ground uh i'll tell you

506
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
it's really funny when you roll up in a

507
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,040
prius

508
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,319
uh at some of these places and you say

509
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,319
hey yeah i

510
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,360
i really want that uh you know that

511
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,079
concrete handle

512
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,839
tossed in the back here um it definitely

513
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,599
amuses them especially uh

514
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,440
i had a case where i needed to pick up a

515
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
new tread for uh

516
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,600
one of the pieces uh new tracks or tread

517
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,040
for one of the piece of equipment and

518
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,320
just throw yeah throw it in the back of

519
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,439
the prius it's you know it's fine

520
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
so yeah so um but you still need to

521
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,160
spend all this time

522
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,119
you know doing work collecting the

523
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,639
customers uh

524
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,160

washington county

527

like actually on paper i know in a

532
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,880
high-tech community like it doesn't make

533
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,839
sense

534
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,279
but you know i sent them letters in 2019

535
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,959
and i also sent them follow-up letters

536
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,560
in 2020 to all the people along the

537
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,239
route who didn't sign up

538
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,079
uh and went and tracked that and and

539
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
continued to send them letters and say

540
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,959
hey we're

541
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,399
we're still building service you're stu

542
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,599

private roads

546
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,040
that i passed and they had a road

547
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,240
association meeting and they said

going to look like and

552
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,040
and get to know them uh one of the

553
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,759
things that was a really

554
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,560
funny coincidence is uh one of the

555
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,519
people

556
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,959
people on that street has the same house

557
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,560
number as i do and we've actually been

558
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,079
getting each other's mail

559
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,280
uh for 10 years or so uh because the

560
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,319
letter carrier sometimes

561
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,199
uh hands us uh each other's mail

562
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,639
and funnily enough in in this this is a

563
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,880
small world thing

564
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
uh that person used to work at merit on

565
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,600
uh

566
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,839
long time ago and stuff and ultimately

567
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,719
of all these people who i end up

568
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,599
building and

569
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,559
uh you know going through and connecting

570
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,280
about 70

571
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
of the people i passed signed up which

572
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,120
actually was really

573
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,200
great so for

574
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,559
internet access you know you gotta you

575
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,039
gotta find that connection and

576
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,000
obviously there's nothing down by me uh

577
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,360
you know i had to go

578
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,080
build build up north uh where there was

579
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,120
some fiber

580
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,720
uh so i got a connection from acdnet uh

581
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,120
they're still in the process of enabling

582
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,480
ipv6 for me so i can go and have access

583
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,320
for that they actually

584
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,880
uh you know i'm nudging them to do that

585
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,918
so my consumers can have

586
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,679
v6 access and i can have v6 at home uh

587
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,360
you know one two three net is still

588
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,039
working on some uh

589
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,959
getting me connected i just got a

590
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,679
project update from them yesterday which

591
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,520
is great

592
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,960
uh and once i'm connected to one two

593
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,480
three net i'll actually be at the

594
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
detroit internet exchange and you can

595
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,520
peer with me there uh

596
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,799
and then you know the other important

597
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,600
stuff aaron you can apply for v6 space

598
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,360
uh and you know once you have v6 base

599
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,320
you can also apply for v6

600
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,799
or sorry you can apply for ipv4 space

601
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,799
and i

602
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,320
i had an old asn line around that i was

603
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,960
able to use for this project which was

604
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,360
nice

605
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,480
so i'm actually up with bgp and i'll be

606
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,719
multi-homed

607
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,200
you know here in short order at my house

608
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
so what does the project look like uh

609
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
you know

610
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,919
turned in the blueprint uh this entire

611
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,400
span like i said is about two miles

612
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,280
north

613
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,679
covering all the roads and uh uh paths

614
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
that

615
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,840
you need to do you've got you know

616
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,919
little waterways and uh you see

617
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,240
there's a green line for a natural gas

618
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,080
pipeline that had to be crossed as well

619
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,840
uh you know there's a lot of things you

620
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,799
drive by on a day-to-day basis that you

621
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,439
don't realize

622
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,120
are there uh and so if you slow down a

623
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,120
little bit you actually see all of these

624
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,559
little details which impact your project

625
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,120
can impact a project like this so

626
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,480
i had to also find contractors so and

627
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,199
have to have a good working relationship

628
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,360
with them which is

629
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,280
uh important i actually went i brought

630
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,199
brought them food out in the field

631
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,639
uh you know not every day but some of

632
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,320
the times i'd be like hey

633
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
you know you guys need some you need

634
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,399
some food it was nice it kept them

635
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,720
happy it kept them working uh you know

636
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,000
and uh it was important to be around

637
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,360
um you know it i i'm not

638
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,640
a fan of 2020 kovid aspect but

639
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,320
because of uh the kovitz situation

640
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,840
uh i was home a lot more this year

641
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,840
because business travel

642
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,039
obviously and i mean i'm presenting this

643
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,720
remotely

644
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,080
so a lot of people i'm sure understand

645
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,760
this you know

646
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,080
i was able to go out and resolve issues

647
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,160
along the uh you know along the way

648
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,080
i had to think about hey do i want to

649
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
create policies around social media

650
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,918
posts for my contractors

651
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,120
uh and get a good referral you know talk

652
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,559
to a few different people if you're

653
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
looking at doing a project like this

654
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,840
because

655
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,720
you know knowing uh the quality of work

656
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,199
and having them

657
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,320
uh do things uh you know it really makes

658
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,760
a difference

659
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,280
uh and then you know i helped make sure

660
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,960
they had all the right equipment so some

661
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,240
days you know they they forgot something

662
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
i either loaned them a piece of

663
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,120
equipment

664
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,360
uh you know or or helped them out and

665
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,799
and ran to the store and got something

666
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,879
uh in order to make sure everything was

667
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,559
smooth

668
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,640
uh so this is them when they're out

669
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,039
boring past the natural gas pipeline

670
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,400
uh you know this is it's 18 inch natural

671
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,840
gas pipeline so it's

672
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,039
you know relatively big important uh

673
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,799
services a lot of southeast michigan and

674
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,240
uh you know happens to run right through

675
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
the farm field behind my

676
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,520
my house uh and so here they are uh

677
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,719
you know making sure and uh that it's

678
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,039
there with uh

679
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,880
you know a nice hydrovac which is a tool

680
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,440
i'm hoping to

681
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,400
maybe one day have access to uh either

682
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,240
myself or have

683
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600
someone else i know have one so i can

684
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,520
borrow it when i need to go and

685
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,039
uh find things underground and then you

686
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,799
know there's the utility guy

687
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,120
uh watching and making sure that we

688
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,000
don't uh that actually my contractor

689
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,760
doesn't put a big hole

690
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,720
in this pipeline and create a big mess

691
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,360
so along the way you gotta expect

692
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,559
problems

693
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,199
we have this cursed corner um every time

694
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,520
we

695
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,720
uh we got it located they came back and

696
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,480
they put the paint in a different

697
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,600
location

698
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,679
you know it really made things uh

699
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,360
you know extremely difficult on top of

700
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,960
that you know

701
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,559
because there's existing utilities in

702
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,600
the way there's actually existing fiber

703
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,080
there

704
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,719
that we found out uh you know that

705
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,559
unfortunately

706
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,919
i wasn't able to get access to there's

707
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,280
existing fiber there there's

708
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,440
uh gas there's telephone uh

709
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,639
you know and then the the green lines

710
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,120
are

711
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,320
are my underground uh conduits uh you

712
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,600
know on this bottom left

713
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,480
here uh and you know very short distance

714
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,199
this distance took uh this span of 300

715
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,280
feet

716
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,919
uh took him three times to get because

717
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,399
each time something different went wrong

718
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,919
uh

719
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
you know and then after we finally

720
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,880
successfully got through it one of the

721
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,520
farmers actually stopped by and it's

722
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,120
like oh

723
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,639
yeah i know the guy who put in a lot of

724
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,439
the utilities of that corner

725
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,720
he said uh yeah anybody else who wants

726
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,400
to put something in there is gonna have

727
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,600
a real hard time

728
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,120
uh turns out absolutely true i had

729
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,719
had a real hard time there so

730
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,239
i managed to pick up some equipment

731
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
along the way as well

732
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,440
i picked up what i call you know my baby

733
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,760
drill it's a little uh jt820

734
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,960
i picked it up for just eight grand uh

735
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,158
and i also have a

736
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,400
cable plow that i uh you know

737
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,960
use to bury service drops it's actually

738
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,080
owned by the wireless isp that uh

739
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,200
uh i get act or i previously got access

740
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,439
from uh which you know was nice because

741
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,320
you know uh it's nice to be able to

742
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,919
share the equipment

743
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,840
and not have to go and spend money on

744
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,200
that myself uh

745
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,120
you know here's a picture of the drill

746
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
and then you know uh there we are

747
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
bearing uh

748
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,120
you know certain you know fiber service

749
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,559
drop uh you know a number of years ago

750
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,439
but like i said things go wrong

751
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,600
so what happens somebody went and uh

752
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,720
decided that they wanted to borrow

753
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,199
or take the uh take the machine

754
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,000
uh so the machine actually ended up for

755
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,960
sale on

756
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
uh on facebook uh which was interesting

757
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,760
in chicago

758
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,039
which is you know about a five to six

759
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
hour drive away

760
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,720
uh thankfully i had this photo here on

761
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,159
the left of in the spring when

762
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,960
i was trying to get the conduit out of

763
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,799
my yard and having a real hard time

764
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,640
uh and i took the photo to send to some

765
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,480
friends so they could laugh at me

766
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,760
but what was nice is that there were

767
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,720
some distinctive

768
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,360
uh marks on the machine here uh on the

769
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
left

770
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,158
that made it really easy to get the

771
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
police involved and actually get them to

772
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,120
reclaim this machine and

773
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,720
be able to go pick it back up so we're

774
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,080
actually able to recover it

775
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,840
uh you know and uh definitely

776
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,760
one of those you never know what's going

777
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,799
to happen uh

778
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,760
type of moment so anybody who's ever had

779
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,158
that happen

780
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,360
to them something goes disappearing yeah

781
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,480
definitely make sure you've got good

782
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,639
photos of it

783
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,559
and uh you know serial numbers and such

784
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,559
it's really important

785
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,240
so i also had other construction issues

786
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,678
actually received a stop work order in

787
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,679
the middle of the project

788
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,799
uh you know and so we went and worked

789
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,200
with uh

790
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,200
uh the local uh county road commission

791
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,080
uh in order to go and uh

792
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,039
you know resolve this uh their big

793
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,799
concerns were

794
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,720
that we didn't put enough stakes in the

795
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,720
right-of-way uh

796
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,400
you know and we weren't uh they have a

797
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,919
process whereby which you need to notify

798
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,080
them every time you're out there

799
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,200
working on it and my crew was working

800
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,360
three days a week

801
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,880
on the project and you know we notified

802
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,879
them when we started the project

803
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,360
but we weren't notifying them every

804
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
single week that they were coming back

805
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,399
and they want to be able to just drive

806
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,240
by and and know what's going on

807
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,679
so because of that i had unbudgeted

808
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,799
costs i had to spend an extra five

809
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,279
thousand dollars

810
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,720
to survey and stake the right away uh

811
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,640
also the conduit that was in the ground

812
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,200
we had to market and locate it

813
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,799
uh and stuff like that i actually got

814
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,600
employee badges printed up

815
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,080
uh for myself and for several other

816
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,959
people

817
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,799
just to cover uh stuff because during

818
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,279
the cove 19 time it was really hard to

819
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,600
tell

820
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,279
and uh you know what was exactly going

821
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,399
on especially in the spring when things

822
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,240
were changing quickly

823
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,760
uh and and like i said it had to get

824
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
water you've got to get water to run a

825
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,960
lot of this equipment

826
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,158
uh you know and so i had fifteen hundred

827
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,799
dollars in

828
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,760
for the deposit on the uh uh the fire

829
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,720
department hookup

830
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,200
on the uh uh you know for the fire

831
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,840
hydrant that was not planned

832
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,039
you know the other sorts of things yeah

833
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,720
unmarked utilities

834
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,720
it's basically always the case that

835
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,400
something happens

836
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,080
you're going to find something and

837
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,720
somebody's not going to market right

838
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,639
actually just yesterday i called the

839
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
local gas utility i was out getting

840
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
ready to do something

841
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,400
and they marked the gas main it's a i

842
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,520
think it's a two or three inch gas main

843
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
uh it was marked off by 12 feet uh from

844
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,840
where it should

845
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,919
you know where they should have marked

846
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,279
it uh and so it's really

847
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,559
important i've learned you know you

848
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,679
always want to go out and double check

849
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,960
all those marks and have your own

850
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,080
locating equipment

851
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,960
uh you know for this and so just some of

852
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,240
the things that

853
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,880
happen along the way it's uh you know

854
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,799
i know on nano we often see you know oh

855
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
somebody hit this fiber or something

856
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,520
uh quite often you know people don't

857
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,639
have records of it or it's just

858
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,200
you know people don't don't hook up to

859
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,880
all of them

860
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,840
uh just like i said at that cursed

861
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,520
corner never got located twice

862
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,039
so after all this you start getting out

863
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,639
there you do fiber insulation you can

864
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,919
see the lovely cornfield

865
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,919
and i'll tell you something it felt

866
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,240
really great in some ways

867
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,400
uh you know this reel of fiber this is

868
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,039
the last of a twenty thousand foot

869
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,159
uh reel of fiber uh that we're laying

870
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,440
out that's uh

871
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,880
you know being buried here uh and you

872
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,240
know when once you realize you've used

873
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,799
20 000 feet of fiber

874
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,799
that is really really uh amazing

875
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,240
i ended up building my own fiber blower

876
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,399
as part of this project

877
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
it actually worked out really well uh

878
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,039
went 2 700 feet

879
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,200
you know without an issue in doing this

880
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,120
it helped to have the right

881
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,120
right equipment installed

882
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,480
and then you got to get out there and do

883
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,279
all the fiber splicing

884
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,559
uh and so it's out there uh literally

885
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,880
sitting on the side of the road

886
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,960
splicing everything together uh making

887
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,799
it happen

888
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,240
along the way you got what do you do

889
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,760
after you splice you go you check the

890
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,360
otdr trace

891
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,720
uh as you can tell this is not a good

892
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,199
otg trace it has

893
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,080
quite a lot of loss on the short path uh

894
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,039
and so go back

895
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,158
and clean up the splices uh you know and

896
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,320
after you do that

897
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,440
yeah it looks a little bit better it's

898
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
still not great but

899
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,039
definitely uh definitely enough that

900
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,918
it's uh no longer an issue

901
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,320
i also need to upgrade my otdr uh you

902
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,279
know

903
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,158
this one's great for testing on uh you

904
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,679
know on uh

905
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,960
fiber that doesn't have any service on

906
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,000
it but once you have service on it you

907
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,039
really need uh

908
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,919
i really need a different otdr than this

909
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,760
so i happen to know what i'm doing i've

910
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,600
been in this industry a few times

911
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,360
i was talking with a member of the pc

912
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,959
the other day i said yeah i've been

913
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,039
i've been coming in analog since now

914
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,399
gate so

915
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,158
you know you get your scheduled service

916
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,678
installed everything's going to be great

917
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,000
right well

918
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,840
had all sorts of things happen so the

919
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,640
tech had to visit the co

920
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,918
install an optic he he was like hey yeah

921
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,679
channel 44 optic

922
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,840
put it in the dwdm system uh guess what

923
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,240
you know he he put in the only system

924
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,399
that had channel 44 available

925
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,440
wrong system uh the existing system had

926
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,479
a one gig optic

927
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,080
left in it uh plus a 10 db attenuator

928
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,520
uh you know that when they originally

929
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,840
did the splicing where they were meeting

930
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,200
me

931
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,639
uh you know they they tested back and so

932
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,799
uh that was that was interesting so

933
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,720
tech comes to my house delivers 10 gig

934
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,720
optic i plug it into my router i'm like

935
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,360
hey

936
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,000
i see i see light that's great well

937
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,600
turns out he gave me a 10 gig lr

938
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
there really needed to be something else

939
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,158
also uh

940
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,200
the the isp wanted to give me a cpe for

941
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,919
on-site

942
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
uh want to give me a 6500. i politely

943
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,200
declined and said

944
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,880
yeah i'd really rather uh you know can i

945
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,480
please plug the optic into my own

946
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,679
equipment or can you use some

947
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,120
you know something smaller than a 6504

948
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,720
so what i do i hop in the car uh i drive

949
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,279
to the isp headquarter

950
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,000
uh go and meet the guy on a friday night

951
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,399
uh

952
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,399
giving back his uh 10 gig lr i get a one

953
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,080
gig 80 kilometer optic

954
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,840
i visited a friend up in lansing at the

955
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,918
headquarters uh

956
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,080
and drove home plugged in the optic and

957
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,919
then the most important thing

958
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,439
i get a syslog message saying hey my

959
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,720
link is up

960
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,840
and this is great so before

961
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,919
what is what's my latency to you know

962
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,240
to machine and 350 cermax look like it's

963
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,720
about 30 milliseconds or so

964
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,480
afterwards i'm down to you know about

965
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,000
eight eight and a half seconds

966
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,559
you know really a significant

967
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,399
improvement

968
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,918
not only in latency you know you start

969
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,520
doing trace routes and you say hey you

970
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,360
can see all the intermediate cities like

971
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,080
jackson and lansing

972
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,199
uh and stuff and uh go and reach the

973
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,799
machines in chicago

974
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,559
you gotta get have graphs so you know

975
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,240
i've got smoke ping here showing me you

976
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,320
know hey my latency went down

977
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,000
so that was great uh you know i waited a

978
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,279
couple hours i went to bed

979
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,640
and i woke up in the middle of the night

980
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,720
i'm like i'm just going to do it i'm

981
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,840
going to cut it over

982
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,120
and do stuff because yeah you know i was

983
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,840
expecting a 10 gig

984
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,399
it's a one gig i didn't have bgp you

985
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,639
know

986
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,439
got to go to the next plan down the list

987
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,480
i i grabbed the edge router x sfp

988
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,799
uh plugged it in it can do nat uh you

989
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,880
know

990
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,918
and so i actually natted to the wan ip

991
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,279
address

992
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,880
uh and then the most important thing

993
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,840
that you do besides looking at the

994
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,279
you know the pings here's a slide to

995
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,519
make tempkin happy

996
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,000
you know going and showing you know hey

997
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,880
uh netflix still runs uh

998
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
you know fast.com i go i look i say hey

999
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,480
this is great considering

1000
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,159
you know you cut off a couple zeros and

1001
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,159
that's what i was getting at uh

1002
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,360
most recently this is a significant

1003
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,000
improvement

1004
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,120
so remember i got my neighbors pre-wired

1005
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,120
for fiber

1006
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,639
so i removed all the rate limiters i

1007
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,840
sent them a text message

1008
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,519
you know once it was an appropriate hour

1009
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,760
uh and best response yowza you know

1010
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,000
it took me a couple more days i we got

1011
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,960
the optic swap to 10 gig they pulled out

1012
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,720
the attenuator

1013
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:06,240
we got bgp up with the right config

1014
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,120
and stuff so now since then i've been

1015
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,080
running around

1016
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,959
like crazy working seven days a week uh

1017
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,840
you know i've been

1018
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,399
getting customers pre-wired since the

1019
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,080
spring uh but

1020
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,080
i you know because of all the unmarked

1021
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,000
utilities and people were upset that i

1022
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,279
kept cutting their att lines which were

1023
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
not well marked

1024
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,960
uh you know i i kind of paused doing

1025
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,519
that in the spring

1026
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,080
but you know got as many people

1027
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,399
connected

1028
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,840
i'm still out there doing uh you know

1029
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,840
doing things with the exception of a

1030
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,399
brief pause in early september because

1031
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,918
uh

1032
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,439
you know a family member had some

1033
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,080
medical needs uh

1034
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,559
you know yeah and install takes me about

1035
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,559
two to four hours to do uh and if

1036
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,158
everything's pre-wired you know it might

1037
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,760
take me less than an hour it's basically

1038
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,200
just running cat5 in and out of the

1039
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,679
house you know

1040
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,960
making sure all that looks real good but

1041
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,360
i'll tell you there's a lot of small

1042
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,399
dependencies i encounter along the way

1043
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,199
and those definitely take time

1044
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,639
what it cost i'll tell you 2020 had a

1045
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,760
lot of my costs

1046
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,840
uh you know of of 126 000

1047
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,200
i spent about 95 000 went to the

1048
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
directional drilling company

1049
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,320
i had miscellaneous materials i had that

1050
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,840
surveying uh

1051
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,439
it took me a couple tries with the air

1052
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,918
compressor to kind of get a good system

1053
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,200
going

1054
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,600
so i ended up uh giving things

1055
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,120
you know renting it a couple times you

1056
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
know in order to get out of the stop

1057
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,600
work order

1058
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,440
as well as to get some of the cable

1059
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,279
installed uh you know

1060
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,559
and i don't know maybe maybe this is

1061
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,720
still cheaper

1062
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,240
than moving but i don't know i've got

1063
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,960
fiber

1064
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,080
so current customer status i've got 23

1065
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,240
customers online

1066
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,158
including my house i've got my business

1067
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,159
customer the existing wireless isp

1068
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,840
actually is buying access from me now

1069
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,080
i have 13 people i still need to get

1070
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,439
installed i've got two more prospects

1071
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,000
that i think i'm going to be able to get

1072
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,399
hooked up

1073
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
uh as well with uh you know a little bit

1074
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,959
of effort one of them i've got to cross

1075
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,640
across

1076
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,120
cross and connect to their like they've

1077
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,240
got about 160 acre campus

1078
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,760
uh actually and get them service so need

1079
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,000
to get across that

1080
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,679
uh i still also have two people who are

1081
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
currently still hanging off my house on

1082
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,520
wireless

1083
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,839
uh that were not pre-installed on fiber

1084
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,480
uh

1085
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,839
and so that still needs to get done uh

1086
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,399
you know and i'm trying you know i've

1087
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,078
tried to be

1088
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,359
relatively fair with people i say hey

1089
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,320
you know i'm installing you in the order

1090
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,000
which you signed up

1091
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,919
modulo some of the dependencies so if

1092
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,199
you're really far out i may not be able

1093
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,560
to get to you if there's

1094
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,078
you know some other little piece that

1095
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,199
needs to be built first

1096
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,079
you know also network usage a lot of

1097
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,598
people are

1098
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,440
are worried about hey what does it look

1099
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,960
like when you connect people to fiber

1100
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,639
uh the majority of the people are

1101
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,359
actually not rate limited right now

1102
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,919
uh still to this day uh so they have

1103
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,719
they

1104
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,239
they basically have a gig at home uh you

1105
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,000
know the big spikes actually on the

1106
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,560
craft tend to actually be my house

1107
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,079
and my kids downloading some new game uh

1108
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,639
usually on the weekends uh when they

1109
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,960
have it

1110
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,320
but you know the even with all that the

1111
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,480
network usage

1112
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,160
uh is less than you know is less than

1113
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,480
five megabits a subscriber

1114
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,240
especially on the p95 basis so

1115
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,520
i have way too many people to thank for

1116

hi welcome back to nanog80 and with me i

1171
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,640
have jared mock from akaway

1172
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,720
and you just saw his presentation uh we

1173
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,440
have a couple questions that were posted

1174
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,118
to the

1175
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,200
q a forum so jared you had that

1176
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,359
messed up on your machine didn't you uh

1177
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,839
i do have i do have them pulled up

1178
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,560
so uh i can i can just answer the ones

1179
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,240
uh

1180
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,799
you know that i've seen in there so from

1181
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,000
ian uh you know he asks uh what happens

1182
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,839
if i try to move

1183
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,119
uh and all the stuff is in my basement

1184
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,240
uh so actually when

1185
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,440
i constructed uh and designed how the

1186
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,359
fiber would come into

1187
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,960
my street and on my house we actually

1188
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,720
put an extra service loop

1189
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,160
where the conduit goes down the road and

1190
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,598
then back um

1191
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,920
right by where one of the electrical

1192
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,800
transformers is uh that's actually in my

1193
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,720
property

1194
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,839
uh and so if i was to move or something

1195
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,319
i can actually uh

1196
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,200
grant myself an easement before i move

1197
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,560
uh you know on my way out of uh

1198
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,319
out of the neighborhood and go and move

1199
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,119
the equipment there relatively easily by

1200
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,240
just

1201
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,280
moving the splice point um

1202
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,240
as as far as uh you know so uh i dare

1203
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,440
asked uh whether or not i what i have

1204
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,879
for a kind of backup

1205
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,079
uh you know if i'm traveling or

1206
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,599
something because many of you have seen

1207
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,119
me around the world traveling

1208
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,720
uh you know at nanohog and the other

1209
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,640
conferences uh

1210
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,520
the existing wireless isp uh

1211
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,520
he and i have really you know i very

1212
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,480
carefully tried to not be in a business

1213
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,400
partnership with him

1214
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,480
but we've really helped each other out

1215
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,320
uh you know the way you would get mutual

1216
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,040
aid from a lot of other people you know

1217
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,440
i'm sure

1218
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,599
many people who have either friend colo

1219
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,640
or have had friends go into their data

1220
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,200
center space and

1221
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,078
you know power cycle things for them uh

1222
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,439
and so we we

1223
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,200
really have a good working relationship

1224
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,960
so when he's out of town you know i go

1225
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,279
over i can check on some of his wireless

1226
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,280
equipment for him if customers complain

1227
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,880
uh and you know we kind of have a you

1228
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,440
know a mutual handshake agreement on

1229
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,680
that

1230
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,920
but i did budget for that actually uh

1231
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,200
you know for paying him or somebody else

1232
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,720
uh to account for those uh you know for

1233
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,359
those types of expenses

1234
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,560
uh ramon wu asked how many customers i

1235
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,960
have signed up

1236
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,560
uh you know so i you know that's covered

1237
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,480
in one of the slides so i've got i think

1238
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,720
23 people up right now

1239
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,640
uh and a couple you know another about

1240
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,279
15 to 20 or so that i'm in the process

1241
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,118
of doing

1242
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,720
and and i'm actively making plans for

1243
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,280
how i'm going to expand

1244
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,040
uh this so i'm i'm in active discussions

1245
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,160
with a number of contractors and

1246
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,599
people who are in some other

1247
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,879
high-density neighborhoods who've seen

1248
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,040
what i've done and

1249
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,920
want want me to bring services in there

1250
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,839
because

1251
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,160
either they've got limited dsl speeds or

1252
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,960
no dsl available in their area

1253
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,680
blake actually asked a very interesting

1254
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,079
question

1255
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,359
uh blake willis about contractors social

1256
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,760
media policy

1257
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,560
i i wanted to just comment on that

1258
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,320
because

1259
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,240
i think many of us are used to taking

1260
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,880
pictures of of different things

1261
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,640
or posting about our experiences during

1262
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,200
the stop work order one of the

1263
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,078
uh one of the uh people who worked for

1264
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,598
my directional boring contractor

1265
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,920
they posted uh a rant about

1266
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,119
the uh stop work order and and how that

1267
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,960
all went down

1268
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,160
uh and that actually caught the

1269
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,560
attention of the

1270
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,078
local uh uh road commission people who

1271
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,640
are the ones who had to pull the permits

1272
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,680
through

1273
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:13,200
uh and so you wanna be mindful of what

1274
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,759
of how uh

1275
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,919
how people who are in your employ either

1276
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,040
directly or indirectly as part of that

1277
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,640
may post on social media about uh the

1278
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,119
work that they're doing for you

1279
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,000
so uh you know in the event that they

1280
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,920
might post a po

1281
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,520
photo of themselves on private property

1282
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,440
or something

1283
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,040
um i'm i'm told we've got about a minute

1284
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,720
or two left here

1285
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,079
um you know so

1286
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,000
uh there's a question about the

1287
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,960
right-of-way to the right-of-way i

1288
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,960
permitted that all

1289
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,319
uh the reason the reason why i started a

1290
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,520
telephone company

1291
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,880
is because it's easier to actually gain

1292
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,800
access to the right-of-way

1293
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,160
uh by being on listed utility in the

1294
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,920
state of michigan

1295
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,520
from the local permitting agency so that

1296
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,880
that is actually the main reason why i

1297
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,560
did that and since it was only a

1298
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,160
thousand dollars to file

1299
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,640
the tariff it actually is a relatively

1300
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,000
modest cost considered the

1301
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,920
considering the cost of the entire

1302
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,920
project um

1303
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:20,720
i don't know dave or i'm sorry michael

1304
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,240
what other questions you want to do one

1305
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,560
more that would be great and then we can

1306
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,799
go right into our next presentation

1307
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,480
yes so there's at least two different

1308
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,599
questions kind of about utility marking

1309
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,680
and location

1310
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,640
uh so the way it works in michigan and

1311
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,759
this really varies state by state

1312
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,759
so the way it works in michigan is uh

1313
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,839
you join to be a member of something you

1314
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,040
know of the misdig organization

1315
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,520
uh i then get notified

1316
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,800
you can have a contractor who you pay to

1317
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,920
get notified for example

1318
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,599
some people use urg or usic you know who

1319
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,359
are contractors who go out and mark for

1320
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,040
you know for comcast at t

1321
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,240
or our local electric and water people

1322
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,839
but realistically it's up to you to make

1323
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,879
sure that it gets marked and gets marked

1324
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,680
correctly

1325
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,160
uh and that they get uh notified and so

1326
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,560
if

1327
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,399
you're within if you hit a utility

1328
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,078
that's within 48 inches of where they

1329
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,880
put paint or flags

1330
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,319
uh and they marked it correctly uh

1331
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,040
you're liable if they didn't market

1332
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,079
correctly

1333
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,480
the utility is liable uh in the case of

1334
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,119
that uh that's at least the way it works

1335
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,160
in michigan

1336
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,079
state law um and there's a

1337
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,160
there's a number of you know additional

1338
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,240
things that kind of come with that about

1339
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,000
uh what needs to happen so in the case

1340
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,399
of the pipeline where i showed the photo

1341
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,880
of

1342
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,520
us uh of the contractor boring past the

1343
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,920
pipeline

1344
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,599
they required the utility representative

1345
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,000
to be on site for that which is why i

1346
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,079
have that

1347
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,040
photo of us standing out there over the

1348
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,680
pipeline

1349
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,119
uh you know and and he's there basically

1350
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,640
saying like nope you know you got to be

1351
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,720
very careful because

1352
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,879
uh you know i think that's roughly the

1353
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,200
same size of a pipeline that uh

1354
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,560
uh you know was damaged number of years

1355
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,879
ago in the bay area to

1356
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,240

1361
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,840
