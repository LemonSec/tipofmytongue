hi

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,679
i'm cecila testert and in this

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
presentation i'll be showing you our

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,120
work

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,639
in finding and profiling pgp hijackers

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,640
this is a work done in collaboration

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,279
with philip richter and david clarke at

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,039
mit

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,720
and aleister king and alberto denoti

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,480
from cada uc san diego

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,919
and this was originally presented at the

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,000
acm imc conference last year

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
so our motivation for this work is the

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
fact that bgp hijacking is pervasive in

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,920
the internet

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
as you can see here in these headlines

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
some of these

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,840
very known hijacks are from a long time

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,879
ago so this one that i'm showing

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,520
is from 2008 but the other ones

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
are much more recent from just last year

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
or even

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,000
earlier this year so even though it's

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
known for a long time

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,800
bgp hijacking is still a problem that is

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,038
far from solved

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,078
and in trying to find evidence of this

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,800
hijack i

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
realized that sometimes operators

31
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,518
disclose these hijacks

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,680
in males sent to nanak and

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,040
going through the mails in nanak and

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,119
noting the perpetrators of this hijack

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
we found that there are networks that

36
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,040
repeatedly hijack

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
over different periods of time and we

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,799
start calling this network

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,600
serial hijackers so these are networks

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,360
that hijack

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,679
a prefix at some point and then a few

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,720
times later there's another um

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,280
evidence of some other prefix and let me

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,000
tell you

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,520
the story of one of this quintessential

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,200
hijacker that i call

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,600
which is bit canal so this network

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,439
there's evidence of its hijacks that

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,320
comes to light for the first time in a

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,758
blog post in september 2014

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,079
and it keeps being connected to the

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,560
network then again there's another blog

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,199
post

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,560
with some evidence other hijacks that

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,520
come to light in january 2015.

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
and then uh three years later there's a

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,560
lengthy email going on

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,640
in nanak uh where the author is calling

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
to the transit provider to disconnect

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,199
this network because of the

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,160
large evidence of repeated misbehavior

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,519
of this network

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,440
and this network ends up being

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,800
disconnected uh in july 2018.

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,720
so it took four years for this network

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
to be disconnected for deceiving

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,440
hijacker to be disconnected

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,000
and i was inspired by this and i'd like

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,400
my research to help to improve that

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,400
so to do so the research goals of this

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
work was to find several hijackers in

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,840
the internet

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,200
and identify their distinctive routing

74
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
characteristic

75
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,280
then use them to build a machine

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,200
learning model that would allow us to

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,040
look at the behavior of more networks in

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,839
the internet and flag the suspicions

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
ones

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,920
evaluate the results of our classifier

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,959
and finally see what we can learn from

82
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,518
the serial hijackers

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,319
so the first step in doing this is to

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,200
find a ground truth for serial hijackers

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,560
so going through many emails for about

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,640
five years on the nano

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
mailing list i ended up finding three

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,119
networks that

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,519
i call serial hijackers these networks

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,560
uh look starting from the evidence of

91
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
the

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
of the emails i'm able to find at least

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,599
10 prefixes that

94
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,400
they have hijacked at different points

95
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,399
in time most of these network

96
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
have been acting for over a year when

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,799
looking at their bgp data

98
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
and also looking at their overall

99
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,760
activity in bgp

100
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,238
i found that some of them have

101
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,120
originated up to 30 000 different

102
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,519
prefixes

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,599
in the five years window of our um

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,120
experiment

105
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,760
and here on the right you can see the

106
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,360
map uh where the black dots

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,959
represent the countries from these

108
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,879
networks and you can see that they're

109
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,360
distributed more or less all over the

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,518
world there's not a one country that has

111
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,599
a larger concentration of them there's

112
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,879
some of them in europe in the us

113
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,720
in asia and in africa then

114
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,079
to keep on building these ground truths

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
i need the legitimate

116
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
networks and for that i based my

117
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,799
selection on the networks that agreed to

118
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,640
be part of these

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
mutually agreed norms for routing

120
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,319
security manners

121
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,518
so because this network voluntarily

122
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,359
agreed in

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,040
increasing their or adopting certain

124
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,880
routing behavior that would improve

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,440
security i

126
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,320
um we interpret that as they wouldn't be

127
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,639
persistently

128
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,680
misbehaving and that's why we include

129
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,320
them as legitimate networks

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,919
at the point of the study there were 191

131
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,040
networks that were part of this

132
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,000
agreement

133
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,560
and we augmented them with 26 minor

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
selected

135
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,759
yeses just to add more diversity to the

136
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,600
set of

137
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,320
networks and autonomous system that we

138
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,000
were studying

139
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,240
so with that ground truth then

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,919
we need to come up with the btp data for

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,880
those networks and for that

142
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,599
we use the publicly available collectors

143
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,919
so we use

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,880
all libraries and route views collector

145
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,479
these are over

146
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,199
40 collectors and there's over 1400

147
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,120
networks that provide bgp information to

148
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,919
these collectors

149
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
for the time window of our measurement

150
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,120
we process

151
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,039
all the bgp updates that are sent by the

152
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,919
different networks to these collectors

153
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,360
to reconstruct the routing tables of

154
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,840
these networks

155
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,759
from those routing tables we extract the

156
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,198
prefix and origin

157
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,479
aes in the bgp

158
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,800
in the pdb path and then

159
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,880
we count how many peers have a given

160
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
prefix and origin is in the routing

161
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,880
table

162
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,520
and that gives us the visibility of each

163
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,039
prefix

164
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,840
on as pair and we do this from january

165
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,479
2014

166
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,320
until the end of december 2018 so it's a

167
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,520
five-year window

168
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,719
so at the end we end up with

169
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,440
um we end up with a database

170
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,280
that has prefix the origin as the

171
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,479
visibility in surface the number of

172
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,719
prefixes that have that

173
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,919
given prefix is in the routing table and

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
a time stamp

175
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,080
from when we computed these and this is

176
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,599
every five minutes

177
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,080
so with this very large data set of uh

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
all these vdp information going on in

179
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,639
bdp

180
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,198
a first step was to try to understand

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,080
the behavior of networks in our data set

182
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,560
and for that

183
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
we used a graphical representation that

184
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,479
allows us to

185
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,639
better understand the behaviors network

186
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,080
so here for example

187
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,280
is a graphical representation of an es

188
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,240
of british telecom

189
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,880
so this is a network in the uk and here

190
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,759
you can see on the x axis are the dates

191
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,120
of our measurement and on the y-axis

192
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,960
each line represents

193
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,759
a different prefix that has been

194
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,520
originated in bgp by this network

195
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,960
so the green lines that you see crossing

196
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,280
from one side to the other

197
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,239
of the graph are actually prefixes that

198
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,280
this network

199
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,560
has been originating all the time and in

200
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,479
every five-minute

201
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,120
snapshot we're able to see that prefix

202
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,560
being originated by this network

203
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,400
and of course you can see that some of

204
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,479
these prefix are um

205
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,318
start to be advertised in the middle of

206
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,000
the graph some of these prefix stop

207
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,240
being advertised

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
and this is usual behavior that we would

209
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
expect in

210
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,719
network operators and also you can see

211
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,160
that there's a column

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,960
in red and it is in red because those

213
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,840
are prefix

214
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,440
that uh reach a very low level of

215
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,679
visibility in our data set

216
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,479
less than 15 and that's why we graph

217
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
them in red

218
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,080
and also you can see that this happened

219
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,680
for a very short period of time

220
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,000
so although most of um of these graphs

221
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,599
show a very stable behavior there can be

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,280
routing events that look a little bit

223
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,840
different

224
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,638
so overall this is a very stable

225
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,679
behavior

226
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,199
and in comparison this is the same

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,039
using the same representation this is

228
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,319
what the serial hijackers looks in this

229
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,960
representation

230
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,680
so here you can see there's a large

231
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,758
difference

232
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,599
mainly the amount of white that is in

233
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,680
these uh representation

234
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,680
and that means that most of the prefixes

235
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
that are originated by djs

236
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,759
originated by a very short period of

237
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,120
time in our data set

238
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,960
and also you can see a huge contrast in

239
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,520
the number of different prefixes

240
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,080
so this network originates over about

241
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,840
1500

242
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
different prefixes in this five-year

243
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,520
data set whereas british telecom

244
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,120
only originates about 200.

245
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,319
so the syrian high dagger bgp activity

246
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,440
looks very different

247
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,320
from the legitimate one

248
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,880
and now we need to um derive features

249
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,240
that are

250
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,000
going to allow us to capture this

251
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,600
difference in behavior

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,360
and from this example it might seem that

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,959
it's very easy but of course there's

254
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,600
variability in the behavior of

255
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,160
legitimate yeses and several hijackers

256
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
so here you can see some other serial

257
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,800
hijackers

258
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,040
what how they look like in this

259
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,279
graphical representation

260
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,040
and here you can see other benign

261
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,839
networks and what they look like in this

262
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
representation

263
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,560
so our uh these different graphs were

264
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,000
our inspiration

265
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,279
to come up with hypotheses of how

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,959
a serial hijacker would

267
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,120
how the behavior of a serial hijacker

268
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,640
would look like in our data set compared

269
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,120
to a benign network and we

270
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
one thing is that sierra hijackers would

271
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,959
tend to have repeated absence from the

272
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,959
global routing table

273
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,479
because they um sometimes they're

274
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,199
originally prefixed sometimes they're

275
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,279
not there

276
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,959
whereas most benign networks once they

277
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,880
start originating prefixes

278
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,119
they keep on originating prefixes for a

279
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,760
very long time

280
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,440
then um stereo hijackers when looking at

281
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,959
the specific prefixes

282
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
they're trying to have shorter

283
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,560
origination times

284
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,920
whereas again in legitimate networks

285
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,000
usually they're

286
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,199
um once they start reaching their prefix

287
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
is relatively stable

288
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,920
then uh we looked at the conflicts that

289
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,000
the prefixes originated with by this

290
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,120
network could have with other networks

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,360
in the internet

292
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,120
and our hypothesis was that they would

293
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
have more conflict with legitimate

294
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
networks

295
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,519
although we acknowledged that there are

296
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,519
legitimate reasons why this might happen

297
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,839
and then again uh we believe that

298
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,839
the syria um street hijackers would have

299
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
much more volatility in the count of

300
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,480
prefixes that are being originated over

301
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,120
time

302
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,240
compared to benign networks and for

303
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,640
example

304
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
here is a graph that looks at the number

305
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,000
of prefix being

306
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,199
originated by a given network in five

307
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
minutes bucket

308
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,360
and on the left side you can see comcast

309
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,440
and you can see that is mostly

310
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,399
stable except for a huge peak that

311
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
lasted

312
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,079
about a day and then it goes back to a

313
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,760
relatively stable level

314
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,519
and we reach out to them and it turns

315
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,920
out that at the moment that had a

316
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,560
an infrastructure problem which made

317
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,279
them

318
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,920
de-aggregate most of their prefixes and

319
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,680
that

320
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,519
hugely increased the number of prefixes

321
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,560
that they originated at the

322
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,240
during that time in contrast

323
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,079
for the serial hijacker you can see that

324
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,120
this number goes up and down

325
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,959
and many times is go this line goes down

326
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,640
to zero which means that at that point

327
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,959
they disappear from the global routing

328
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,839
table

329
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,079
and another difference uh between steer

330
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,000
hijackers and benign networks

331
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,079
is the fact that the ip.use have a

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,519
broader geographical distribution

333
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,959
so ip blocks are distributed by the five

334
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,079
rirs and most networks have

335
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,239
their ip resources from one riyar or

336
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,160
from a few of them but most of the

337
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,800
resources are concentrated in one of

338
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,800
them

339
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,359
given the geographical zone where

340
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,599
they're operating

341
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,440
however given that serial hijackers do

342
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
not go through the delegation process

343
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,240
that other neighbors go

344
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,279
they can use just any uh ip

345
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,279
prefixes and their distribution

346
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,360
tends to be more equal between the our

347
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,240
years and not be so concentrated

348
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,720
so to measure this we use the guinea

349
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,720
index which is heavily used in economics

350
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,839
to measure the inequality of wealth

351
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,079
distribution

352
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,040
and here we measure the inequality of

353
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,079
distribution of

354
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:29,439
our of ips per rr so a guinea of 0.8

355
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,680
means that all all ip resources from our

356
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,000
network are concentrated in one rir

357
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,760
and in this graph we can see that serial

358
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,800
hijackers the orange line

359
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,279
tend to have lower guiness which means

360
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,479
that their distribution is more uniform

361
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:48,160
between all five rirs

362
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,720
so in our data we found confirmation

363
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,719
of this different behavior in this five

364
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,240
point between several hijackers

365
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,200
and uh benign networks and then

366
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,000
we derive 52 different features that

367
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,639
capture

368
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,279
the different behaviors and the um and

369
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,279
the different flavors of this difference

370
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,040
between serial hijackers and legitimate

371
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,279
ess

372
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,959
and then using that we build a machine

373
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,000
learning system

374
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,599
to then run it with other networks

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,519
but there are challenges in applying

376
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
machine learning uh to find

377
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,160
more potential serial hijackers the

378
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,880
first challenge that we

379
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,800
we get is that our data is actually

380
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,040
really heavy-tailed and skewed

381
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,160
and by that what i mean is that in most

382
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,480
of our dimensions

383
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,279
when looking at aess these networks

384
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,839
they're

385
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,279
most of them concentrated in just one

386
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,040
part of our dimension

387
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,480
but then there's the long tail that

388
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,199
really extend the size

389
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,120
of our variables and then we have

390
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,399
variables that are very different

391
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,160
in size so for example um one variable

392
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,560
could be the number of prefixes that

393
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,319
they're

394
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,239
originating in a certain period of time

395
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,399
and it could go to a few thousand

396
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,000
but we also have the guinea index which

397
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,079
just varies between 0 and 0.8

398
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,519
and these difference make it very

399
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,638
difficult to normalize

400
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,120
our data then again

401
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
we have a very small ground truth

402
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
because

403
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,639
building the ground truth at the end we

404
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,480
end up just with 240 networks

405
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,279
when there's over 70 000 networks in the

406
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
internet

407
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,519
and of those network about 20 000 of

408
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
them originate more than 10 prefixes

409
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,199
and lastly we have a huge class

410
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,440
imbalance

411
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,959
because we were able to find only 23

412
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
different serial hijackers

413
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,880
and we have over 200 legitimate networks

414
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,160
and we need to be to carefully train our

415
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,199
classifier

416
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,719
uh because of this class in balance

417
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,760
so our approach to solve this is to use

418
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,560
a tree based classifier that is able to

419
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,720
handle

420
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,000
all these variables with very different

421
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,320
dimensions

422
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,320
and we also use a voting ensemble of

423
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,600
extremely randomized forest

424
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,800
because that allows us to train every

425
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,720
different uh forest with a different

426
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,160
base um a different breeze

427
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,760
that comes from different sampling

428
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,079
techniques and that way

429
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,880
because each sampling techniques create

430
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,560
uh the

431
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,120
synthetic data points a little bit

432
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,599
different we're able to gather uh

433
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,079
to have a better trained classifier

434
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,040
using this technique

435
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,519
and finally for the 52 features that we

436
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,240
built

437
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,079
we wonder if we could have uh select a

438
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,639
few of them that are more relevant than

439
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,439
others

440
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,920
but it turns out that looking at the

441
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,759
looking at the accuracy of our model uh

442
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
every time we took one of the features

443
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,399
out it was less accurate so we ended up

444
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,480
having

445
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,079
all 52 features because they all had a

446
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,519
positive median drop columns

447
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,079
importance so at the end using this

448
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,800
approach

449
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,319
a classifier ends up having uh almost

450
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,519
eighty percent position and hundred

451
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,759
percent recall

452
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,720
and what this means is that our

453
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,880
classifier

454
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,800
is able to select all the serial

455
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
hijackers from our ground truth

456
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,599
but it always includes a few legitimate

457
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,320
networks in that set

458
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,800
so knowing this limitation we went and

459
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
run this classifier in all the data from

460
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,199
the networks that we

461
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:26,240
um got from from the bgp collectors

462
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,079
so with the goal of finding uh networks

463
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,880
with similar behavior to the serial

464
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,519
hijackers we start with the 75 000

465
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,000
networks that we find on our data set

466
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,040
of these only about a little bit less

467
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,120
than 20 000

468
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,880
originate at least 10 prefixes in the

469
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,600
five years of our data set

470
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,480
and we only run in the data from these

471
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,160
networks

472
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,000
given that if we're looking at silver

473
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,040
hijacker we'd expect them to have

474
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,880
originated

475
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,639
at least 10 prefixes in five years

476
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,320
our classifier flags a little bit over

477
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,880
900 networks

478
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,680
from this set and this means that it's a

479
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,240
little bit less

480
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,319
of five percent of all the aess seemed

481
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,599
to originate over 10 prefixes in those

482
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,079
five years of time

483
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,240
and it's about 1.2 percent of all the

484
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,480
ess that we see in these five years data

485
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,480
set

486
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,079
so with this result we wanted to learn

487
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,760
who were these networks and the first

488
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,280
approach was to look at

489
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,119
their behavior in the same graphical

490
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,240
representation i showed you before and

491
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,799
these are

492
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,760
the representations from networks that

493
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,160
were flagged by a classifier

494
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,919
and we can see that uh they're very

495
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,280
similar to the ones that

496
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,880
we saw earlier and then

497
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,320
studying a little bit more what are this

498
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,960
network well

499
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,360
we started first by looking if we could

500
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
find

501
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,120
any indication of malicious behavior in

502
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
these networks

503
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,199
and the first place that we want to look

504
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,520
at this were block lists

505
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,120
so we look at the block list from spam

506
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,559
house that

507
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,080
that tags yeses because of repeated

508
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,440
criminal behavior

509
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,320
and we found that 84 of the network's

510
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,240
flag bar classifier are in the spam

511
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,840
house asn drop list

512
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,640
this means that network flag buyer

513
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,159
classifier are 10 times more likely

514
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,679
to be in this block list that the

515
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,080
networks that were not flagged by our

516
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,840
classifier

517
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,280
then we looked if any of these

518
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,000
iss had originated prefixes at the same

519
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,440
time that they

520
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
had been blacklisted in spam

521
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,600
blacklist and it turns out that about a

522
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,679
third of them

523
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,799
have originated prefixes that end up

524
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,400
being blacklisted

525
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,679
at the same time then

526
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
we looked for indications of

527
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,520
misconfiguration

528
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,559
and in that we uh find that a little bit

529
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,559
over a hundred

530
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,480
of the networks number the aess that we

531
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,039
find are actually private ess

532
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,960
that should not be using bgp and because

533
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,559
there are misconfigurations and

534
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,000
they happen all around the network and

535
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,480
they're quickly corrected

536
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,799
they appear to have uh when looking at

537
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,840
just one network very volatile behavior

538
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,879
and this is what gets caught by a

539
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,439
classifier

540
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,919
and also we find that all the single

541
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,400
digit ideas are caught by a classifier

542
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,080
and

543
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,679
these come from these five fingers

544
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,879
errors when

545
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,120
configuring sometimes the border routers

546
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
these numbers are added at the end uh

547
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,760
for doing some pre-pending

548
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,320
but because of mistakes they they appear

549
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,360
to be

550
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,879
the origin in bgp and it happens again

551
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,559
all around the network they're quickly

552
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,720
corrected and it looks like these

553
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,240
networks have a very volatile behavior

554
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
and connecting multiple points of the

555
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,320
network

556
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
which is the behavior flag fire

557
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,320
classifier

558
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,559
and finally we look at another category

559
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,960
of known of false positive

560
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,120
which is networks that offers ddos

561
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,240
protection on vgp

562
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,280
to do so these networks actually

563
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,840
originate a prefix or subprefix from the

564
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
client

565
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,240
where they're under attack and this is a

566
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
benign sort of hijacking

567
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,080
and again this is exactly the behavior

568
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,240
that we want our classifier to

569
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,080
flag and this is why uh we flag these

570
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,640
networks

571
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,760
so after looking at all these categories

572
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,720
we're left with

573
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,520
uh 441 networks which we cannot

574
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,280
immediately find in these categories

575
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,799
but in these uh 400 over 400 networks

576
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,120
there's still some pretty interesting

577
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,440
networks so this is a network for which

578
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,559
we couldn't really find any um

579
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,120
evidence but looking at its behavior

580
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,799
it turns out that um over half of the

581
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,840
prefixes that it originated

582
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,879
last for less than 12 hours and

583
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,760
um over 80 percent of the prefixes

584
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,360
originate

585
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,600
are also being originated by other

586
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,678
networks at the same time

587
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,799
and honestly i think this is really

588
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,960
interesting and

589
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,918
uh part of our future research is to try

590
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,840
to understand

591
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,919
any legitimate reasons why your network

592
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,120
would behave this way

593
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,520
so just to conclude um

594
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,120
43 of the networks that are flagged by a

595
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,360
classifier we can find them

596
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,039
in one of these uh known categories but

597
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,840
they're still these uh

598
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,240
very interesting 47 percent left of

599
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,959
networks

600
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,640
so we know that our classifier is not a

601
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,320
bulletproof identifier of malicious iss

602
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,039
again we are just looking um for aess

603
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,360
that exhibit

604
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,520
similar behavior to a hijacker not

605
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,360
necessarily malicious behavior

606
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,280
and we also know that this doesn't

607
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,360
capture all kinds of behavior

608
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
we're really looking at this repetitive

609
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,600
sort of behavior

610
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,640
and also we're heavily focused on prefix

611
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,120
origination

612
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,200
so this is just prefix hijack and would

613
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,199
not include something like path hijack

614
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,120
so this work uh for the first time we

615
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,640
bring to light

616
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,399
these networks that we call serial

617
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,440
hijackers and study their

618
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,039
um their behavior in bgp and

619
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,039
with the different features that we

620
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,520
derived to understand

621
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,799
how benign behavior differs from the

622
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,039
serial hijackers

623
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,280
they indeed end up giving us a state of

624
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,600
affairs of bgp wide behavior of network

625
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,360
and the outcome of a classifier can

626
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,320
indeed be used

627
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,639
in network reputation scoring system as

628
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,840
an

629
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,559
additional input and finally

630
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,520
our classifier really narrows our focus

631
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,480
on these more

632
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,679
interesting networks which we would like

633
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,799
to understand

634
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,799
uh their behavior in the future

635
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,639
and with that i'd love to get your

636
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,000
feedback on

637
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,799
how to how to continue this line of

638
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
research

639
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,960
so that this information could at some

640
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,679
point be integrated in operational

641
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:55,840
practice

642
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:55,840
to make routing more secure thank you

643
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,240
yeah thank you cecilia and welcome

644
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,200
so we have you live here let's go and

645
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,280
check if

646
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,400
our audience has had any questions for

647
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,720
you uh

648
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,600
okay so i'm just trying to scroll

649
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,240
through and see

650
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,520
okay so it doesn't look like uh other

651
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,679
than the fact that uh

652
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,440
people you know uh concur with the fact

653
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,039
that past fingering has led to a lot of

654
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,640
problems i don't see

655
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,640
a lot of questions but let me ask you

656
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,760
something i found it very interesting

657
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,440
not coming from a security domain but in

658
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,559
terms of the data that you collected

659
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,120
what were the challenges

660
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,559
that you faced in collection because you

661
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,360
have to make sure you have good data so

662
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,000
that your

663
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,799
model and your machine learning can give

664
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,799
you

665
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,760
more legitimate and real-world results

666
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,158
um so i think uh what is challenging is

667
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,400
that these collectors captures

668
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,520
the bgp data as it goes in the protocol

669
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
and as

670
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,679
happens with the false positive there's

671
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,880
a lot of mistakes that can go

672
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,400
in in this protocol so um for example

673
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,720
gathering this data um

674
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,480
i could sometimes have a prefix coming

675
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
from an origin that only one collector

676
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
could see

677
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,960
but how could i be sure maybe it's some

678
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,399
stall router that is sending that

679
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,240
information or something happening in

680
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,480
the collector so i need to discard it

681
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,080
so a lot of it at the beginning was

682
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,640
trying to understand

683
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,918
the data that i was dealing with and how

684
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,120
could i be certain

685
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,919
um after studying the data that certain

686
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,760
part of it

687
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,080
everybody was seeing it and that's when

688
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,919
um we started looking at visibility

689
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,279
and for example all the things that were

690
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,600
really not visible for

691
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,200
like one or two points uh by then we

692
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
discarded them because

693
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
those could be just very local

694
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,520
misconfigurations

695
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,719
okay and i believe i see a question on

696
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,440
the chat

697
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
so uh it seems hijackers also need a

698
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,000
real link

699
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,399
to get into the internet to be able to

700
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,400
uh create disruption

701
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,640
so have you uh in your research have you

702
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,400
investigated patterns

703
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,240
who these serial bgp hijackers peer with

704
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,080
do you have any uh date or any insights

705
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,320
into that

706
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,439
um yeah i think that's a really

707
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,760
interesting question

708
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,559
and uh it's something that i'm working

709
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,520
on as a

710
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,200
future research and for example well

711
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,799
starting with this list of hijackers

712
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
something that i'm kind of investigating

713
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,360
now

714
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,640
i realized that sometimes some of them

715
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,559
since they're originating

716
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,480
they have the same next hop and

717
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,320
somehow it seems that some of them have

718
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,960
this structure where you have this

719
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,678
maybe this next club that is not the one

720
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,360
um

721
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,039
doing the hijack like the origin high

722
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,240
tech but is the one that has the link to

723
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,640
the rest of the network

724
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,159
that is pro um providing for them a way

725
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,080
to get into the network

726
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,520
but it so that's one thing so there's

727
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,879
definitely some structure and how they

728
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,879
get connected to the network that is

729
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,000
really interesting to investigate

730
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,080
the other thing is for example in the

731
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,480
case of a bit canal the hijacker that

732
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,639
was

733
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,240
disconnected um after this lengthy

734
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,320
emission to nanog

735
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,760
they reconnect to another point of the

736
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,000
network so they were disconnected from

737
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
by

738
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,880
some transit provider and then they

739
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
found out a smaller one that could give

740
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,080
them connection and

741
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,879
they got connected again so i think this

742
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,600
is kind of

743
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
um cutting uh and it'd be interesting

744
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,039
that

745
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,159
um main like a large part of the network

746
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,520
actually blocks them

747
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,760
because otherwise they can always find

748
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,400
kind of connections

749
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,799
okay so now we have some uh other

750
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,960
interesting questions popping up

751
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,080
in terms of the speed of your machine

752
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,559
learning processing

753
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,439
are you able to process a real-time

754
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,639
stream of pgp updates

755
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,200
um i haven't uh

756
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,799
checked the the real time i think we we

757
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,640
would have a lag for maybe

758
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,158
half a day or something like that as it

759
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,480
is for the moment so

760
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,279
because this was a historical analysis

761
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,279
um

762
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,799
processing that data took a very long

763
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,440
time because it was like five years of

764
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,600
data

765
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,559
once we have that computed then adding a

766
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,439
year a day of data is much faster

767
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,760
uh and this is based on bgp stream from

768
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,880
uh

769
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,640
cada and that system has about

770
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,039
um i think 30 minutes lag to two hours

771
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,440
lag

772
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,400
um between real time and processing some

773
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
of the

774
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,679
the announcement and that would be like

775
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,760
the faster that we could go

776
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,799
but um this is not the other plugin that

777
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,559
is ready to

778
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,600
perform there and and as far as the time

779
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,000
horizon goes

780
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,240
how long it would take for you as you're

781
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,039
doing your processing and trying to

782
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,480
figure out how long would it take for

783
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,240
you to classify

784
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,840
for your classifier to go ahead and flag

785
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,559
a hijacker

786
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,678
so once you have this in a live stream

787
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,879
oh if i'm seeing

788
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,960
well it depends on the amount of

789
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
historical data that i have so some

790
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,080
sincerely that we've seen is that with

791
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,080
less than three months of historical

792
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,799
data from a network it's

793
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,320
it's much harder to figure out is it um

794
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,320
doing a lot of hijacks or not

795
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,640
okay okay all right and in terms of uh

796
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,520
there's another question

797
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,520
uh that is post on the chat is that uh

798
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,600
have you guys been using geolocation as

799
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,080
an input as well

800
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,000
we haven't been using geolocation as an

801
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,600
input what we've been using that it's

802
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,039
not as close as um the rier that is

803
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,520
delegating the ip

804
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,799
prefixes that are being used by the

805
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,279
different networks

806
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,760
and uh we're checking the concentration

807
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,799
of the resources that the networks use

808
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,840
in the different irs okay all right i

809
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,559
think we have

810
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,000
time for about as many questions but if

811
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,360
there are any more that come through

812
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,440
i'll make sure

813
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,279
pass them on to you so that we can get

814
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,360
them addressed but thank you so much

815
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,399
this was a very uh refreshing and

816
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,879
insightful talk and

817
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,559
uh for a novice like me who shies away

818
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,279
from security i definitely learned a

819
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,678
thing or two

820
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:45,840
thank you so much thank you for having

821
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,840
me bye

822
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,479
you
