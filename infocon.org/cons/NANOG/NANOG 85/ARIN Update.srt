our fee harmonization

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,119
membership structure

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,200

uh ayana class e update

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
as as we're looking at it from the erin

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,600
uh point of view

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
waitlist transfers and community grant

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
program give you some quick information

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
on that

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,439
so fee harmonization updates um

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,240
we're getting pretty positive um in

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,520
input from uh the customers uh

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,079
for what what happened there was uh we

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,680
had two different structures we had a

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,520
structure for isps we had a structure

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,960
for end users

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,920
we

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,320
uh this year january first we flattened

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,280
that structure to where everyone pays

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
based on the number of ips

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
so

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
basically everybody pays the same the

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
same fees based on how how many uh

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,758
either ipv4 ipv6 whichever is the

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,120
greater

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
cost that's what what each organization

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,959
pays

54
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,200
um

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
while doing this it allowed a lot of uh

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
believe it or not a lot of the end users

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,239
that were under the uh

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:24,959
the

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
uh maintenance fee structure um

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,080
a lot of their

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
fees went up not a whole lot but

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,160
um you know some went up from like 300

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,200
to 500 500 to a thousand

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,560
um

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
it just uh a lot of the end users ended

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
up reaching out to us and they saying

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
hey what happened last year we paid this

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,319
much now we're paying this much

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
okay thank you

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,920
um

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,000
so you can hear me now all right i can

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,599
move out from behind i think

73
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,280
so um

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
we we flattened the fee structure

75
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,360
everybody basically pays the same fees

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,599
one result of that

77
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,519
is that people started calling saying

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
hey my fees went up why did they go up

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,959
and we got to talk to these people and

80
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,879
explain to them

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,640
you know well what we did is we

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
flattened the fee schedule so that

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
everyone was paying the same fees

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
um

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
it used to be the reason i guess the

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,760
reason they had the dual fee structure

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,879
was because

88
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,720
in 20 years ago

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
it was more work for uh

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,319
isps because we had to do swips and all

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,920
that kind of stuff that end users didn't

92
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,720
do

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
plus i'm told there was another reason

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,840
was that

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
the isps had to come in so often for

96
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,239
ipspace that we didn't want to charge

97
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,000
them like every two months for a new

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,560
block so we just charged them an annual

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
fee

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
so we we did away with that now

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
everybody pays the same fee structure

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
um

103
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,879
i guess i probably just talked about all

104
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
this i have a habit of doing that with

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
slides i cover a whole bunch of them all

106
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
at one time

107
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
uh so

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,319
we'll go on to the membership structure

109
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
so the one thing that by

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
flattening the fee structure we also

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,358
flatten the membership structure

112
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,478
so

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,639
we're now calling everybody service

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,000
members

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
and any service member can become a

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
general member and vote in the erin

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,560
elections they just have to apply for it

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
we grandfathered in the seven or eight

119
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,400
thousand general members we had

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
um of those

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
um six

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
seven eight thousand

123
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
usually about 600 organizations voted

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,000
every year in the election

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
so eventually

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,320
though some of those general members

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
will end up becoming just a service

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
member and will no longer be eligible to

129
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560
vote and without applying for it

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,919
um

131
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
but what it actually what it what else

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,039
it did what it opened up the voting and

133
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,280
participating in the governance of aaron

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,039
to all the end users that were our

135
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,600
customers for all these years

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
so if you're a service member now that

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,400
got transitioned from end user to a

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,919
service member

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,320
all you have to do is apply for general

140
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,400
membership you check a little box saying

141
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,080
that you plan to vote in the earned

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,160
elections and you get granted general

143
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,639
membership you give us a voting contact

144
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,240
and you can now vote in the election to

145
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,960
participate

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,199
um

147
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,479
all right that's enough with that we'll

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,360
go into some rpki stats just some quick

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,800
stats that we're going to throw out

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,280
there a growing number of organizations

151
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,600
are using our services

152
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,880
um we've had uh

153
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,639
uh 23 increase in 2022 already and a 42

154
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,400
year-over-year so from last year at this

155
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,280
time

156
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,000
to uh this year where we have 15 222

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
more rows

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
and uh resource service are as you can

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,600
see

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,080
basically follow the same pattern 21

161
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,400
this year and 50

162
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
irr update

174
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,319
we

175
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,560
did turn that off on

176
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,840
april 4th this year

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
we had a team that was on call

178
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,840
and monitoring 24 7

179
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,599
any

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,599
issues that were brought up to us or any

181
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
tickets opened by any customers

182
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,400
uh and we were responding in real time

183
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,479
support for those customers

184
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,919
there was very little follow-up

185
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,199
activities um driven in a large part we

186
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,680
did a very active communication customer

187
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,080
support campaign prior to the shutdown

188
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,319
we did have an issue with

189
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,800
contacting some of the

190
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
pox on some of the

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,280
objects in the irr because

192
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,240
they were put in their back 20 years ago

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,960
and those pox were no longer around

194
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,680
um and people were still using

195
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
those route objects to build filter

196
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,919
lists and stuff but there was nobody to

197
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,160
contact because nobody had ever updated

198
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,599
the

199
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,400
actual object

200
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
we did have a little bit of help too i

201
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,199
think

202
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,520
i think the fact that rad b stopped

203
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
mirroring us a week before we shut down

204
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,000
kind of helped

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
helped us anyway i don't know if it

206
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,759
helped the community

207
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,120
and then

208
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
i think alt db actually

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,319
mirrored everything that that was in the

210
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,879
air and non-off some people liked it

211
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
some people didn't like it so much

212
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
um

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
quick update on the ipv4 wait list

214
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,000
we still have some wait list resources

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
but

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
we're anticipating that they uh

217
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,120
get very very scarce after this year um

218
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,199
actually we haven't been able to fill

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,879
the whole waiting list the last two

220
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,160
quarters

221
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
and we probably won't fill a waiting

222
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,759
list completely wipe out a waiting list

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,520
anytime soon

224
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,039
we have one rather large block of ips

225
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,320
that

226
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,519
will be coming available

227
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,000
probably not this next quarter but

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,599
fourth quarter

229
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,640
um

230
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
that that could

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
fill maybe three to four hundred

232
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
organizations but i think we're sitting

233
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,399
around 500 right now and we'll be

234
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,399
building up to that time so

235
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
i don't think we're going to be

236
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,120
actually cleaning that list like we did

237
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
for the last year and a half

238
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,040
the starting in 2023 the only

239
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,360
resources we'll have to give back out

240
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
will be resources that were either

241
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,839
returned or revoked

242
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,320
12 months prior to that we wait 12

243
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
months

244
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
to clean them and make sure that they're

245
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
not being used nobody's going to come

246
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
back in and reclaim them

247
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,500
and

248
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,800
[Music]

249
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,760
that they're not on any spam lists and

250
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
and our block lists and things like that

251
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
so

252
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,959
that's what takes a little bit of time

253
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
to turn those around once we receive

254
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
them back

255
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,800
transfer is completed in q1 2022

256
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,399
um

257
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,080
so our mergers acquisitions and

258
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,760
reorganizations

259
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,600
uh there were 175 transfers completed

260
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,839
in the first quarter this year

261
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,000
it seems to grow every year of those 175

262
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,160
transfers there was 23 346-24

263
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
involved in it

264
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
um that that's actually quite a bit

265
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,160
where it's going up uh it's probably

266
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,120
double from what we had q1 last year

267
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
transfers to specified recipients within

268
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,480
the erin region there was 217 completed

269
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,880
uh that accounted for 10 084 slash 24s

270
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,200
and then the inter rir transfers there

271
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
was 82 completed

272
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
and

273
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
something is a little different from the

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,519
past years

275
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,240
as you notice the inbound

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
actually exceeds the outbound so more

277
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,279
addresses came into the erin region then

278
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,320
went out

279
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
and that is a direct opposite of what's

280
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
been happening over the last four years

281
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,600
i'm told that the reason that's

282
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
happening is

283
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
because the uh low-hanging fruit for ips

284
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
in the aran region have um

285
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,760
have kind of dried up a little bit

286
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,640
so that the uh the larger buyers are

287
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,120
actually going out of region to find

288
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,959
address space to obtain

289
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,000
so we have uh aaron has a community grab

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
grant program

291
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
we're in the last call we actually

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,440
extended it to june 15th because we

293
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,839
didn't have any

294
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,519
applicants at the date

295
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,640
that it was

296
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,120
set to expire

297
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
there's four categories that the project

298
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
must fit into

299
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
internet technical improvements registry

300
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,959
processes and improvement informational

301
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,240
outreach that advances the internet

302
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
and research related to aaron's mission

303
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
and operations

304
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
and then you can see down there the top

305
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,399
five reasons to apply

306
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,079
free funding increased project

307
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,680
visibility

308
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
i can't read that

309
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
receive support from the start

310
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,639
solve a problem faced by the internet

311
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,760
community

312
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,639
or provide access

313
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,639
to valuable education and tools

314
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,560
uh

315
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
i and a class e update uh i know the

316
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
last at the last analog there was a

317
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,079
um

318
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,959
a lot of discussion about this

319
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,920
um thing that's going through the uh i

320
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,639
think it's good it's an rfc um

321
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,680
that

322
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
has been or a draft that's been proposed

323
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,200
designated as unicast

324
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
uh people were wondering what would

325
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
happen if it was well from an errand

326
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
perspective

327
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
right now we really don't know what

328
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,079
would happen

329
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,160
there would have to be some policy

330
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,800
probably a global policy to say how

331
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
ayanna was going to issue that to the

332
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,440
rirs and then each one of the rirs would

333
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
have to come up with a policy of how to

334
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,200
give that out to the community

335
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,959
um so aaron 49 we held there in 49 in

336
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
nashville

337
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,720
uh last month

338
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,800
actually the month before last now time

339
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,480
is flying

340
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,320
there's a meeting report up at the url

341
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
that's on there we had a really good
