00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
ipv4 address acquisition this is amy's

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
second time presenting at nanog

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
amy's first talk in anag was called how

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,039
to navigate ipv4 space in a post-run out

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,880
world at nanox 68 in dallas in the year

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,439
2016.

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,599
welcome back to nanog amy please

14

introduce us to your panelists

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,079
yo

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,000
hi everyone

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
so we are here

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
on the ten year anniversary of ipv6

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
world launch day to talk about the ipv4

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,719
market

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,840
we've got

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,719
a great panel here with

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,319
panelists that each play a different

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,119
role within the ipv4 market

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,080
so

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,880
let's start out with introductions john

registry for internet numbers and i get

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
a little bit involved in transfers

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,720
philly

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,439
i'm bill sylvester i run adrack's

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,000
marketplace for ipv4

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
have been around for a long time in the

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,280
industry

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,799
both in domain names and ip numbers

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,960
hi i'm tina morris i run ip strategy at

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,200
aws

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,520
hi and i'm chris drumgool i'm the chief

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,000
operating officer at dxe technology and

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,759
uh relevant to this conversation before

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,520
this i was the global cio for general

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
electric

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
cool i'd like to start out by addressing

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
the elephant in the room and that's ipv6

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
tina chris you have both participated in

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,079
the ipv4 market in the past uh does your

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
participation in the market indicate a

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
lack of commitment ipv6 have your

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,200
organizations deployed ipv6

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,520
uh tina let's start with you okay

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,840
so aws is extremely committed to ipv6 um

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
it is just it takes a while to get there

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
right we have to convert every service

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
and do everything um we cannot single

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,360
thread our efforts just into b4 that's

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
not sustainable it's not possible

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,560
we look at it like we're solving the v4

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
problem for our customers until they're

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,959
ready to go to b6 naturally and natively

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,280
and on by default

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
and um in fact we even um encourage our

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,959
customers our sellers when we're dealing

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,280
with them to take the funds and revamp

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
their network and even launch v6 as well

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
because we want them to take that

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
opportunity with that large sum of cash

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,920
and go do something really good with it

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,280
that makes sure they don't have any

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,560
technical debt going forward

72
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,599
yeah no i think uh you know i'm kind of

73
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,879
the one that doesn't belong on the stage

74
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,720
because we're an enterprise versus being

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
in the business

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
so i think probably similar to a lot of

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
the companies you work for it's a bit of

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,480
a different myth so

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,040
i i would say from a philosophical point

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,400
of view

81
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
we absolutely believe in six it's

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,040
obviously the future it's the way the

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,480
world is going to

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,200
but

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,640
just like everybody else who works at a

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,519
big company uh the technical team and

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,879
the technology team understanding that

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,480
doesn't always match everybody else who

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,799
needs to pay for it understanding that

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,000
and i think that's where the kind of

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
rubber meets the road so

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,159
my experience both a g and a dxc has

93
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,560
been actually as tina just alluded to

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,599
is using the opportunity to leverage our

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,000
ipv4 space to enable the transition to

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
v6 so that's exactly what we think about

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,799
it is how do we

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,519
kind of take this uh asset that most

99
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,599
companies don't even realize they have

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,120
don't know they have

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,480
frankly most people outside of the

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
technical team don't even understand the

103
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
value of or or even what it does for a

104
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
living

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,439
and then translate that into funding

106
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,200
that we can then use to execute the

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
transformation to v6

108
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,720
now is that easier said than done yes so

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,159
in the case of you know i don't want to

110
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,360
speak for my previous company but a

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,519
little bit g or dxc

112
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,439
you know it's a journey and and you

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,880
typically selling the address space

114
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,798
gives you the first step in that journey

115
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,238
to begin to isolate yourself and to

116
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,839
begin the process kind of a slow

117
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,120
transformation

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
but it does become

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,479
the

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
rare i would say

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
kind of unicorn rare in corporate

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
america or anywhere in the world

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,880
corporate where

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,680
kind of you can actually have a

125
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,919
technology that pays for itself and not

126
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,400
in the bsc or i have a great roi look

127
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,919
how much you pay for itself like no cash

128
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,960
money

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
like we did this and you got a check uh

130
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,880
so that's been our experience with it

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
and kind of that's why we're committed

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
to to making that transformation to v6

133
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
okay and john you're in a really

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,840
interesting position at the rar because

135
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
you have visibility into the address

136
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,160
holdings of transfer market participants

137
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
both before and after the transfers what

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,440
are you seeing

139
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
at the rir level are does it look like

140
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
the people that are participating in

141
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,000
this market have just abandoned the idea

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
of ipv6 altogether or do they sort of

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
have both resources going on at once

144
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,919
yeah great question um we've seen over

145
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,840
time year over year approximately 30

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
of our source

147
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,479
organizations that are selling ipv4

148
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,360
about 30 percent of them have v6 and

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
have had v6

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,120
they part of that is because a lot of

151
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,039
the transfers are people um

152
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,360
people that have ipv4 and they're not

153
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
using it and they're actually

154
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,720
selling the v4 and then once they sell

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
it all their organization goes away so

156
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,840
it's probably a higher percentage that

157
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,560
actually are deploying v6 along at the

158
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,440
same time they're selling uh the v4 and

159
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,400
then on the re recipient side

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,080
it's a it runs about 50 of them uh the

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,160
organizations buying ipv4 have ipv6 with

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,840
about 20 percent of that 50 percent

163
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,039
getting v6 after they have purchased v4

164
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:17,919
so

165
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,759
i don't think that it just shows they're

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,639
running from v6 at all

167
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
cool so we've we've touched a little bit

168
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,720
on this idea of

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
sellers using the proceeds from the the

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
sale of their access ipv4 addresses to

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,240
fund some improvements in their network

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
potentially deploy ipv6 i'd like to dig

173
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,039
into that a little bit further

174
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,400
um

175
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
chris when when an organization is is

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,880
going through that process they're

177
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
planning to sell off their space to to

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,800
use those funds for

179
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,720
for some work within their network

180
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
oftentimes the process of doing that

181
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
requires going through some sort of

182
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,639
renumbering which is something that

183
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,479
sometimes engineers can have a little

184
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,880
bit of anxiety about what they're going

185
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,199
to find when they they open up the hood

186
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,919
there

187
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,400
what kind of advice can you provide to

188
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
other organizations that are thinking

189
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,680
about going through that process to get

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
comfortable

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,479
to to sort of take the first steps

192
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,520
forward

193
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,440
well first of all stay calm

194
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
i would say that's the um

195
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,759
the first reaction i think

196
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,120
um

197
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
listen it's interesting i i obviously

198
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,000
sit on the business side now but i grew

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,599
up as a network person so i have a

200
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
perspective for it but i was sharing

201
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,800
this story before we uh before we came

202
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
into the panel when i started it at ge

203
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
my first day and i was in technology i

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,319
got my laptop and it had a public

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,360
address

206
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,880
inside the company

207
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,880
and you're kind of like

208
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
how's this work um

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,720
and and then once we kind of decided we

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,080
were going to sell it our own technical

211
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,199
team who i love some of them are

212
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
actually here uh you know uh

213
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,840
we had three we had class a3 uh

214
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
nicknamed the process of selling the

215
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,039
three apocalypse because they were so

216
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,199
nervous about what was going to happen

217
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,319
if we sold it so again i start with stay

218
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,360
calm

219
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
like we've all figured out how to run

220
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,360
network technology and like i alluded to

221
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,479
before

222
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,879
it's the one time when you have a cash

223
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,360
check coming in to run the process so

224
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
you're not going to the cfo and asking

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
her for money you're going and telling

226
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
her how much you're going to give her

227
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,879
and that's a very different conversation

228
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,360
because you're saying hey by the way

229
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
i'm going to get you a check for x

230
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,199
dollars and by the way i'm keeping a

231
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,240
little bit and you're going to get a new

232
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,879
network out of it now i think so i think

233
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,399
and that's fundamental it's i've

234
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,599
approached it that at three different

235
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,200
companies now with my partners here and

236
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
it's worked very well but i think to the

237
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,719
kind of technical aspect of it it's also

238
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,640
the one time we focused a lot on v6 for

239
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,159
the first half of the conversation yes

240
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
that's important but it's not only where

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
it ends right it's

242
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
it gives you the opportunity to kind of

243
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,880
erase your technical debt for years all

244
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,959
the things like publicly addressed

245
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,399
laptops that everybody in the company

246
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,839
knows doesn't make sense but no one

247
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,560
really has the time money energy effort

248
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
or opportunity cost to fix it gives you

249
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,000
that license

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,080
like again i really can't understand how

251
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,680
powerful it is to be showing up with a

252
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
check

253
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,959
for an asset that your average board of

254
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,640
directors literally doesn't even

255
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
understand what it is when you're

256
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
describing it to them

257
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
um and so it really does give you an

258
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
opportunity to get a new network you

259
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,839
basically get a new network and you get

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
to be a hero if you're sitting on the

261
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
enterprise side that oversimplifies it a

262
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
lot there's a ton of work that goes into

263
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
that

264
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
but if you approach it that way i think

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
it's a really easy way to facilitate a

266
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
transaction my advice would be

267
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,200
understand what it costs to do the work

268
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
before you even talk about the

269
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,160
transaction

270
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
because just kind of let's all use human

271
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
nature speak in net numbers from day one

272
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
the amount of money you can get is x and

273
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,920
x already includes the cost of redoing

274
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,160
your network don't sell them on x and

275
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,000
then convince why you have to go do the

276
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,040
network after that's very good advice

277
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
yeah and billy you're in kind of an

278
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
interesting role as

279
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
you run a marketplace you have to you

280
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,079
know get sellers to to come participate

281
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,600
in that and i'm sure you've had some

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,279
similar conversations

283
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,600
uh when it comes to some level of work

284
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
that they have to do to clear off the

285
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,959
space before they're ready to sell it

286
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,040
what kind of advice can you give for

287
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
getting buy-in uh from the higher up

288
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,959
parts parts of the organization there

289
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,519
so from our perspective we encounter a

290
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,440
lot of different um

291
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
levels within the organization

292
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
when we're dealing with the c-suite and

293
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
the cfo

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
that one's very easy because they always

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,640
want money

296
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,920
and

297
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
so it's very easy to say hi you're going

298
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,240
to get all this money and

299
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,760
your expenses are not going to be that

300
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,839
much against this money and

301
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,600
normally it starts a conversation that

302
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,760
says you mean i got this for free

303
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,279
and now i can sell it for something

304
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,120
that's worth a lot of money or multiple

305
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,160
commas

306
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
and you have any more yeah

307
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,839
they're like can you look and see if we

308
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,600
have any more of these

309
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
as as we start to work though

310
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
within deep technical organizations you

311
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
have a very different perspective in

312
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
that

313
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,440
most engineers start off with a fear of

314
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,800
oh my gosh we're going to need this and

315
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,399
you know that sort of

316
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
struggles with that whole we're moving

317
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
to ipv6 but we need to keep all of our

318
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,760
v4

319
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,279
from our perspective we don't see that

320
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,760
v4 and v6 compete

321
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,680
we see that v4 is going to be around for

322
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
certain legacy networks for a long time

323
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
even as we get critical mass within v6

324
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
and we need to continue to work towards

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,959
that

326
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,800
and within engineering organizations

327
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,480
there's usually projects that are

328
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,839
underfunded

329
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,640
and

330
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
i probably everyone in here has had some

331
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
sort of project where

332
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,800
your manager your boss the cfo said oh

333
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
we don't have money for that this year

334
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
we'll try again next year

335
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,120
and

336
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,279
within those years it's very easy to

337
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,839
take what's called budget offsets and

338
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,519
within those budget offsets you can

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,880
receive money

340
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,760
um

341
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,000
to offset the expense within the same

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,480
year and it is chris sort of alluded to

343
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
the

344
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
the idea of showing up with with real

345
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,639
numbers and real statistics and this is

346
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,079
going to cost us

347
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,560
specifically this much money and based

348
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,599
off of that we're going to find

349
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,360
revenue that's going to come in and that

350
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
revenue is going to have no cost other

351
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,920
than our internal manpower and

352
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
additional hardware

353
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,639
we're gonna do

354
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,639
and so it's been very successful

355
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,079
for

356
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,440
non-financial

357
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,839
folks to basically say okay this is a

358
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,760
way that we're gonna find money to fund

359
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,360
some of these projects

360
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,760
and we've had great success

361
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,880
in finding that type of support from the

362
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,320
c-suite

363
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
so we're talking here about you know

364
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,800
going in with this this sales pitch

365
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,480
within your orga we're going to be able

366
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,120
to bring in this amount of money for

367
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,279
these assets

368
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,920
how do you figure out what what is this

369
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,000
amount of money the ip address market is

370
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
incredibly opaque it's difficult to

371
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,519
figure out how much an ip address is

372
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,839
going to cost every any given point in

373
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,560
time when you're dealing with a new

374
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
buyer new seller that's not familiar

375
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
with the market

376
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,519
how how do you help them figure out what

377
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
the appropriate

378
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,920
value for an ip addresses at that given

379
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
moment

380
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,240
i'm sorry billy

381
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
okay

382
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,240
so

383
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,399
pricing is very very challenging it's

384
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,560
very easy to go online and search and

385
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,279
find a wide variety of pricing and

386
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,200
you have to take a lot of that

387
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
uh it

388
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
skeptically because

389
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,199
what you find is that may have been a

390
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,880
transaction for

391
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,480
a different size block that may have

392
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,120
been encumbered block meaning there was

393
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,360
some sort of work or other issues you

394
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,560
may have had

395
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
custody issues

396
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,160
from that perspective

397
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,240
ultimately it's worth what one party is

398
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,760
willing to pay for it and another party

399
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
is willing to sell it for

400
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,120
and then the connection of those two

401
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,920
parties equals a transaction

402
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,800
we often provide guidance for buyers to

403
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,639
look at their business models and to

404
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,120
understand the revenue that's derived

405
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,000
from an individual ip address

406
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
that can be stacked on top of that

407
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
build that into their business model and

408
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,839
understand some sort of return on

409
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,600
investment within that

410
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
that identifies what they're able to

411
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
afford that doesn't necessarily identify

412
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,320
what they want to spend

413
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,120
and

414
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
everyone wants to spend as little as

415
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
possible from a buy sign

416
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
as as sellers are looking at the same

417
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
problem they often go online

418
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,519
and say oh i saw this number on on a

419
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,760
website or i saw this number come across

420
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,199
in an email

421
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,079
and

422
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,360
you know at the end of the day it's

423
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
ultimately what are you willing to sell

424
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,800
that for

425
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,680
in certain cases if you're unwilling to

426
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
sell it at a lower price but you're more

427
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,440
willing to sell it at a higher price

428
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
those are some of the economics and

429
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,839
market dynamics that come into play

430
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,760
you know as we look at

431
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,800
the overall market and how

432
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,399
they determine pricing and there are

433
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,320
several other industries that you see

434
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,079
similar type things

435
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,240
um certain organizations

436
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
will have to spend a certain amount of

437
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,360
money to clean up their network to

438
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,279
repurpose their network to to develop

439
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,480
their networks

440
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,680
nextgen networks and that is the

441
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,600
baseline for what they need to spend to

442
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,399
get it out there and if it's not worth

443
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,399
the effort and the time the energy and

444
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,680
and what they might consider to be a

445
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,360
distraction

446
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
they're going to demand higher prices

447
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,440
just add that for a second because i

448
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
think as someone who's pitched this to

449
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,199
more than one board for pretty material

450
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,360
numbers that is the second question

451
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
you're going to get after you get over

452
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,519
the what the hell's an ip address

453
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,720
the next question is going to be

454
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
everybody in that room who has a

455
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,480
fiduciary responsibility to their

456
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,079
shareholders asking you how to

457
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,680
understand the market

458
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,639
and at the risk of sounding campy

459
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,959
it does come down to trust a little bit

460
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,120
and doing business with people that you

461
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
can establish a relationship with it is

462
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
the transactions themselves aren't

463
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,480
complicated it's actually amazing how

464
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,079
short the forms are that you actually do

465
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,600
the transaction on

466
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,360
but you're entering into a marriage make

467
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,480
no mistake

468
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,759
because it's going to take you some time

469
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,040
to clean things up it's going to take

470
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,360
the new person time to use them and

471
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,000
you're going to be friends or enemies

472
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,160
for the next several years

473
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,440
and you got to factor that into your

474
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
pricing model

475
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,759
so

476
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,040
you know sometimes someone might have a

477
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,600
slightly better or slightly worse terms

478
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,279
but i would just really caution to

479
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,279
understand that it is not a

480
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,959
hey this was great we're done unless

481
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,079
you're luxury unless you have a luxury

482
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,680
if you're not using anything then by all

483
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,040
means call 12 people and get the best

484
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,600
price but if you're in any

485
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,720
if you're anyone who's not in that

486
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
situation

487
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,279
you really need to trust the person

488
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,120
you're selling them to or buying them

489
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,959
from depending on your side of the table

490
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,079
and understanding that you're going to

491
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,079
have a working relationship for years

492
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,839
and i would really factor that into the

493
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,480
price well at the same time one thousand

494
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
percent maintaining your responsibility

495
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to your shareholders or your owners to

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,319
get the best value for their asset but

497
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,640
but don't discount

498
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,919
don't discount doing business with

499
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,679
someone who's you trust and someone is

500
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
reputable in the space yeah absolutely

501
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,559
tina you've bought an iphone address or

502
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,400
two what what are your thoughts on on

503
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,640
figuring out pricing yeah much much of

504
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,559
what um

505
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,640
billy and chris have already alluded to

506
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,280
but uh it's much like the housing market

507
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
just because one house sold in your

508
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,799
county for a million dollars doesn't

509
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,160
mean your house is worth a million

510
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,960
dollars um they have different prices

511
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
based on the time of year the need of

512
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,679
the organization the the cleanliness of

513
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,799
the space the timeline of delivery

514
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
there are so many factors that come into

515
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
it and

516
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
the sellers that haven't done the

517
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
research and are far removed from the

518
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
market often see the highest price they

519
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
can find and they multiply that by their

520
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
number of ips and that's absolutely what

521
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,840
they expect

522
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,600
and there's a lot of you know

523
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,679
speculation pricing out there and

524
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,200
published

525
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,160
that isn't necessarily based on fact

526
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,640
so it can be really tricky we we talked

527
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,720
to a number of brokers a number of

528
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,160
individuals and conferences and there's

529
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,760
just so much word of mouth with this

530
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,000
because there isn't the documentation

531
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,120
to to show um pricing

532
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
so we kind of compile all that

533
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,360
information and and work together to

534
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
figure that out we have trusted we have

535
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
some brokers we work with whenever we're

536
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
talking to brokers we always look at the

537
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,919
all-inclusive price including any fees

538
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,919
anything that they have

539
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,480
rather than the per ip price

540
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
because for us it's the same you know

541
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,760
that's the amount of money my

542
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,520
organization has to

543
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,799
pay to receive the addresses and so we

544
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,799
look at the all-inclusive pricing when

545
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,280
comparing everything

546
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
but yeah it's it's

547
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,039
take the prices you find with a grain of

548
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,919
salt um they're they're not you know do

549
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,200
your research talk to people who have

550
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,039
done sales

551
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,080
talk talk talk talk get referrals before

552
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
you commit to anything or tell your

553
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
leadership that you can get them 85

554
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,720
dollars in ip which i have seen people

555
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,760
offer um not legitimate offers that

556
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
they've tried to get sellers at that

557
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,440
price and to my knowledge that's not

558
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,559
available

559
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,400
so i wouldn't want to walk into my

560
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
leadership with a number that's so

561
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,240
inflated that i can't possibly produce

562
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
an offer to match

563
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
so something that that we're seeing a

564
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,520
bit in the market as as prices go up is

565
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,280
we're seeing an increase in the number

566
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,960
of bad actors and attempts at

567
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
at fraud

568
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,559
uh tina when you're buying space what

569
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,640
kind of steps do you go through

570
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,600
to

571
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
confirm that even the individual you're

572
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,679
talking to has a rights to sell the

573
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,960
space they're trying to sell you

574
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
you look at whether the seller

575
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,440
we're speaking with has the rights at

576
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,000
the rar you look at

577
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,240
the lineage of the space have they owned

578
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
it since or not owned sorry

579
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
has it been registered

580
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,120
to them since the initiation of the

581
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
account or has it changed hands a few

582
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
times can they prove

583
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,520
their status as owner because there is

584
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
some risk

585
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,400
as we talked about earlier

586
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,919
there could be problems with that space

587
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,400
after you take it somebody can already

588
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
be using it a customer

589
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,840
that maybe is impacted when your

590
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,919
organization advertises the block and

591
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,760
for aws we are we are a customer

592
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,720
obsessed if if i

593
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,799
start using a block and it's breaking my

594
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,840
customer

595
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
i have to take action that means i

596
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,240
suddenly can't use that until we resolve

597
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
the issue on one side or the other and

598
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,240
that can get very very ugly so

599
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,720
reputation matters quite a bit making

600
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,559
sure you're doing the deal with the

601
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,880
right organization that they actually

602
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,440
have full rights not just access to an

603
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
account to make the transfer

604
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,520
and john at the rer's i'm sure you see a

605
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
lot of really interesting things

606
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
happening there as people attempt to do

607
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,240
transfers under

608
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,679
a variety of different situations what

609
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,360
kind of advice can you

610
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,720
give about coming prepared and avoiding

611
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,039
potential fraudulent transactions

612
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,760
yeah i think the the best advice if

613
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,880
you're a source organization that's

614
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
looking to transfer

615
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,480
your ipv4 is to actually review your

616
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,520
records at the rir whether it's aaron or

617
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,400
any of the other rars and ensure that

618
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,080
they're registered to

619
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,039
the

620
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,120
company that you're actually

621
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
named at that point in time and and that

622
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,520
you're actually registered

623
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,840
to lawfully do business

624
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,720
um

625
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,360
a lot of times what we see is the

626
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,600
there's been mergers and acquisitions

627
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,679
four five or six of them those are the

628
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,360
really difficult ones because they'll

629
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,880
have their asset purchase agreement from

630
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,280
for maybe two of them but they can't

631
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,320
find it for the third one so it it can

632
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,559
take a lot of time so

633
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,039
the best advice i can give to

634
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,280
organizations looking to source out

635
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,559
their ipv4 is to work with aaron and

636
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,880
make sure that you have

637
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,320
the proper

638
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,280
documentation and that we get that

639
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
those resources into the current

640
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,200
organization that you're you're the

641
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
legal successor to whoever was

642
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,720
originally

643
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,240
issued that space

644
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,159
may i may i add one thing to that just

645
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
looking for john for a moment

646
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,919
aaron is not going to take your space

647
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,400
away if you have this conversation this

648
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,840
isn't a secret this isn't they're not

649
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,200
evil trying to do this they actually

650
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,720
want to facilitate this and keep

651
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,880
registration records as accurate as

652
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
possible we work really really hard to

653
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,200
try

654
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,559
to

655
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,919
make it happen sometimes it just can't

656
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,400
sometimes there are just bad actors out

657
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,440
there that are trying to

658
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,039
put a claim on a slash 16 a legacy space

659
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,200
that they have no right to

660
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,960
but they know a little bit of history

661
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,480
about it and they try to put together

662
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,120
some sort so we really do dig deep and

663
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
those can take quite a while

664
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
but in the end

665
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,600
you know our analysts take a lot of time

666
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,720
but

667
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,080
if you feel like you're not getting

668
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,159
anywhere then it's it's the best thing

669
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,799
to do is just escalate it up to either

670
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,280
lisa who lied out who's the director of

671
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,880
rsd or

672
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,360
directly to me and we will work with you

673
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
we will figure out something

674
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,200
uh what kind of legal documents that we

675
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,679
can get produced by you to

676
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,720
uh

677
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
make us the whole thing we're doing is

678
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,440
we're we're actually trying to protect

679
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,679
the people that are purchasing the space

680
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,279
as well as aaron and the community uh

681
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,240
because you know aaron aaron has a legal

682
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
responsibility to make sure we don't

683
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,120
give somebody's uh

684
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,480
16 away to somebody else so

685
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
we we won't

686
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
just take your space away if we can't

687
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
help you prove that it's yours then

688
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,840
we'll move on and you'll move on

689
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,720
and billy you've handled

690
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,080
a lot of transfers in in your day

691
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,960
uh

692
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,120
what kind of kind of advice can you give

693
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,960
for preparing to make sure that you have

694
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,760
the documents uh that john's referring

695
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,039
to here

696
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,000
so i mean we always start at the the

697
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,520
state level and

698
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,240
in north america

699
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,480
and are working to build that story from

700
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,799
inception and that starts with

701
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,720
an organization that was founded in the

702
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,159
1800s or maybe the early 1900s those

703
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,400
companies were merged those companies

704
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,760
were divested

705
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,840
and and we follow the trail in certain

706
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,760
cases we can only follow the publicly

707
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,000
available information and that's most of

708
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,159
the time where we end up in

709
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,159
good discussions with aaron or or other

710
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,240
registries is identifying that

711
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
documentation that's that's perhaps not

712
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,240
public because

713
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,559
contrary to popular belief there's not a

714
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,679
lot of divestiture docs prior to maybe

715
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,320
2010 or 2015

716
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,000
that explicitly say this ip address goes

717
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
along with this normally it comes in a

718
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,039
form of

719
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,720
all the business operations were

720
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,400
transferred or

721
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,039
all of the

722
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
the network resources were transferred

723
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,840
and that included ip addresses at the

724
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
time

725
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,279
so i mean for us though we like to

726
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,960
follow it from inception

727
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,159
all the way to where we are today

728
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,840
documenting as much publicly available

729
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,039
information

730
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,000
there's

731
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
great resources out there

732
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
through the registries

733
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,679
but it's also helpful to have all that

734
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,360
documentation together ahead of time

735
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,039
because when the registry comes back and

736
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,120
asks for additional information

737
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,039
states or

738
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,360
other legal entities might take a lot of

739
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,919
time especially most large organizations

740
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,320
struggle to get

741
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,480
internal documentation so you have to

742
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,440
start with a patient process

743
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,679
and put all that together

744
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,200
and it's usually helpful if you can get

745
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,279
it all together up front and then go and

746
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,880
ask the registry

747
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,200
versus what i refer to as is you know

748
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,440
death by a thousand paper cuts where you

749
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,360
go back and forth with with each

750
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,440
individual request and then you have

751
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,080
some period of time a week a month six

752
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,120
months

753
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,080
um

754
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,440
and that's the way that you keep these

755
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
transactions

756
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
um

757
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,159
to a point that's manageable

758
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,520
and you're not

759
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,000
spending time and that also increases

760
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
the likelihood that transactions will

761
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,200
succeed

762
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
because the last thing you want to spend

763
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,000
is a year working on a transaction and

764
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
only to have that fall apart because

765
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
somebody can't find a piece of paper

766
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,880
justifying

767
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,240
a source organization

768
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,840
and john what kind of advice do you have

769
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,000
for preparing on the recipient side

770
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
or the buyer

771
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,960
yeah so if you're looking to buy or to

772
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,840
receive

773
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
resources um through the transfer market

774
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,600
the best advice i can give you is to get

775
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
your pre-approval first come in

776
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,799
uh give us the you know the

777
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,679
justifications the

778
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,399
the how much space you need uh i think

779
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,120
it's you can go out to like five years

780
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,480
we're gonna need this much space in the

781
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,840
next five years so that you can buy a

782
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
block size that you're not going to have

783
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,919
to go out to the transfer market you

784
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,679
know every six months or something you

785
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,120
can come in and say here's our business

786
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,360
plan for the next five years

787
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,799
we're we're planning to grow our

788
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,679
customer base by you know 100 percent so

789
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,880
we need 100 more ips than we have today

790
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
and we will up give you that

791
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,960
pre-approval and then you're sitting

792
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,600
there and that it can be chopped up you

793
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,840
can use the pre-approval if you're

794
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,799
pre-approved for uh for a slash 16 you

795
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,320
can go out and

796
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,640
buy a uh

797
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,559
18 and as you need it you can you and

798
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,320
we'll keep we'll just subtract it from

799
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
your pre-approval and and you can use

800
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,559
that uh those are good for i think uh

801
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,679
two years

802
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,880
before you have to come back in and

803
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,640
re-renew it

804
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,279
all right let's talk a little bit about

805
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,520
planning uh in in terms of the

806
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
appropriate amount of time that you

807
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,440
should expect the whole process

808
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
to take

809
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,200
uh

810
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,960
it's

811
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,840
gonna go back to tina you've

812
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,760
done well a few of these what what kind

813
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,440
of expectations should should people

814
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,919
have going in to the process from

815
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,960
starting from the point when they're

816
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,640
either first thinking about selling or

817
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,559
first thinking about buying

818
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,919
so so that's really hard to answer um

819
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,320
it varies if if the space is vacant

820
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,120
today your your red your company is

821
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,760
registered properly with aaron you have

822
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,720
a good relationship with them your

823
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,520
your

824
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,200
executive officer that signing the

825
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,279
contracts is available

826
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,200
we can you know

827
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,919
get to contract quite quickly a transfer

828
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,039
could take

829
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,520
a week two weeks something like that and

830
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,720
then

831
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
payment

832
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
whether you've done escrow or why or

833
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
after is immediately after so the whole

834
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,279
thing could be wrapped up

835
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,520
reasonably i think three weeks is is a

836
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,399
possibility that is the extremely

837
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,760
positive case

838
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,799
extremely positive i

839
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
yes

840
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,399
but most deals even when they happen

841
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,360
that fast have been talked about for a

842
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,120
long long time and um it's rare that

843
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,279
somebody just decides to sell and then

844
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,440
it happens that fast

845
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,760
so the larger ones i've done some have

846
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,799
taken two or three years to get to a

847
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,679
contract to get to the first contract

848
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,279
but typically once we get to the first

849
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,640
contract i usually expect about

850
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
probably two months start to finish

851
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,440
you know for the whole process

852
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,840
from talking the first red lines going

853
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,080
through contracts you know negotiating

854
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
that getting those signed

855
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,360
getting everything in place

856
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,799
it's not super fast

857
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,000
one one thing that we

858
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,960
see sometimes as a part of this process

859
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,039
is sometimes buyers can can be concerned

860
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,279
about the reputation of the block

861
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,679
um can can you talk to you know a little

862
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,000
bit about uh what do you look at in

863
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,399
terms of do you look at block listings

864
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,480
what are you checking out so we look at

865
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,320
everything that's publicly available we

866
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,240
don't have any secret sauce that looks

867
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,399
at you know inside your network so we

868
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,880
can't see if you're using it internally

869
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,279
but we look at the block lists we look

870
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,559
at

871
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,520
the

872
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,679
red b the other irrs the

873
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,720
routing entries all of that we we have a

874
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,360
we have a very lovely tool that somebody

875
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,480
of my staff

876
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,640
built that it's really saved so much

877
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,000
time but

878
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,679
um that looks at everything and um we we

879
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,760
do factor that into the price offered we

880
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,159
do factor that into the consideration

881
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,480
and oftentimes we tell a seller that

882
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,159
they didn't know they were using part of

883
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,720
their space um sometimes they find out

884
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,559
from us that they're still using their

885
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,200
blocks and so

886
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,919
we we do this reporting very early

887
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,159
and let them know um that they need to

888
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,480
get it off of block lists that they um

889
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,880
there's you know some like the russia

890
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,679
block list was a big problem for a while

891
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,840
because nobody could get space off of it

892
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,919
so if it was on that list it was just a

893
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,840
no-go

894
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,679
things like that and so we give them

895
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,919
basically a report i think i think

896
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,519
address does something similar for their

897
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,919
customers and that's their homework to

898
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,080
go figure out they're like oh we didn't

899
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
know these 24s were being advertised

900
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,519
nobody's supposed to be using that it's

901
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,480
like okay so somebody in your org is and

902
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,320
you should know about that before

903
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,600
you you

904
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,679
give them away

905
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,600
there's also registry cleanup that goes

906
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,519
in with that as well cleaning up and

907
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,919
adders cleaning up old routing objects

908
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,480
cleaning up our edb yep uh it's a

909
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
process that we call preparing for sale

910
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,679
uh and that puts the space so that it's

911
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,080
is clean as it can be

912
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,679
when going into transfers and going

913
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,039
through the errand process and making

914
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,799
sure that aaron doesn't have a lot of

915
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,080
headaches for

916
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,399
dealing with sort of orphaned objects or

917
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,799
or other details right

918
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,320
and one thing you need to be careful

919
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,000
especially when you're doing inter r

920
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,880
transfers from from ripe or ap nick or

921
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,720
lac nick

922
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
you have to really look at the history

923
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,440
of that block as as tina mentioned we've

924
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,360
had a few people

925
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,720
that have purchased blocks through um

926
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,679
ripe

927
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,159
uh and they they purchased those blocks

928
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,080
because they they got them cheaper than

929
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,279
the other plaques that were being

930
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,159
offered to them and it ended up like

931
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,399
that they were registered to a russian

932
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,600
company that no banks in the u.s would

933
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,120
let them

934
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,640
let those ips into their you know

935
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,679
access their systems and the isp

936
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,440
happened to do almost all financial

937
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,120
customers so

938
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,559
they bought that block and they couldn't

939
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,159
do anything with it

940
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,480
they had to

941
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,760
unfortunately aaron couldn't do anything

942
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,679
for them they had to go out and purchase

943
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,320
another block

944
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,679
i think i'd be remiss if i didn't touch

945
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,279
on the fact that at least within the

946
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,000
aaron region there is one alternative

947
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,159
option to buying and that's the the wait

948
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,120
list

949
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,880
uh with aaron john do you want to talk a

950
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,159
little bit about

951
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,760
how the waitlist works

952
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,840
yeah so the wait list um

953
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
in the beginning it was uh it was pretty

954
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,919
much you could get

955
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,840
any size block off it that you could

956
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,159
qualify for under policy so

957
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
in the first couple years of the wait

958
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,159
list we did have several slash 16s

959
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,840
that were filled and even a 15.

960
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,880
we found some fraudulent activity

961
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,600
because there was a 12 month hold on you

962
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
couldn't you couldn't transfer you

963
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,640
couldn't get it off the waitlist and

964
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,960
then you had to hold it for a year uh we

965
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,560
found um

966
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,520
most of the big blocks were sold exactly

967
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,079
12 and a half months after they got them

968
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
off the wait list so the board put a put

969
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,679
a hold on it and redid it and so now

970
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,119
today the uh

971
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,480
you cannot have more than a slash

972
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,719
well you can have a slash 20

973
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
plus a little bit

974
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,679
more like a 24 or 22

975
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,359
but if you have more than a slash 20 you

976
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,480
can't apply you can only receive up to a

977
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,159
slash 22

978
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,599
at a time

979
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,719
and

980
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,760
you have to wait 90 days after

981
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,000
your first fulfillment to go back to put

982
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,879
in another application so it ends up we

983
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,280
we do our distributions quarterly so it

984
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
ends up you can you if you don't have

985
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,399
any space and you start out you could

986
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,839
get a 22

987
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,160
sit out a quarter and be back on the

988
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,200
list and get a 22. however we're running

989
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
very very

990
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,960
low on inventory

991
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,040
that we have gotten in and cleaned up

992
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,320
for the wait list

993
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,240
and um

994
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
i believe we're almost up to 500 on the

995
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,400
waitlist now and on the last

996
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,320
distribution we only

997
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
filled like 50 organizations out of 200

998
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,520
plus that were on the wait list up to

999
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
that time for the last two years we had

1000
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,760
been completely

1001
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
filling every request each quarter but

1002
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,119
that has stopped and it's not gonna it's

1003
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,280
not gonna pick up again it's there's no

1004
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,800
more we're really

1005
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,200
um out there there is um a few

1006
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,240
larger

1007
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,960
blocks that will clean up over

1008
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,119
the next six months

1009
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,119
to a year and

1010
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,960
um but it's not going to be enough to

1011
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,440
ever completely fulfill that wait list

1012
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,119
that one

1013
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,440
distribution so

1014
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,560
it's still a viable solution but only if

1015
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,960
you uh can wait

1016
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
a longer period

1017
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,599
all right cool

1018
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,440
um let's go through and just give

1019
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,920
everyone one last chance do you think

1020
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,560
that there what's what sort of advice do

1021
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,480
do you have for anyone thinking of

1022
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,000
participating in the market that maybe

1023
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,040
we haven't haven't touched on here um

1024
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,200
let's start with chris

1025
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,160
uh

1026
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,480
i think we've covered almost all

1027
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,680
i didn't jump in before but i would just

1028
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,599
say my advice would be if you're an

1029
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,040
enterprise or a big company that's

1030
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,160
selling

1031
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,040
um

1032
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,240
you saw everybody kind of chuckling

1033
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,280
about the transaction times because

1034
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,800
they've been all over the place

1035
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,160
don't underestimate how long it's going

1036
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,280
to take you to convince everybody in

1037
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
your own company to do it first in my

1038
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,560
experience that's been longer than any

1039
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,240
of the external transactions everybody

1040
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,839
in this room knows how to do it no one

1041
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,079
in your company does uh so give yourself

1042
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,040
a lot of time energy and effort to to

1043
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,960
give that to transactions to happen and

1044
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,560
then the rest will kind of come easier

1045
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,359
would be my two sense of advice

1046
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,760
um yeah i would go with um a trusted and

1047
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,040
who you're dealing with is really

1048
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,200
important in this if you don't know your

1049
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
buyer you're not doing if you're doing a

1050
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,280
direct deal with an entity that you have

1051
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
a long-standing business relationship

1052
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,599
with that's very low risk if you're

1053
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,440
going out and selling to

1054
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,160
somebody that you've you have no ties to

1055
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,880
that the risk goes up

1056
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,839
protect your organization use escrow if

1057
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,079
you're in those kind of situations

1058
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:24,960
um

1059
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,480
once you update your file at aaron and

1060
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,000
people see the name changes start to

1061
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,680
come through and all that

1062
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,760
there's a number of brokers that are

1063
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,160
watching those transactions or or i

1064
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,480
should say individuals

1065
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,960
wanting to be brokers that are watching

1066
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,710
those

1067
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,599
[Laughter]

1068
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,440
those transactions and um they

1069
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,040
will then

1070
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,000
um contact you a lot if they're not

1071
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,119
already

1072
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,079
and

1073
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,000
you've you've just put a sign on your

1074
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
door like saying i i'm ready i'm selling

1075
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,079
um

1076
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,079
and they will come up with some really

1077
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,920
interesting stories to get you to talk

1078
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,359
to them

1079
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,839
as with any business you would do get a

1080
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,839
referral find out who they've worked

1081
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,040
with

1082
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,880
i'm not here to say who's good and who's

1083
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,920
bad but there's only a handful we do

1084
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,000
business with in general we're dealing

1085
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,240
with bigger blocks that puts us into a

1086
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,800
different category um

1087
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,760
but get a referral don't just say oh

1088
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,200
they told me they could get the highest

1089
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,440
price so i'm going to work with them

1090
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,119
because

1091
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,440
it it's yeah there's a lot of often

1092
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,680
times they can't oh and one other pet

1093
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,520
peeve of mine i will i will pick on

1094
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,599
aaron a little bit um

1095
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,320
so

1096
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,119
there are every registry has a list of

1097
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,720
um ip address facilitators

1098
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,040
these are not endorsed by the registry

1099
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,280
there's no such thing as an aaron

1100
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,800
endorsed

1101
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,680
facilitator a ripe endorsed facilitator

1102
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,599
they have a signed an agreement and

1103
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,280
they've paid a fee to be on the list

1104
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,560
that's all

1105
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,800
so be careful with those lists don't

1106
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,359
take those as a referral those aren't

1107
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,440
it's not yelp of brokers or something

1108
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,560
it's

1109
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,800
it's just it's a service that we offer

1110
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200
to the community to list facilitators

1111
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
that want to be listed correct and

1112
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
that's all it is it's just a list of

1113
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,079
possible facilitators you can contact

1114
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,040
but as tina said they come in all shapes

1115
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,960
and sizes and you

1116
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,680
really need to get a referral we can't

1117
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,200
refer we can't refer any facilitators we

1118
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,040
don't and we won't

1119
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,760
we

1120
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
can give you

1121
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
names of organizations that have

1122
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,320
completed transfers you but you can

1123
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,800
really find that as well but that's as

1124
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,560
much as we can do we we won't even

1125
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,280
discuss facilitators with anyone just

1126
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,119
ask around i've been i've inherited

1127
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,960
transactions that were underway and

1128
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,200
there's a re even as a seller there's a

1129
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,560
really big difference between a good

1130
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,720
broker and a bad broker like even after

1131
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
the deal is done in the price is set

1132
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,079
there's a really big difference yeah

1133
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,839
billy would you like to

1134
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,119
respond

1135
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,079
i would say right now there's um

1136
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,440
there's definitely constraints going on

1137
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,400
the marketplace

1138
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,760
um so plan early and plan often

1139
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,960
don't wait or delay

1140
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,640
in the sense that

1141
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,040
too often people show up and say hi i've

1142
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
got a little bit of budget

1143
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,119
i'd like to buy some space

1144
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,520
oh by the way i need to have it done by

1145
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,359
december 31st

1146
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,319
which is

1147
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,040
four days away

1148
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,280
those types of things are unrealistic to

1149
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,720
the extent

1150
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,800
many organizations

1151
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,920
are struggling to spend the time on a

1152
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,160
lot of their long-term planning

1153
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,680
especially when everyone started using

1154
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,359
the internet more during covid there

1155
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,240
were some organizations that were caught

1156
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,599
seeing an increase in traffic that was

1157
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,720
unexpected

1158
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,880
and that put them into crisis mode and

1159
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,800
so just by staying ahead

1160
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,119
of everything and always be looking at

1161
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,839
that sort of capacity issue

1162
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,079
and plan early because

1163
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,920
you may not be able to find what you're

1164
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,960
looking for in a short time frame

1165
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,680
across the board

1166
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,280
all right why don't we uh open this up

1167
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,000
to some questions from

1168
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,280
all of y'all

1169
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,960
i think marlene's going to come up in

1170
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,599
well here's your chance to ask these

1171
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,359
there's no questions it's good really

1172
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,520
easy topics there's no questions at all

1173
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,200
so from the online audience in the q and

1174
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,200
a forum we have a question from

1175
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,920
carl morin aren't organizations forced

1176
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,119
to return unused ips by errand policies

1177
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,520
looking at legacy allocations to public

1178
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,319
entities i think that's a

1179
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,319
question i'm sorry i didn't that

1180
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,040
sure um aren't questions forced to

1181
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,160
return unused ips by errand policies is

1182
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,319
the question no

1183
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,920
absolutely not

1184
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,640
we we act we will allow you to return

1185
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,920
space but we even

1186
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,839
have a requirement that

1187
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,880
your ceo or ceo a c-level officer signs

1188
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,200
and notarizes an affidavit saying that

1189
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,480
they know what they're doing and they

1190
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,640
want to return the space they don't wish

1191
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,960
to participate in the transfer market

1192
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,760
and they want to return that space

1193
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,839
without it we won't even take space back

1194
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,240
from you

1195
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
okay we seem to not have any questions

1196
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,480
from the live audience yet um that's one

1197
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,880
in the back

1198
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,079
hi

1199
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,240
i'm asking where do you see the

1200
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,079
industry sorry could you state your name

1201
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,040
and affiliation please

1202
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,359
uh i'm asking where do you see the

1203
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,119
industry in five years where do you see

1204
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:05,920
uh

1205
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,280
the market

1206
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,240
going in five years from now

1207
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,000
[Laughter]

1208
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,920
no patrick yeah

1209
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,520
yeah we all hope

1210
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,160
but we have a little bit of time here uh

1211
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
you did the three if you want to go

1212
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,960
do we all want to take a stab at that

1213
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,640
i'm not qualified all right billy what

1214
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,720
do you think what market in five years

1215
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,440
so the the market in five years

1216
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,960
uh what you're finding is uh over time

1217
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,920
prices will increase but only to a point

1218
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,520
at some point technology will have to

1219
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,200
replace that um

1220
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,720
many have hypothesized that's going to

1221
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,440
force uh the move to v6

1222
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
i would argue that v4 is going to

1223
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,920
continue to grow as organizations

1224
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,240
supporting v4 v6 will be on its own

1225
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,960
trajectory as we've already seen

1226
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,800
but what you're seeing right now is that

1227
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,920
once a block transfers that block

1228
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,800
isn't typically going to transfer again

1229
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,520
right

1230
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,359
what we may find is that in the future

1231
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,599
as people are migrating to v6

1232
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,680
certain elements of v4 will be available

1233
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,520
and that will continue to provide

1234
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,800
additional

1235
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,160
inventory for organizations who aren't

1236
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,720
able to turn off or shut down their v4

1237
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,160
networks

1238
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,520
and just to build on that i think

1239
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,680
there's a great effort to

1240
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,880
find efficiencies for v4 in your network

1241
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,240
and use v6 wherever you can to grow

1242
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,839
and i think we'll see more and more of

1243
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,200
that where organizations aren't

1244
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,680
necessarily obtaining additional space

1245
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,359
they're learning to use what they have

1246
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,359
better and exactly where they have to

1247
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,520
have v4 i think both will run in

1248
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,240
parallel for quite a while and v4 will

1249
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,079
will probably maintain value for quite a

1250
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,480
while but there will be a point that

1251
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,440
organizations stop acquiring space i

1252
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,880
would expect

1253
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,599
printers usually can run on rfc 1918

1254
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,119
space or net 10 or

1255
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,800
192.168. so something to look into if

1256
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,960
you're not doing that already

1257
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,359
hard-coded mainframes are another story

1258
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,760
very true

1259
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,000
uh we have a comment from the uh q a

1260
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,520
portion um asking well stating that from

1261
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,720
dan magorian not like mit and stanford

1262
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,760
sitting on slash aids that that had to

1263
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,280
get done

1264
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,119
i'm not really sure

1265
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,079
what

1266
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,680
he wanted to

1267
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,040
make a point make my point

1268
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,880
um from the live audience

1269
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,319
omar akan toy um i am from aws i have a

1270
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,760
question um

1271
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,240
so amy you touched on bad actors and

1272
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,400
inflating of the marketplace uh do you

1273
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,319
mind elaborating on what a bad actor

1274
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,599
looks like or inflating the marketplace

1275
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,480
uh sure i can elaborate on that so there

1276
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,430
are

1277
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,920
[Music]

1278
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,599
these these addresses have value and

1279
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,480
there are people out there that will try

1280
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,119
and extract some of some of that value

1281
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,200
some sometimes it can be

1282
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,440
an organization

1283
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,920
that or an individual even

1284
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,119
they'll look up some stale space and in

1285
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,119
the rir's that haven't been touched for

1286
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,800
a long time the point of contact haven't

1287
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,480
been updated

1288
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,160
and they will try to

1289
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,760
either pretend to be a broker

1290
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,000
representing that space and and we'll

1291
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,920
try and sell that to someone when they

1292
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,240
have absolutely no rights to do that

1293
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,520
sometimes there have been orgs that have

1294
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,440
started up a new company in the name of

1295
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,760
an an old company that space is

1296
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,200
registered to try and pretend that

1297
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,480
they're the same

1298
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,920
organization

1299
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,119
um all all sorts of creative waves

1300
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,280
people have have found to

1301
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,800
try to sell something that was not there

1302
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,000
to sell

1303
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,319
if yeah if a facilitator asks you to pay

1304
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,119
them

1305
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,119
not and have no relationship whatsoever

1306
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,839
with the seller

1307
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,240
run run

1308
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,599
anytime there's a lot of money involved

1309
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,800
that was actually one thing that came up

1310
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,920
before

1311
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,599
to i would also recommend even if you're

1312
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,280
not in the market of buying and selling

1313
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,359
to the extent that any of your companies

1314
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,880
are doing m a

1315
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,960
you should really stick your nose in it

1316
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,400
because typically the lawyers and the

1317
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,640
other folks doing m a don't understand

1318
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,040
the subject matter and i i've actually

1319
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,960
been on the side of it where someone

1320
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,800
accidentally sells a block

1321
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,440
or

1322
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,680
words something in such a way

1323
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,800
that they don't even realize they're

1324
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,200
doing and the block tran and then the

1325
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,200
other the recipient who maybe does and

1326
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,800
maybe is a little bit bad acting

1327
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,319
suddenly tries to claim rights and next

1328
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,599
thing you know you're in a legal fight

1329
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,960
so even if you're not planning or buying

1330
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,400
or selling

1331
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,520
i would just recommend you have a

1332
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,960
responsibility to your company if you

1333
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,800
know about mna going on that in any way

1334
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,559
involves an i.t system you should just

1335
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,000
stick your nose in it as someone who

1336
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,359
knows the space and understands what's

1337
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,119
going on to help protect your own

1338
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,559
company and make sure you don't

1339
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,119
accidentally do something that your

1340
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,559
organization will regret years later

1341
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,720
because i've seen it happen

1342
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,559
yeah i i just like to have one thing

1343
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,359
from their point of view um there was a

1344
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,040
time when you could

1345
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,480
uh

1346
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,359
reclaim your poc by having an email sent

1347
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,480
to the email address of the poc

1348
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,440
and a lot of as amy was saying a lot of

1349
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,720
people

1350
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,440
found domains that were gone

1351
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,760
and address space that wasn't being used

1352
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,160
and they registered the domain name

1353
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
and they set up a mailbox and they

1354
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,559
reclaimed those pocks

1355
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,520
and they've been using that space for a

1356
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,850
while

1357
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:31,920
[Music]

1358
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,720
they

1359
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,400
come in and they now are trying to

1360
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,760
transfer we

1361
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,559
we catch that um

1362
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,240
because there's a lot a lot more

1363
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,240
requirements for transferring the space

1364
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,640
than than just claiming it but there was

1365
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,359
a time when uh if you were in the if you

1366
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,520
were going to be in the spamming

1367
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,520
business you needed a whole lot of

1368
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,119
address space and you would do anything

1369
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,440
you could to find it so yeah

1370
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,720
there's a there's a book here clearly

1371
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,000
waiting to be ran

1372
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,119
and this shouldn't be turning into a

1373
00:48:59,119 --> 00:48:59,600
how-to

1374
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,200
[Laughter]

1375
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,960
yeah so fun tip if you're afraid that

1376
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,559
someone is trying to sell you space

1377
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,319
under that circumstance you can compare

1378
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,240
the date that that company was started

1379
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,240
to the date that they received the

1380
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,040
addresses with the rir the company

1381
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,040
should have existed before they

1382
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,960
and and fun thing if you come across one

1383
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,960
of these individuals you can report them

1384
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,440
to aaron yes you can and they can take

1385
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,920
some action

1386
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,839
i think there's one of them

1387
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,280
we do have a question from the

1388
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,280
online audience as well

1389
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,240
um hi from this is from cyril lavier

1390
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,480
hi has the ip market changed since the

1391
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,319
recent events in ukraine started

1392
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,440
i i haven't seen any substantial change

1393
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:45,770
um

1394
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:46,880
[Music]

1395
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,839
in the north american market and

1396
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,839
we've yeah i haven't seen a real

1397
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,319
substantial change from that

1398
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,319
there's a little interesting change we

1399
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,960
just noticed in in the past

1400
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,440
two quarters um

1401
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,839
for for the first four years or so of

1402
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,000
enter our air transfers

1403
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,800
a lot more space was going out of the

1404
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,960
aran region into the ripe in the ap neck

1405
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,800
region

1406
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,359
we think that was due to we had so much

1407
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,559
legacy space that wasn't being used and

1408
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,440
those people rushed to go ahead and fill

1409
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,960
the the market in all three rirs aaron

1410
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,839
ripe and ap neck and it's that low

1411
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,480
hanging fruit is drying up in the aaron

1412
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,440
region

1413
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,359
um so

1414
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,599
but the bigger companies in the iron

1415
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,440
region that are still needing space they

1416
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,680
are going out to the other regions and

1417
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,160
transferring in large blocks last

1418
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,480
quarter we had a 14

1419
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,160
uh 14 and 5 16s come into the iron

1420
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,720
region and we had never had a quarter

1421
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,119
where we had more than like a total of a

1422
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,599
slash 16 coming in from enter our ir

1423
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,520
transfer so i have noticed we have

1424
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,000
noticed that change in trend um in the

1425
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,440
market

1426
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,559
i would say the only thing that we've

1427
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,680
noticed is um on the sanctioned front is

1428
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,359
just have to be diligent about the

1429
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,440
organizations that you're working with

1430
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,880
especially when it comes to do not trade

1431
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,040
lists foreign practice

1432
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,720
there are folks

1433
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,720
out there in the world that will try to

1434
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,160
represent that

1435
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,839
they're legal for north american

1436
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,280
companies to do business with when in

1437
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,280
fact they're they're representing one of

1438
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,880
these sanctioned entities and you need

1439
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,720
to be very careful on that front

1440
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,839
um

1441
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,520
state your name and affiliation please

1442
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,720
sure dan mahoney ise um wondering if

1443
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,960
you've seen any sort of market for

1444
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,359
leasing ip addresses uh for a couple

1445
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,119
years for organizations that don't want

1446
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,880
to lose their permanent thing

1447
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,559
tina do you want to address that

1448
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,359
i've been known to rant about leasing um

1449
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,319
so leasing to me is is a bit flawed um

1450
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,839
if you're leasing to your customers

1451
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,920
again the relationship matters the trust

1452
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,440
matters if you're leasing to your

1453
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,559
customers that's that's a choice that's

1454
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,400
you know a pro that can be a good

1455
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,599
business model

1456
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,000
um leasing in general

1457
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,880
most

1458
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,640
organizations that are trying to lease

1459
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,720
their space want to hold on to it until

1460
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,280
ipv4 hits peak price so they can sell it

1461
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,240
then and make money until then

1462
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,559
that's a really big gamble

1463
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,880
any legitimate user is going to lease

1464
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,040
the space for five to ten years and you

1465
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,520
may miss the bubble altogether to sell

1466
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,800
the space

1467
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,520
um and any organization that's willing

1468
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,000
to go month to month or year to year

1469
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,800
and i am being very general right now um

1470
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,640
but oftentimes

1471
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,319
there's a reason for that they are spam

1472
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,440
operators they're doing something

1473
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,640
nefarious

1474
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,920
and that block will then be tainted by

1475
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,000
the the usage being used for that and

1476
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,880
the whole block including your services

1477
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,240
that you're running on the other part of

1478
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,280
that aggregate can now be on block lists

1479
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,440
and experience issues

1480
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,760
so my advice to anybody that wants to go

1481
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,680
down that road is definitely split

1482
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,480
anything you're going to list into a org

1483
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,400
that's completely separate from your

1484
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,839
primary business

1485
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,640
so that if it does impact you don't feel

1486
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,000
it and your customers don't go down

1487
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,760
thank you i have one other minor

1488
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,160
cautionary tale

1489
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,240
if you're doing

1490
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,280
dns sec on your ipa addresses

1491
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,440
aaron has a little bit of a flaw where

1492
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,000
they will split your slash 16 into a

1493
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,440
slash 17

1494
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,040
and assign your ds record all the way

1495
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,720
down to all your individual slash 24s um

1496
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,079
that really needs to be fixed

1497
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,640
ask me how i know

1498
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,800

revocation discussions happening in the

1501
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,200
afrinic region and how that might be

1502
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,799
impacting the transfer market globally

1503
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,599
the aphronic region

1504
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,880
the the

1505
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,520
what's going on in afrodink

1506
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,000

1509
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,680
um

1510
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,640
okay so here was the full uh comments

1511
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,599
last question from dan mcgorian

1512
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,240
we have a sick uh we have a slash 16

1513
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,319
that could not be that could be resolved

1514
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,839
due to gnat leaving a bunch of 24's and

1515
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,200
19 of four remaining apps

1516
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,040
need real

1517
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,319
addresses

1518
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,319
the problems are huge amount of

1519
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,559
thankless work working with internal

1520
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,280
users find all the legacy apps still

1521
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,400
using it

1522
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
some of which source code is lost and

1523
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,880
having started that any problems that

1524
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,599
happen are your fault when

1525
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,640
break old boxes cranking away in corner

1526
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,960
that no one owns anymore the second

1527
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,960
problem is the network and application

1528
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,359
folks that do all the work with users

1529
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,200
don't even necessarily get the money

1530
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,440
from reselling addresses

1531
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,440
the cio would take the money and give it

1532
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,599
to some other project not like mit and

1533
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,000
stanford sitting on slash aids that had

1534
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,319
to get done

1535
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,400
not sure

1536
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,799
well i'll start with um the

1537
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,440
couple problems there for one um your

1538
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,480
your network when you're waiting um

1539
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,000
you're afraid to touch your network for

1540
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,839
fear of breaking it

1541
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,000
you're not a confident network operator

1542
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,920
right like this is an opportunity to

1543
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,960
really go and clean up your network and

1544
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,400
you know this is

1545
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,280
this is an opportunity of a huge

1546
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,319
magnitude um the second half we we do

1547
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,720
see this a lot especially on purchasing

1548
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,359
space where um the people that have to

1549
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,799
do the work to

1550
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,079
um free up ips then it don't benefit at

1551
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,640
all from from the work the money goes

1552
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,119
into a larger pot they get nothing they

1553
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,880
don't get their projects funded they're

1554
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,920
still um you know struggling

1555
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,720
uh

1556
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
one of the things you can facilitate

1557
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,040
when you do a

1558
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,960
some of these transactions i won't even

1559
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,119
say it has to be direct because a good

1560
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,280
facilitator can make this happen as well

1561
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,119
is figure out a way to get some of the

1562
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,000
funds directed into your projects

1563
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,520
so one option we we've talked about is

1564
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,520
you know paying a third party that can

1565
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,359
broker equipment and contracting

1566
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,680
services and things like that out of the

1567
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,160
fee right off the top that we're paying

1568
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,119
for the addresses and then the remainder

1569
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,880
after your project's done goes into the

1570
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,240
big pot so get creative with your deals

1571
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,640
yeah i would just add obviously listen

1572
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,400
my opinion is biased because in that

1573
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,160
example i am the cio right i'm the

1574
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,440
person he's complaining about not

1575
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,960
specifically but

1576
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,559
um

1577
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,160
i'll just be very blunt and i've

1578
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,000
listened i've been a hands-on network

1579
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,920
operator and i've been a cio you know

1580
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,920
what solves every one of those problems

1581
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,240
cash

1582
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,319
it does it's just i mean let's not beat

1583
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,079
around the bush okay so we're all pissed

1584
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,359
off because we have to work harder

1585
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,839
because our company got a check well at

1586
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:12,799
the risk of sounding like the

1587
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,480
capitalistic cio that's why we all get a

1588
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,520
paycheck

1589
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,680
um so i think the

1590
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,400
but

1591
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,160
if i'm on a more constructive ben to

1592
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,000
answer that question is that's why you

1593
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,280
got to get in front of it don't let it

1594
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,880
happen to you

1595
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,200
don't let don't let a broker call a

1596
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,559
board member and convince them that they

1597
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,079
have an asset before you're involved in

1598
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,319
the conversation if you have it

1599
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,559
recognize it and bring it forward and

1600
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,920
suddenly you're not the person who's not

1601
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,119
getting funding you're the person

1602
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,559
showing up with a check

1603
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,680
and those are two very different

1604
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,520
conversations internally so take some

1605
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,559
agency

1606
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,920
be aggressive

1607
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,680
no one in your company outside of people

1608
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,799
in this room or some of the smartest

1609
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,160
network operators in the world know how

1610
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,680
this stuff works so take it to them

1611
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,440
before someone else does and then all

1612
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,200
those problems go away

1613
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,960
absolutely

1614
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,000
great

1615
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,680
state your name and affiliation please

1616
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,799
hey uh i'm brian fields uh i'm worth

1617
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,680
nokia but uh

1618
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,920
i really have kind of two things i'll

1619
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,960
touch on

1620
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,040
um one you had said leasing was kind of

1621
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,759
a bad idea

1622
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,079
if the opportunity comes up and you're

1623
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,480
familiar with the person leasing

1624
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,960
um i i found it's it's actually works

1625
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,440
out pretty well but you have to know

1626
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,319
the person doing the leasing uh it's

1627
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,480
it's how i've taken my my little bit of

1628
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,559
ip space that i have personally and i

1629
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:29,839
don't have to pay the errand bill

1630
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,960
anymore and get a little bit of money

1631
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,200
out of it and get to still use most of

1632
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,319
it

1633
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,200
um the second question i have

1634
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,160
and maybe off topic from what you guys

1635
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,680
deal with but

1636
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,440
for organizations now that have ipspace

1637
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,319
and now somebody technical is coming to

1638
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,839
the various c-level executives and

1639
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,520
saying hey we have this ip space we can

1640
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,280
sell it we can make money

1641
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,920
um and maybe you can answer

1642
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,839
once you guys do have this space

1643
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,200
internally

1644
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,240
is that then something like that

1645
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,480
your accounting guys have to track as an

1646
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,040
asset and and all that

1647
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,720
how does that work i'm curious if you

1648
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,040
guys have have dealt with that as a

1649
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,640
problem

1650
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,599
um the the v4 or was that for the v6

1651
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,720
tracking or well for

1652
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,119
well not even that it's just your

1653
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,119
organization has v4 space and

1654
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,119
does do you now find yourselves having

1655
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,880
to like track that as an asset on the

1656
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,520
books now yes okay very much so it's

1657
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,000
amateurized just like any hardware or

1658
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,079
anything you would buy

1659
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,079
and one comment response to your lease

1660
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,480
um question i agree if you if you have a

1661
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,400
relationship it can be a very mutually

1662
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,160
beneficial situation um but one caution

1663
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,240
i was approaching it as somebody that

1664
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,119
was

1665
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,760
providing the space to to lease out if

1666
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,920
you're leasing space you are also at

1667
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,200
risk if you don't have a trust

1668
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,400
relationship

1669
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,880
because the per the organization that

1670
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,799
owns the space could decide to sell it

1671
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,720
at any moment and

1672
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,400
if they have no other assets if

1673
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,160
somebody's just holding a block and they

1674
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,839
have no other assets and they chose to

1675
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,319
sell it you you have no say all of a

1676
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,240
sudden your networks could be off so

1677
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,640
trust trust trust is super important

1678
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,880
yeah what i was saying regarding leasing

1679
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,760
was like i have a block from aaron yeah

1680
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,599
i pay the errand fees we paid the earned

1681
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,920
fees and i basically use it for messing

1682
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,200
around a little bit of colo here and

1683
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,720
there kind of stuff

1684
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,599
and

1685
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,599
through some serendipitous thing i was

1686
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,200
able to help somebody and

1687
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,720
get them online they said we'd like to

1688
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,760
like please

1689
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,400
24 from you i did a little agreement

1690
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,599
with them and

1691
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,359
now my errand fees get paid by somebody

1692
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,599
else so working out very nicely nice

1693
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,440
great i'd just like to point out that at

1694
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,280
aaron now be with the fee harmonization

1695
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,720
at the beginning of the year all are

1696
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,359
blocked everything is an allocation so

1697
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,599
even former end users that are now

1698
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,640
service members cannot can actually do

1699
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,400
reassignments in the database so if

1700
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,079
you're leasing it to somebody and you

1701
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,240
want to to show

1702
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,640
that that's who's using that space you

1703
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,400
can reassign it in their data and it'll

1704
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,079
show up in who is and you want to do

1705
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,319
that for legal warrants and

1706
