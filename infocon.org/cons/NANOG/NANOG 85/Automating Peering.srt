excited to be in person um i said we're

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
going to talk a little bit about some of

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
the work we've been doing in meta and

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
really trying to talk about um

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,079
automating that app here in that mailbox

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,600
and really the streamlining we've been

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
doing about that

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
if i make the clicker work so talking

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,360
about the problem we're trying to solve

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,239
here

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,920
you know we operate a large cdn we

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,239
operate a large network connected to

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,320
multiple ixes globally you can see some

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,239
of the stats on the screen here um so

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,880
we're connected to an excess of 210

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,799
internet exchanges globally and being

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,240
connected to a lot of internet exchanges

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
and being in a lucky position that

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,200
people really want to pair with us to

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
get their cat pictures that means we get

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
lots of requests for peering so you can

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,520
see that from the stats we get about 500

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
emails per month to our peer-in-app

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
mailbox and of that about 100 plus of

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,640
those emails are genuine pm requests we

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,040
need to handle you know lots of ixes i

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
said lots of peering that means in

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,680
excess of 44 000 public peering sessions

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,439
we've got configured globally and that

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,560
keeps rising

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
looking at the trend of requests you

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,000
know it's not one off um you can see

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,479
here two lines the blue line shows total

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,240
emails received monthly month and this

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,479
is a couple of years worth of data and

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,840
the kind of uh other line

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,920
shows um the number of valid peering

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,759
requests you we need to handle so you

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,280
can see there's a few peaks and troughs

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
in these graphs um that could be

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,240
holiday freezes change freezes but also

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,399
you know when we connect on uix and we

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,920
you know announce that that generates a

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,840
lot of inbound requests being seen the

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
pattern is pretty consistent of you know

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,480
150 valid requests per month

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,239
you know what we're trying to do you

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,440
know i've said it already we're trying

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
to have a streamlined experience here we

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,520
want to make it easy for our peers to

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,599
request public peering see the status of

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,959
their public peering and really manage

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,200
that one of our things is move fast and

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,480
we want our peers to be able to move

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
fast with us as well

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,200
so jenny what did we do

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,239
thank you ben so

72
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,239
we automated it so we made it so that

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,519
the handling of the peering at fb.com

74
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
mailing list um could be handled

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
automatically so let's go through how it

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
works

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,599
so

78
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,879
you may be familiar with our

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
facebook.com peering page if you haven't

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,959
you know at the top we've got our

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,879
peering policy we've got some technical

82
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,120
requirements and then at the bottom

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
we've now added a button which says

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,440
request public peering now before i go

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,519
into that i want to point out

86
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
if you look in the upper right

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,879
you'll see that you don't have to be

88
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,560
logged into facebook in order to view

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,040
the page so

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
we've heard

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,519
no one wants to use their personal

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,599
facebook for their work experience and

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,239
so you can stay logged out and still go

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,080
to the button below so let's say you

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
click the button

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
again we're doing screenshots not a live

97
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,280
demo so

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,040
if you request public peering this is

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
still on the facebook.com page you'll be

100
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,319
redirected to peeringdb so we've set up

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,239
peeringdb oauth

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,159
as the

103
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,560
login provider for our peering requests

104
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,319
all of our peers have a peering db

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,159
account and so it's very easy to use

106
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,920
that to decide

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,879
what

108
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,480
networks you should be allowed to

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
transact on or not transact on so if you

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,040
log in here

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
you'll get this pop-up which says

112
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
authorizes us basically to collect

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,480
what networks you manage and then your

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,200
email address so we can

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
send you our automated communications

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
telling you about your session status as

117
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,319
they come up

118
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
so you authorize

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,519
and you'll be redirected back to the

120
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,000
facebook.com page so this is the logged

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,279
in view again logged in with peering dbo

122
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,759
you can see you've got your as number

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,600
you've got your email address this is

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
the one on peeringdb by default so if

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
you'd like it to be something else you

126
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,560
can change it and we'll send our

127
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
messages to that instead

128
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,479
and then down below you can see all of

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,720
the sessions both that if you have

130
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,080
sessions with us

131
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,000
you'll see the statuses there but if you

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
don't

133
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
you'll see them pre-selected so you can

134
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
just click right through and say yes i'd

135
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
like to appear at all of these locations

136
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,520
and then you can request public peering

137
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,680
so let's see the zoomed in view if you

138
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,320
expand an exchange you'll see that you

139
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
can see the session status for each

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
individual session by ippair so

141
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
while you're waiting for your sessions

142
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
to be configured you can come back and

143
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
check to see how it's going

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,919
so let's say let's say that you

145
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,160
request public peering after that point

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
your request will land in our approval

147
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,600
queue where

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
we'll do some analysis to decide and

149
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
then configure the peering

150
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,919
so

151
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,360
that was public appearing that's

152
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,800
available now

153
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
you get to see the sneak preview

154
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
for private peering which we're going to

155
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,120
be releasing again on facebook.com

156
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,039
peering very soon so i'll walk you

157
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,039
through what that's going to look like

158
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,639
it's the same as public peering except

159
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,199
you'll see here you can pick your which

160
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,360
uh connections you'd like to set up this

161
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,759
is the adding a new one version

162
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,520
if you just like to augment an existing

163
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
private peering link again we'll offer

164
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,639
that as well

165
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,000
and again

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
once you click the blue button at the

167
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,360
bottom that'll land in our approval

168
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
queue and we will start configuring that

169
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,000
so this is in testing mode now we'd love

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,919
for interested parties to come talk to

171
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,240
us after if you'd be interested in beta

172
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
testing it with us because we need

173
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,479
people to try it out so please do let

174
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,840
either of us or anyone from meta know

175
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
thanks so like we said in the beginning

176
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,680
this is all to replace peering at fb.com

177
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
so what happens if you email it today

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
well you get the following message so it

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
says

180
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,080
thank you for your interest in peering

181
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160
with meta and it points you back to our

182
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
facebook.com peering page so this is

183
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,360
very useful for us because it reduces

184
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
the load on our on-call which allows the

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
appearing on call to work on other more

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,080
impactful projects and also makes it

187
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
easier for you as peers because now you

188
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
have a self-service way to configure the

189
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
sessions at your convenience and then

190
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,319
monitor their status again at your

191
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,080
convenience without needing to contact

192
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,240
us to ask so hopefully it's better for

193
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,080
everyone

194
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,759
so i've touched on this before but let's

195
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,080
go through the step-by-step flow for

196
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
what happens when you try this out

197
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,360
so first off

198
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,280
we've got the option if you email

199
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,319
peering at fb.com you'll get the

200
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,639
email categorizer i will auto reply so

201
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,160
let me touch on that right we don't just

202
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,199
reply to

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,120
every request that comes into peering at

204
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,720
fb.com because

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
some of them may not be peering requests

206
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,919
right so we have a service that goes

207
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,680
through and categorizes

208
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,000
public peering request private peering

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,880
request

210
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,639
other kind of request

211
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,960
mailing list and for anything deemed a

212
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
public peering and soon private peering

213
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
we'll reply back with a please go to

214
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,120
facebook.com peering

215
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
so let's say

216
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,120
you've emailed or you know you went

217
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,599
through straight to facebook.com peering

218
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,120
either way you're going to hit the oauth

219
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
right so you'll log in you'll get

220
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,879
redirected and then you'll come back

221
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,479
with the token and we'll show you the

222
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,840
logged in view

223
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
or you know if you're a peer who's on

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,240
the sorry the network partner portal you

225
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,759
can also just go to the form directly

226
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,599
there but either way let's say you've

227
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,560
submitted something in the form

228
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,479
afterwards it'll land in our internal

229
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,360
queue this is just so we can review the

230
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,280
incoming requests to make sure that they

231
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,599
meet our peering policy and we have a

232
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,520
service which goes through and issues a

233
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,919
suggestion for each request you know

234
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,759
should we approve this should we not and

235
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,599
then sometimes you're automatically

236
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,039
approved and sometimes a human will

237
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,199
review it either way

238
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,120
once that's done we'll start our

239
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,759
automated peering configuration project

240
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,560
so

241
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,319
we have a workflow that will go and set

242
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,840
the sessions up with no human

243
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
intervention required and then also

244
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
send you automated

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,080
communications so you know hey we've

246
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
configured our side of the stuff you

247
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,839
need to configure your side okay we've

248
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,519
detected that everything is configured

249
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
thank you for appearing with us so again

250
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,480
that's all automatic now

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
next slide so

252
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
since we launched this in

253
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,839
april of last year

254
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,440
how's it worked right

255
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
so

256
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,480
we've gotten about 5 000 emails

257
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,200
out of those emails we've gotten 1526

258
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
automatic requests

259
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,279
through our automated services and then

260
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,560
of those we've approved

261
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,560
1525 of them so a lot and this has saved

262
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
us a lot of time because as you can see

263
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,279
we've configured over 17 000 sessions

264
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,240
automatically so that's

265
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,359
i don't remember

266
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,920
so he configured him automatically which

267
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,640
has saved us a ton of time

268
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
all right so there were a number of

269
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
considerations we had when we were

270
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,360
setting this up right first off we

271
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,800
wanted to have some kind of queuing

272
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,640
system this was so that we could be

273
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,440
confident that our services were doing

274
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
what we expected you know we wanted to

275
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
make sure we were acting correctly

276
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
gradually we've been moving to more

277
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,839
automated approvals as we get more

278
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,760
confident in our system

279
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,839
secondly as you'll see if you go to the

280
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,000
page we've taken a reliance on peering

281
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
tv oauth is that okay well actually we

282
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,800
already required that all of our peers

283
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
have peering db oauth

284
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,800
before we started this so we decided

285
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
that was fine

286
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
and then finally as i said before right

287
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
we wanted to make sure you could hit the

288
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,079
page without having a facebook account

289
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,079
we've heard that you know personal

290
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,000
facebook for work is maybe not what you

291
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,720
want so now you can get to the page

292
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,519
while you're logged out

293
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,839
so we'd love to see this as the sort of

294
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,519
the industry standard and we'd love to

295
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
see you try it out so please please go

296
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
to our page and check it out if you go

297
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
you can see all of your bgp sessions in

298
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,920
one place you can easily configure new

299
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,440
bgp sessions

300
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
everyone has a peering db account so

301
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
hopefully you can use it and then you

302
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
know i know we're lucky than that we

303
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
have a whole department basically

304
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
devoted to setting this kind of thing up

305
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,839
but if you're interested in doing it for

306
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
your own network as well

307
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
the peering db oauth was easy to

308
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
implement it took us about a day to set

309
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
the whole thing up

310
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
other people are using it as well you

311
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
know ixp manager peering manager also

312
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,839
using the oauth and with all of this the

313
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,760
automation is saving us and hopefully

314
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
you a lot of time

315
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
so if you are interested

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,040
yes

317
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,959
um these are the components that you

318
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,959
would need to do this yourself right

319
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,120
you'll need some tool that will generate

320
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
per peer configs for your routers

321
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,000
there's some open source ones for this

322
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
you need the automation to actually push

323
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
the config

324
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,959
again so that a human doesn't have to do

325
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,560
it and then finally you're also going to

326
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
need some kind of system to monitor your

327
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,680
session status so you can tell your

328
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
partners whether or not the session is

329
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,360
up

330
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
and you'll need some kind of engine to

331
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
coordinate everything and then finally

332
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,160
you need some kind of page where your

333
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,399
peers can go and actually request the

334
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,160
sessions so with these sort of key

335
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,680
components

336
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,839
you could set up a very similar model to

337
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,839
ours as well

338
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,320
so over you ben thanks jenny

339
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
so thinking about the industry standard

340
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,519
piece you know

341
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,959
we're keen to try and you know we stand

342
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,200
here we use pure db already heavily um

343
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
you need appearing db record to be able

344
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
to appear with meta to appear with

345
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
facebook and now you also need uh you

346
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
can use you know the orphan would be

347
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,519
great to make this standard for

348
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
authentication for peering services

349
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,839
um you know we're keen to use open

350
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,920
source tools um jenny mentioned it a

351
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,959
moment ago

352
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,560
but you know we're using pdb here but

353
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,079
period manager something else that will

354
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,079
fit into what we're talking about for

355
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,600
people to be able to kind of

356
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
build and use this themselves

357
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,839
you know then thinking forward to the

358
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,959
future would you really like to have an

359
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
api in a pragmatic way

360
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
so we can remove human interaction so

361
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,200
for really simple easy peering requests

362
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,639
actually it can be machine to machine

363
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
that talks to set these things up

364
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,519
there's something we're thinking about

365
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,800
something you know the team's working on

366
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,160
if this is something you're interested

367
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,839
in talking to us about and helping

368
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,760
develop them you know please talk to us

369
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
now talk to us later it'd be the hearing

370
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
coordination forum and happy to think

371
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,160
about that more

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
and we've only just begun

373
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,040
you know we've talked about what we've

374
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
got now which is public peering we've

375
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,399
talked about what's coming in the future

376
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,240
private peering we're really trying to

377
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
work out and understand how we can

378
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,120
develop this further you know making the

379
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
cues and the automation around which

380
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,519
what we can accept automatically better

381
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,600
saving more time also we've got our

382
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,959
in-network

383
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,360
cash-in program called fna that's

384
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
currently your email and addressed us

385
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,639
like you would appear in request and

386
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
we're thinking about how we can make

387
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,320
that more automated for the decision

388
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
flow in the future too

389
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,360
call out you know call to action if

390
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
you've not tried this already please

391
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
visit facebook.com

392
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
happy to take feedback if you have any

393
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
you know we'll be at the peer and forums

394
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,399
i mention or you know feel free to pop

395
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,399
us an email

396
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,120
with that questions

397
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
if not i guess a bit of time to go

398
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,839
before appearing

399
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
hello uh i am matt ringle formerly of

400
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,720
subspace

401
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
um

402
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,600
so

403
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
the one question i have here is

404
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,760
um

405
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,279
i'll start with one question i'll see if

406
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,040
you'll allow me to give me a second um

407
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,880
first question is

408
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,839
this effectively gives an api for

409
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,000
actors to

410
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,160
[Music]

411
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,040
um for actors to configure bgp sessions

412
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,320
on your network

413
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,680
what did you consider in terms of the

414
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
threat model

415
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,279
for allowing people to basically

416
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,760
configure routers for you

417
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
so like that's a very good question um

418
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,680
so like we mentioned earlier right we're

419
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,160
not actually allowing you to configure

420
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,000
sessions on the router we're allowing

421
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,160
you to request that we configure the

422
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,760
sessions so you know once you request um

423
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,160
your request will land in a queue um at

424
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
which point we will be reviewing the

425
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,320
items in the queue either by a human or

426
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,760
under certain circumstances

427
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,519
automatically

428
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,480
great

429
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
um the the other question i had is

430
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,600
um so

431
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,519
what goes in so this goes into setting

432
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,639
up the session

433
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,079
what is the

434
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,839
full cert i didn't see in the flowchart

435
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,680
kind of the full circle for the

436
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,000
yes it's up and everybody agrees it's up

437
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,040
and it's doing the right amount of

438
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,880
prefixes and everybody like where does

439
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
that fall into the cycle does that fall

440
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,240
into the catchment of this particular

441
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,320
tool and how so

442
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
sure sure so i don't know if you've

443
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,000
requested peering with us before but

444
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
basically you'll get a series of emails

445
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,759
from us so first you'll get one that

446
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,320
says hi we have configured the sessions

447
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
at the following locations

448
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,920
with the ip addresses then you'll get a

449
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
subsequent one saying

450
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,240
i

451
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,120
we

452
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
in that same workflow then monitor to

453
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
see um or is the traffic up on our side

454
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,800
is are we exchanging traffic with you

455
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,199
and if they come back as established

456
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,800
then we'll send you a second email

457
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
saying although we have noticed that

458
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
these sessions have become established

459
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,120
thank you for peering with us and then

460
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,519
we're finished if for some reason we

461
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,600
don't notice that you are established

462
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,959
then we'll send you some reminder

463
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,240
messages

464
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,959
over the course of about two weeks

465
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,560
saying hello we've noticed you haven't

466
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
configured peering yet

467
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,399
if you're having trouble please contact

468
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
and then our contact mailing list

469
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,160
great thank you

470
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,160
thanks

471
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
all right thank you again today jenny

472
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,560
and ben there might be one

473
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,119
more question

474
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
oh i have to say who i am crap i'm a

475
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,959
dare i'm from internet too we're the

476
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,920
best um i was wondering um if you're

477
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
grabbing all of the information from

478
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,279
peering db

479
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,320
how often do you have to go back to

480
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,800
the submitting person and say

481
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,199
yeah your peering db is not that correct

482
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,920
would you update your information or

483
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,880
correct it for us

484
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,560
um we find generally people keeping up

485
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,079
to date and when we join nix we're

486
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,399
encouraging people to update peer and db

487
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,480
the things we find sometimes are out of

488
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,720
date it might be max prefix um because

489
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
we base some of our uh

490
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,319
you know filters on that basically and

491
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,919
that's sometimes we need to go to but

492
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,119
because people have reached the point

493
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,720
they're already request imperium with us

494
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,319
and we've made it clear we generally

495
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,720
find in most cases up to date okay i was

496
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,799
thinking max prefix as well so thank you

497
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
thanks

498
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,119
cool any other questions

499
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
no guess not okay sorry about that thank

500
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720

501
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,039
thanks so much

502
