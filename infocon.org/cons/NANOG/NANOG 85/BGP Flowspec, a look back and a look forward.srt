2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,680
now i would like to introduce jeffrey

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,960
hawes i say that right jeffrey excellent

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,240
presenting bgp flow spec and look back

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
and i look forward jeffrey is a

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,840
distinguished engineer at juniper

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,039
networks

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,240
chair of the ietf idr inter-domain

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,600
routing

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,680
working group as well as the chair of

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,240
the bfd bi-directional forwarding

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,439
detection

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,880
working groups

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,558
jeffrey traveled to us from michigan and

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,079
we're happy to have him

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,360
here today once again

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
welcome jeffrey and thank you for

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239
talking about bgp thank you

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,440
microphone

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,839
thank you

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,920
so good afternoon i know we're running a

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,680
few minutes late and

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,600
never stand between that oak folk and

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,440
their break so we're trying to keep this

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,719
on time

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,399
so

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,320
i've been uh it's been a few years since

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,840
i've actually been to an anag for

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,760
purposes of giving a talk i've been to a

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
few of them you know uh over the years

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
not anywhere near as much as

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
i probably should

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
you know

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
last time i was here i had a lot less

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
gray in my beard

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,320
these days i have a lot more gray my

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,520
beard because of the thing we're about

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,840
to talk to about today which is no flow

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
spec

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,439
our little picture here shows the fact

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
that we have

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
a rear view mirror with explosions in

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,880
the background and you know this is just

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,400
a thing

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
that is true for flow spec

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
close by causes a lot of pain

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,680
pulling a

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,000
bit of wisdom off of the nadal list you

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
know what is automation

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
it's breaking the network at scale you

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,079
know it's really hard to do

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,759
truly evil things to your network

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,360
without actually having a little bit of

54
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,439
help

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
so just a reminder what what is pgp flow

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,960
spec

57
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,159
no it's a

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
feature that's there to distribute

59
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,479
firewalls into bgp

60
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,759
and repeat that

61
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,280
firewalls into bgp

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
the most important use case for it is

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,680
mitigating denial of service

64
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
it's incredibly helpful we have a large

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,919
number of people across the internet and

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,000
various service providers of you know

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
gigantic size to small

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,760
making successful use of it to actually

69
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,400
mitigate denial of service issues

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,720
so it does get used

71
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,319
it was originally you know put forth an

72
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,440
ietf as an rfc 5575

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
got updated a few years ago uh into a

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,640
dual rc to try to clear up a lot of

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
little small issues there are people in

76
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,000
this room that are responsible for

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
having worked on flowspec some of them

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
say i'm sorry

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,519
but the mix of people that were working

80
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
on it was a nice collaboration of people

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,160
that did work in ietf

82
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
vendors such as myself and you know

83
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
operators that actually had real

84
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,319
problems to solve

85
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,400
so the problem is

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,879
whatever could go wrong we all know this

87
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,400
because we actually

88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,159
get to see this stuff pop up in the news

89
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
when it does go wrong because

90
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
flow spec is about distributing firewall

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,920
rules

92
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,840
and you know firewall rules

93
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
are sometimes the best place to solve

94
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,400
specific types of attacks

95
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,159
it's also a good way to do really clever

96
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,239
things it lets you know

97
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,440
especially if you have the ability to

98
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
interact with features that are popular

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,599
in flowspec like uh redirect deverf

100
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
redirect ip let you actually take this

101
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,280
traffic and send it somewhere else on

102
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
your network to do something useful with

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
it you know you can look at the contents

104
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
of it you can scrub the traffic you can

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,200
mitigate attacks you know people use

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,680
this stuff successfully all the time

107
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,959
you know and that said if you're just

108
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,159
trying to actually stop simple

109
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,840
volumetric attacks and you're willing to

110
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,080
complete the attack itself things like

111
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
real-time black holes still are

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,640
perfectly usable things

113
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,480
so

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,319
the problem we really have is that that

115
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,239
firewall word is in there

116
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,760
firewalls

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
have a lot of features you go to know

118
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
the different sets of vendors across the

119
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,720
entirety of vendor space depending on

120
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,599
you know what they're doing it could be

121
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,599
as simple as linux ip tables it'd be as

122
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,599
complex as something as deep as our srx

123
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
stateful firewall inspection

124
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,159
flowspec tries to actually do a lot of

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,480
the common things that can be done

126
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,159
especially on you know routers that were

127
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,880
originally deployed as asbrs stuff that

128
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,959
is intended to be high speed packet

129
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
forwarding elements that are get the

130
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
traffic through as fast as possible this

131
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
means you can't do

132
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
fancy things like stateful inspection

133
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
you can't

134
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,080
do a number of things that require deep

135
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
digging into a lot of the packets

136
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
although as you're seeing you're getting

137
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
to the direction where that's a desire

138
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,840
so flow spec is mostly limited to the

139
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,040
set of features that is covered by

140
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280
you know the stuff that core routers can

141
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,440
take care of

142
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,199
now the problem with firewalls though is

143
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
that anybody has operated any network

144
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,000
with more than one kind of firewall in

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
you know the network at all knows you

146
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
can't get the full set of things to work

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
exactly as you like some features are

148
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,759
supported universally

149
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
some of them you know have uh various

150
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
issues you know

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
as an example even juniper you know

152
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
which is a long-standing supporter of uh

153
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,919
fosbec we had some issues with dscp and

154
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,320
some implementations back in the day and

155
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
this caused some people problems when

156
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,039
they were trying to have no specific

157
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,720
mixes of rules

158
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
so the challenge that you end up having

159
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
as an operator is

160
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
what can the firewall actually support

161
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,039
are all the operations supported what

162
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,240
happens if you're missing one of the

163
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,520
core primitives that you're trying to

164
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,199
use for mitigation

165
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
and what happens if you have strange

166
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
limitations on them maybe

167
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,560
you know most mechanized arbitrarily

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,080
long port list but if you're restricted

169
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
by the number of no matches you can do

170
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,320
and

171
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
you know what about the scale so

172
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,039
maybe you do perfectly fine for a couple

173
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,479
dozen rules maybe you do fine for

174
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,240
thousands of rules maybe there's a lot

175
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
of that depends in there and of course

176
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
what about bugs

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,080
bugs make people crazy because

178
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,280
just because you think something's

179
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,560
supported

180
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,479
when you need it most sometimes it

181
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,360
doesn't help you so again flowspec is

182
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,639
about distributing firewalls into bgp

183
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
what could go wrong there

184
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,520
now flowspec is a way of serializing

185
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,800
a actual firewall tuple into a bgp route

186
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
an lri

187
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,639
and it allows you to couple these things

188
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
with a set of actions with your match

189
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,800
criteria those usually go into an

190
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
extended community

191
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,919
in bgp it's one of the very few things

192
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,960
that we have that serialize arbitrary

193
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,400
content and it's not strongly structured

194
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
php link state is one of the few other

195
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,400
things that you know do there i do does

196
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,919
that sort of thing

197
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,759
so the challenge is

198
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,240
it's a complicated format

199
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,560
but it lets service providers

200
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,039
rapidly deploy firewall rules across

201
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,560
your network and especially if you're

202
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
using a deployment that's leveraging

203
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,160
route reflectors to do this it can make

204
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,360
your job you know very easy

205
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,240
flowspec lets you actually

206
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
uh accept

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
low spec routes from your customers

208
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
one of the last times i was standing in

209
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,520
the microphone at an analog i said

210
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
are you crazy why would you want to do

211
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,520
this it's a feature that some people

212
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,120
like

213
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,720
it does have some security mechanisms

214
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
there it does have validation but it

215
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
does mean that you know anything that is

216
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
problematic in flowspec itself you're

217
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,840
now taking on that potential damage from

218
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,960
your customers as well

219
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,199
serialization's challenging

220
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,400
you know you look at any number of you

221
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
know mechanisms for doing this sort of

222
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,840
thing you'll find different ways to do

223
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,800
it

224
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
flowspec

225
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
doesn't have universal canonicalization

226
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,800
for things now if you're putting in a

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
list of things

228
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,319
there's not always a single way they do

229
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,759
it this makes a drop a little bit

230
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
challenging

231
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,360
and

232
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
the biggest headache that we have is

233
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
that flow spec

234
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,000
isn't a traditional type length value

235
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
protocol

236
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,840
you know for strange reasons which maybe

237
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,039
somebody will shed a little bit of light

238
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,120
on after the talk is done

239
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
the length field didn't actually make it

240
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
in there and as a consequence we missed

241
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,160
an opportunity to allow the protocol to

242
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
be arbitrarily expended

243
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
so as part of the work that we did in

244
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,280
revving the rfc that flo spec lives in

245
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,199
and we said well it was intended to be

246
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
this opaque thing that didn't work out

247
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,319
so well

248
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
so we're sort of stuck and we now have a

249
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
flowspec v1

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
this is harmed incremental deployment

251
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,559
and pretty much core flow spec has been

252
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,279
frozen since then

253
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,919
and the thing that drives everybody

254
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,240
crazy when they're dealing with flowspec

255
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
half the things that make the news

256
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,600
is that

257
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
the sheer flexibility that flowspec has

258
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
means that

259
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,279
all these things can go wrong and they

260
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,800
can potentially take your bgp

261
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,279
implementation with it it drives people

262
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,360
crazy it makes people afraid of flow

263
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
spec

264
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,120
and

265
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,279
you know if you get a session reset

266
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,399
you know and you're not separating

267
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,560
things well that takes everything along

268
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
for the ride

269
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
strong recommendation that we have these

270
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,160
days is that flow specs

271
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,519
deployed as a separate session

272
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,560
so

273
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
this is a firewall

274
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
the problem with firewalls is firewalls

275
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,200
are all about world ordering so what do

276
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
you do about that when these things are

277
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
coming in your network is a completely

278
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
arbitrary set of things potentially from

279
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
many routing sources

280
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,959
so

281
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,000
lowspec

282
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
as part of the rfc decided to do a

283
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
canonical rule order

284
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,040
order is important for no firewalls you

285
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
have to make a choice the choice is

286
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,519
basically there to allow for firewall

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,240
ruling against ddos and that order

288
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
actually works out okay

289
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
now destination's the first thing you

290
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,800
match on you basically work your way

291
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
down the list you know based on you know

292
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,640
the different component types they're

293
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
ordered by the things that largely make

294
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,040
sense and then pass that it you know

295
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
longer it is the more specific it is

296
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
you'll filter that to the top and

297
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
generally it will do the right thing but

298
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,760
sometimes you can't get a firewall

299
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,120
behavior

300
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
for a type of attack traffic that you

301
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
really want to you know flowspec

302
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
ordering just doesn't let you handle

303
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,680
that

304
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,160
and it's great for simple ddos

305
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,519
but it's not great if you want to do

306
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,920
anything sophisticated

307
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
so

308
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,279
for some cases right now you're just

309
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,600
stuck

310
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
and

311
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
you know the problem you have is that

312
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
the flexibility that you're desiring

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
being able to order things somewhat

314
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,399
arbitrarily

315
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,240
well if you're in a real firewall you

316
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,519
move things around in the protocol you

317
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,680
don't get to do that of course you add

318
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
bugs as another consideration

319
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
my colleagues dr tony p

320
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,519
has a very bit of useful wisdom about

321
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,399
bgp it is a swiss army knife it has

322
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,079
no handle it's just all knives it's a

323
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,320
very sharp tool you will cut yourself at

324
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
some point if you are an operator every

325
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,320
one of you in this room that has no some

326
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
sort access to a router will have that

327
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
oops moment which you know if you

328
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,640
haven't lost your job from it

329
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,320
you'll definitely you know

330
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
have that pale look on your face is all

331
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,600
the blood's drained out is my network

332
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
actually still working

333
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,839
sometimes the best tool for the job will

334
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,760
cut you you know so despite the fact

335
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
that flowspec is a sharp and dangerous

336
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,800
tool it has helped so many customers and

337
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
this is why we keep seeing it used it's

338
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,079
why we keep on seeing it

339
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:30,800
you know

340
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,720
pushed you know for more features you

341
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,640
know to extend things despite the fact

342
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
that it's got so many problems

343
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,440
large scale scale providers use it every

344
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,160
day to protect their customers

345
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,040
it's largely vendor-neutral

346
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
with the problems we were talking about

347
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,880
and as much as you know people talk

348
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,399
about why are we dumping all the stuff

349
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,000
inside of bgp you know one of my other

350
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,279
colleagues likes to say you know the

351
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,200
protocol is not a dump truck

352
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,920
well as much as you know that colleague

353
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
likes to say such things and he'll speak

354
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
for himself at some point later i

355
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
suspect

356
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
you have to get the stuff around your

357
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
network sometimes and

358
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,440
sometimes in-band has strong advantages

359
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
to it and even if it was out of band you

360
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
still have to figure out what other

361
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,279
channel could it go into do you put it

362
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,760
into that cuff do you put it in grpc

363
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,120
you're going to still have a lot of the

364
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,519
same headaches we're talking about

365
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,959
just because you have a different

366
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,639
mechanism doesn't mean the headaches

367
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
necessarily go away

368
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
and being able to couple the stuff with

369
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
your routing especially when you know

370
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,959
use cases such as matching stuff against

371
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,320
uh

372
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,839
you know customer routes if you're doing

373
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,480
customer bgp for flow spec or if you're

374
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,160
doing redirection and you want the

375
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
redirection to use tunneling to you know

376
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,959
mitigate the traffic by off-ramping

377
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
having a couple day routing protocol can

378
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
do the job so the question is what can

379
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
we do to help

380
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,200
things do better

381
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,480
so we start getting into you know a

382
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,399
little bit of the future

383
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,880
flow spec v1 as i mentioned was sort of

384
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,639
stuck you know it was partially

385
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,480
misdesigned we have to have a way to

386
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
actually allow things to move forward

387
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
with an ietf the idea working group that

388
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
i'm a co-chair of does have work going

389
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
on for flow spec v2

390
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
the goal of that is to try to actually

391
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,880
fix some of the issues that we found

392
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,959
some of them are very simple

393
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,720
number one make the thing an explicit

394
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
type length value field

395
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,639
to make sure that we can incrementally

396
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
deploy new features without problem

397
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,200
now this gets rid of the issue of

398
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
session resets it allows features to be

399
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,160
added incrementally

400
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,000
second thing and incredibly important

401
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
one

402
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
is allow that explicit rule ordering

403
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,760
cases where the operator needs to bypass

404
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
the usual rules for flowspec for some

405
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,800
specific reason sometimes it's just as

406
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
simple as having a firewall you know

407
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
implement things as a order that you're

408
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,160
expecting sometimes it's because an

409
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,320
implementation has limitations that

410
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,000
reordering can make things better

411
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,399
it also allows us potentially long term

412
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,120
to do in the flow spec v2 smarter action

413
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,320
clustering

414
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,839
right now if you have features such as

415
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,480
redirect ip redirect to verv

416
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
and we have no additional things like

417
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
redirect to path id we're starting to

418
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,240
see these things

419
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
as additional rule chains have

420
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
interactions with each other

421
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,760
having the protocol be clear about how

422
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,040
they work together is important

423
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,440
a big problem that we have ietf wide and

424
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
you as operators are having to deal with

425
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,480
especially as you move to

426
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
controller-based networks is

427
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,480
how do you deal with

428
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,639
scoping things making sure that your

429
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,720
features that are working around your

430
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,839
network

431
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
can actually be successfully deployed in

432
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,160
the places that do understand them and

433
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,880
places where if it's harmful

434
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,800
can you avoid deploying them there or

435
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,480
potentially just simply allow your

436
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
controllers to figure out

437
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,760
if there's support for this thing over

438
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,839
here do something smart at the place

439
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,760
that has the brains for it everything

440
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,120
else maybe i do something slightly

441
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,519
dumber that still helps

442
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,560
so

443
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,680
work shall i actually be happening

444
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,079
inside the ietf to help with this you

445
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,680
know across idr and a few other places

446
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,240
and part of this is also going to be

447
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,639
limitation features to allow things like

448
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,720
flowspec to only go as far as it

449
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
actually needs to go

450
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
so

451
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,880
as i mentioned you know being able to

452
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
figure out what your devices can do

453
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
capability discovery is a thing that is

454
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,880
becoming a general topic

455
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,160
you know it's not essentially

456
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,000
distributed around ietf you know we have

457
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,839
examples of if you're running mpls as a

458
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
network and you're doing you know label

459
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,199
imposition

460
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,519
having features to do maximum segment

461
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,959
depth as an example that live in the igp

462
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,240
can help things

463
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
actually do appropriate mpls and

464
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,680
position

465
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
smarter you don't try to overflow your

466
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,279
label stack accidentally in your

467
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
deployment

468
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,040
the question is where you start putting

469
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,120
these features do they show up inside

470
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
the igp do they show up outside the igp

471
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,240
there's attention both directions

472
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,600
very low on time

473
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,759
my last slide

474
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,839
things that are happening in ietf you

475
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,160
know with flowspec v2 again the whole

476
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,000
point is to allow the door to open for

477
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,519
new features again

478
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,279
we have flexible payload matching to be

479
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,320
able to do

480
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,560
matching on payload contents we have a

481
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
desire for doing matching on things that

482
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720
are layer two related sometimes layer

483
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
two vpns

484
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
matching on the contents of tunnel

485
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,600
traffic which if you're doing fancy

486
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,360
encapsulations as part of your network

487
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,440
designs especially if you're doing

488
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,920
tunneling across udp for g or gre or

489
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,040
other things

490
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,920
you know

491
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
doing those things breaks your ability

492
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
to do staple firewall or a non-staple

493
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,880
firewall that's a problem for you these

494
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
extensions potentially can help

495
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,959
and we're seeing not only for more

496
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,399
interesting science

497
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
no experiment type mechanisms that may

498
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,360
turn into more general mechanisms we're

499
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,600
also seeing things like segment routing

500
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
as a technology

501
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,959
starting to get more coverage as well

502
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,320
and flow spec

503
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,120
so

504
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
what is my request to you

505
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,599
as operators please pay attention to the

506
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
work in ietf whether directly or know

507
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
through your vendors

508
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,039
