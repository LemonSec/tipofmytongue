[Music]

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,080
so at this time let me introduce

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,639
jeff bennett presenting optical fiber

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,759
capacity limits where do we go next jeff

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,759
is director solutions and technology at

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,960
infera

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,760
are

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,400
in for nera

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
this is jeff's first time presenting at

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,920
nadang and it's a pleasure to have him

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,039
speaking with us today welcome jeff

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,800
thanks james

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,199
afternoon everyone uh i'd just like to

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,960
thank the program committee actually for

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,880
giving me the opportunity to present

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
this tutorial and i hope i'll uh do it

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
justice so let's get right down to it

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,920
um i'll be starting with some basic

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
terminology but i did want to say that

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,640
this is not really an optical

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,719
uh transmission tutorial it's about

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,039
fiber limits uh there is an excellent

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
tutorial by richard steenbergen uh some

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,600
of you may have seen it uh at uh nanook

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,879
77

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,440
uh and uh it's online it's recorded of

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,960
course in fact richard's done a couple

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,720
of these tutorials

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,920
so

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
let me just remind everybody i mean you

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
know you guys are a router people i used

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,960
to be a router person i worked for

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,200
proteon and well fleet back in the late

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
80s early 90s and then four systems

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,280
so

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,600
i then transferred over into optical and

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,320
i used to draw networks like this where

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
we're connecting paris which is

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,439
obviously in ontario uh and berlin in

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,119
connecticut there used to be a berlin in

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,040
ontario as well actually until about

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
1917 i think

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,479
but actually

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,040
instead of that line uh we really need

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,560
to think that it's it's an optical

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,920
network it may be a simple

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
point-to-point link but there will be

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,560
these elements uh of uh optical fiber

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
connecting these two locations

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,240
and at the end points there's gonna be

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,200
some equipment in the data center or pop

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
we're going to have something like a

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
rhodum or a terminal uh rhodum is an

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
optical switch

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,200
and transponders which actually put the

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,759
ones and zeros uh onto the onto the

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,280
fiber itself

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,000
along the root we have amplifier sites

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,758
in long-haul networks

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,760
typically these are every 50 to 100

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
kilometers

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,879
and that this is a really important

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,200
aspect of fiber capacity as as we'll see

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
the amplifiers themselves uh

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
one of the enabling technologies for

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
dwdm which is where we put lots of

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
colors of light down the same fiber

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,280
was the erbium dope fiber amplifier and

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,760
the key aspect was that this single

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,440
amplifier is able to boost the the power

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
of lots of different wavelengths in a

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
single device

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,120
if we'd have to have individual devices

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,519
for every different wavelength wdm would

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
not be an economic technology

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,360
i also want to tell you the difference

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
between client and line side optics

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
because

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,239
you may be a lot more familiar with

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,879
client optics so if we zoom into the

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,239
transponder itself which is the

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,800
demarcation point between these two

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
on one side you have client optics and

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
these are typically short distance

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,159
single channel and ethernet framed 100

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,879
gige 400 gige

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,560
you connect those into your switches or

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,480
routers on the line side we have optics

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
that are designed for much longer

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
distance they will be

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,599
also designed to

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,840
output multiple channels now

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,400
eventually this will be dwdm but even on

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
a single wavelength you may be carrying

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,440
multiple ethernet services because you

96
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,560
could have an 800 gigabit wavelength and

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
it could be carrying two 400 gige

98
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,760
services or one 400 gig service and four

99
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
100 gig services

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,239
and uh so it would be framed uh

101
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,319
appropriately

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,480
and that will attach into some kind of

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
aspect of the line system like a rodeo

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
an optical switch or a terminal

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
and there will be lots of other

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
transponders that join it

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,080
and that's how we get multiple colors

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
onto the fiber

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
so client optics are very unlikely to

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,159
reach fiber capacity limits because

111
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
they really just carry a single service

112
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,799
whereas line side optics these are the

113
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,439
the devices that are much more likely to

114
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,040
reach those limits

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,918
so why do you care that fiber has a

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,320
capacity limit well of course when you

117
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
when you look at these optical networks

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,479
with lots of links in them

119
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
we know that demand is growing at a

120
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,560
phenomenal rate about 30 percent year on

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
year um and

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
some of these fiber routes are becoming

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
full you'll notice i've i put that in

124
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,680
inverted commas because

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,919
different fiber pair operators will have

126
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,919
different views about what full actually

127
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,759
means

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,199
so i talked about amplifiers and

129
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,320
long-haul

130
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
networks have to include these optical

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
amplifiers typically we use erbium doped

132
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,759
fiber amplifiers or edfas we also use

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,639
roman amplifiers and these typically

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,320
amplify in

135
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,440
two bands the c band or the c band and l

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,479
band

137
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,600
and

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,759
most networks today are still using c

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
band although it's becoming increasingly

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
popular now to light up the l band as

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,440
well

142
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,000
and the bandwidth of the amplifiers will

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
determine how much fiber spectrum we can

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,919
actually use

145
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,240
so you know i'll be explaining more

146
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
about that in a moment

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,120
so historically we were able to scale

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,880
total fiber capacity uh by increasing

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
the wavelength data rate or putting more

150
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,160
and more wavelengths onto the fiber or

151
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
both depending where we were in in

152
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
technical evolution because the fiber

153
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,320
capacity

154
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,080
is the product of the wavelength data

155
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
rate and the number of wavelengths

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
and we may be approaching

157
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,039
capacity limits in in optical fiber

158
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,039
today depending on

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,800
which routes we're talking about and how

160
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
busy your networks are

161
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,160
so what are the limits and what are the

162
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,280
options

163
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
um and

164
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,479
you know i'm i'm about to show an

165
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,479
equation and there's this old adage that

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,319
every time you show an equation you lose

167
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
about half your audience but stick with

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,440
it because

169
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,919
it's a pretty easy equation really um

170
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,840
it's the shannon equation i've

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,120
simplified it down to two basic terms

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,199
and what we're really calculating here

173
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,080
is the fiber capacity claude shannon was

174
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
a researcher at bell labs in the late

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
1940s so obviously he wasn't working

176
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
with optical fiber he was working with

177
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
wireless and and telegraphy you know

178
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
copper cable technology um optical fiber

179
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,440
is a little bit different but basically

180
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,479
it will follow a similar trajectory

181
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,080
because on the right hand side of that

182
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
equation we have the bandwidth term

183
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
uh and that's how much of the fiber

184
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
spectrum are we able to use how much can

185
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,240
we amplify

186
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,080
and then we have this term the

187
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,319
signal-to-noise ratio term and the

188
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,800
signal is how strong is the signal by

189
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,039
the time it reaches the receiver the

190
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199
noise how much noise has been added

191
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
during its journey so it's a relatively

192
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,919
basic and simple equation there's a

193
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,360
little bit of a glitch

194
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
because optical fiber

195
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,240
is a non-linear medium

196
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
and that's different from the media that

197
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,319
shannon was researching

198
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,680
air is is linear copper is linear but

199
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,520
fiber is is non-linear well what does

200
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
that mean

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
what is a non-linear effect so imagine

202
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,759
you're listening to music at home and

203
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,160
you keep on turning up the volume at

204
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,960
some point that music starts to distort

205
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,039
it it could be because your headphones

206
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,120
are distorting maybe the amplifiers

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
distorting speakers whatever but

208
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,919
something is not able to handle that

209
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,240
that power level and that's really

210
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
what's happening in optical fiber

211
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
above a certain optical power level the

212
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,479
signal starts to distort it adds noise

213
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,360
which reduces the optical performance

214
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
and there are several different

215
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
non-linear effects i'm not going to go

216
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,479
into them because they are all bad right

217
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,759
we want to avoid them if we possibly can

218
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,000
now the shannon limit that that some

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
people talk about when we're applying uh

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
this term to optical fiber i would uh

221
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
suggest to you that it's not really a

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,520
limit and shannon was not involved

223
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
because he wasn't working with a

224
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,080
non-linear medium so what does what am i

225
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
talking about here well this graph on

226
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,440
the vertical axis is showing capacity

227
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,759
and the horizontal axis shows optical

228
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,639
reach

229
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,640
optical reach is really important for

230
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,479
network economics

231
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,320
what it means is the distance that you

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
can transmit at a particular data rate

233
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,360
without needing to digitally regenerate

234
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,240
the signal you can amplify amplifiers

235
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,600
are analog

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
if you have to digitally regenerate

237
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,279
that's going to cost you a lot of money

238
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,480
so

239
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,240
the curve will look something like this

240
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
the further you go the lower the

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,720
capacity of the fiber will be

242
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,519
and

243
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,839
we can think of this blue line as the

244
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
shannon limit which would be the

245
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,920
capacity at a given optical reach if

246
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
optical fiber was a linear medium but

247
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,519
it's not

248
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,880
so

249
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,560
this is more like the limit that we're

250
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
talking about this is the capacity limit

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
at a given optical reach when we reach

252
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,920
the non-linear threshold so we turn the

253
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,040
power

254
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,920
up

255
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
and just before it starts to distort

256
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,160
that's our limit

257
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
now there's another limit which lies

258
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
between the two

259
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,000
and this is the practical limit this is

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
the performance limit of a modern

261
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,839
transponder

262
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,080
because modern transponders have ways to

263
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,120
either mitigate or deal with non-linear

264
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,519
effects it's not perfect which is why

265
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,800
the green line is is below the blue line

266
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
but we actually can operate oops hang on

267
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
let me just go back

268
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
we can

269
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,279
oh that must be in a an earlier version

270
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,240
of the slide we can operate

271
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,279
uh slightly above or slightly below

272
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,040
that green line

273
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
um there are definitely occasions

274
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,600
especially in submarine cables where you

275
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
might operate slightly above the line

276
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
and you would implement non-linear

277
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,079
compensation or you operate below the

278
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,199
line deliberately

279
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
so

280
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,880
how do we expand this capacity we can

281
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,600
look at the b term or we can look at the

282
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
snr term

283
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,079
so

284
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,360
if we plot out the bandwidth term we see

285
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
that it's nice and linear

286
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,480
so

287
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
that looks like the best way to to

288
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,360
invest uh you know increasing bandwidth

289
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
increases the capacity by a linear uh

290
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
amount

291
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
if we improve the signal-to-noise ratio

292
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,959
term we are trapped inside a logarithm

293
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,000
and so the we start to get a diminishing

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,399
return as we improve the signal to noise

295
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,800
ratio and this is really where we're at

296
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
in terms of things like transponder

297
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
development today we're starting to

298
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,839
approach that uh that

299
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,480
limit

300
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,240
so what have we learned so far

301
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,320
optical fiber is the only medium that

302
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,839
that we know that allows ultra high

303
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,079
capacity over long distances we use

304
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,800
multiple wavelengths to boost capacity

305
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,120
uh optical fiber is a non-linear medium

306
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
and signals will distort if we exceed

307
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,279
certain power levels and every optical

308
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,279
fiber in the world has its own

309
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,920
theoretical non-linear capacity limit

310
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,000
we can better understand where to look

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,959
for

312
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,959
the best return using the shannon

313
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
equation

314
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,480
so now

315
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,000
we need to understand also that

316
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
increasing fiber capacity will have an

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,240
operational and financial impact so what

318
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,800
do i mean by that there's really

319
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,760
three steps three steps in this process

320
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
the first step which is the most

321
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,880
desirable is to keep the existing fiber

322
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
and the existing line systems the

323
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,120
rodents and the amplifiers

324
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,560
now really the only option you have

325
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
there is to change the transponders and

326
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
track the transponder evolution cycle

327
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,639
option two keep your existing fiber but

328
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,279
consider bandwidth bandwidth upgrades to

329
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,440
the line system that will allow us to

330
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,200
amplify more of the optical fiber

331
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
spectrum

332
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,959
and then option three consider new fiber

333
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,639
and new line systems which is obviously

334
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,839
the most drastic and expensive of these

335
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,560
so

336
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,639
the technology evolution of the fiber

337
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,240
that you have in the ground today is

338
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,399
quite interesting because it's an asset

339
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,880
that keeps on giving

340
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,040
so how does optical fiber work

341
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,839
well

342
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,480
if we look down the the the end of a

343
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
fiber

344
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
we might be able to see that there's

345
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,959
actually an inner core and an outer

346
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,800
cladding in the fiber

347
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
the cladding is made from pure silica

348
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
and the core has a little bit of

349
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,880
germanium oxide in it and that raises

350
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,680
the refractive index of the core so if

351
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,839
you plot the refractive index profile

352
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
it's actually a gradient these days uh

353
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
profile and that gradient

354
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,120
um

355
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,279
sometimes people say that optical fiber

356
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,760
works by total internal reflection it

357
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
doesn't because the light wouldn't go

358
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,560
very far if it did work that way but the

359
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,040
light is guided within the core of the

360
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
fiber that's why we say that optical

361
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,920
fiber is a waveguide

362
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,959
now we make the core of the fiber very

363
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,839
narrow so there is only room for one

364
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,000
path or one mode of propagation

365
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
and that's why we have single mode fiber

366
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,560
today by using single mode fiber we

367
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,639
avoid one of the most serious

368
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,720
distortions you can get in optical fiber

369
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,800
which is modal dispersion some of you

370
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,519
may deal with multi-mode fiber and you

371
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,000
know that signals don't go very far on

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
multi-mode fiber it used to be a lot

373
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
cheaper than single mode fiber these

374
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,680
days the difference is

375
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,720
you know almost zero

376
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,800
now optical fiber apart from being a

377
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,000
waveguide

378
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
it really doesn't absorb much of the

379
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,519
energy of the signal we call that

380
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,760
attenuation how much of the energy of

381
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
the signal is absorbed per kilometer of

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,279
fiber

383
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,240
well let me give you a a little bit of a

384
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,760
thought example here assume there are

385
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,320
3.28 times 10 to the power 80 particles

386
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,560
in the observable universe

387
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
here's the question

388
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,120
if you have an amazing detector designer

389
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,199
and they manage to design a single

390
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,279
photon detector

391
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,920
and you have optical fiber

392
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
like we had back at the beginning of the

393
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,800
1970s the breakthrough in optical fiber

394
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,199
was considered that if you could

395
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,279
design optical fiber with loss of less

396
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,000
than 20 db per kilometer you might be

397
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
able to use it for communications that

398
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,680
was the kind of fiber we had back in the

399
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
1970s

400
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,160
so

401
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,120
how many photon or how far could you go

402
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,199
along fiber like that

403
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,519
before you'd have to put more photons

404
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,880
than there are particles in the

405
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
observable universe in order to get one

406
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
photon out at the other end

407
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,079
well those of you who like hitchhiker's

408
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,199
guide to the galaxy are going to be

409
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,760
delighted here because the answer is f

410
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,920
42 right

411
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,880
now

412
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
42 kilometers is not very far and we

413
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
have to put an awful lot of photons in

414
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
there and by the way we can't build a

415
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
single photon detector so let's let's

416
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,440
get more realistic what about the fiber

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,000
we have today the kind of optical fiber

418
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
that that's designed today like

419
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,120
corning's smf 28 ull

420
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,720
this has a loss of 0.17 db per kilometer

421
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
much much lower remember the the the db

422
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,360
scale is a logarithmic scale so this is

423
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,680
a lot lower loss

424
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
so over a distance of 42 kilometers to

425
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
get one photon out of the end of that

426
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,880
fiber we only need to put five photons

427
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,320
in at the beginning

428
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
so that's a big improvement on you know

429
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,480
3.28 times 10 to the power 80.

430
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
so a typical amplifier spacing is 100

431
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
kilometers and we'd only need 50 photons

432
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,519
into the fiber to get one photon out the

433
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,000
other end well actually

434
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,160
what about the number of photons that is

435
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,480
normally found in a modulation symbol

436
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,040
that comes out of a transponder well

437
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,279
actually it's about 10 to the power 18

438
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,680
photons that come out of a

439
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,279
of a transponder when you send a

440
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,800
modulation symbol

441
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,519
so

442
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,959
you know this is this is really good

443
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,120
news that optical fiber has this very

444
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,839
very low

445
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,880
loss now

446
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,959
unfortunately it doesn't have low

447
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
attenuation across the whole spectrum

448
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,639
if we plot out the attenuation of the

449
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,920
fiber it looks some something like this

450
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,800
so

451
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,440
the lower the attenuation the further

452
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
apart our amplifier sites can be and the

453
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
better our network economics

454
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,639
shorter wavelengths than than that

455
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
minimum there you see

456
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
shorter wavelengths are scattered that's

457
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,240
why the loss is much higher

458
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
longer wavelengths are actually absorbed

459
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,839
by the silica

460
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,040
so we have this really interesting

461
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,720
situation where there are some anomalies

462
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,040
these are typically water anomalies you

463
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,520
can remove water

464
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
from the manufacturing process of

465
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,280
optical fiber but it's kind of expensive

466
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,720
to do that

467
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,079
you can buy

468
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,720
low water loss fiber but we don't use

469
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
those wavelengths anyway so

470
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,959
you know typically you don't remove the

471
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,640
water from fiber

472
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,439
there is a clear sweet spot here uh from

473
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,520
about 1.53 to 1.65 microns or

474
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,840
15 30 nanometers to 15 to 1650

475
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
nanometers which are the c and the l

476
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,039
bands

477
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,919
so the c and the l bands um

478
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
these are the the sweet spot for optical

479
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
transmission because optical fiber

480
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,039
attenuation is so low and we're getting

481
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,080
very close with silica core fiber we're

482
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
getting very close to the theoretical

483
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,200
minimum

484
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
attenuation today

485
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,039
so in long distance

486
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,720
transmission we can only use as much of

487
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,480
the spectrum as we can practically

488
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,360
amplify now some of you may be using

489
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,039
shorter reach uh devices that use coarse

490
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,280
wavelength division multiplexing and you

491
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
use much more of the spectrum but you

492
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,600
don't use it for higher capacity you use

493
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,720
it because it's cheap

494
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,640
but the things that that typically are

495
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
limiting us at the moment are amplifiers

496
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
particularly edfas

497
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,440
so when edfa works in a very simple way

498
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
you have about 10 to 30 meters of

499
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,919
doped fiber so this is fiber that's had

500
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,000
a little bit of a rare earth element

501
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
erbium added to it

502
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
and so you've got your regular fiber

503
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,679
that then feeds into this coil of doped

504
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,480
fiber and you use a very powerful laser

505
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,280
to pump that fiber and energize it so

506
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
that it amplifies uh weak signals and

507
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,799
sends them out as very strong signals

508
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,360
and it sends out the whole band

509
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,760
it amplifies across a a fairly wide band

510
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
of wavelengths

511
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
and here we see the c band uh and the l

512
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
band shown and

513
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,400
we need an edfa in the c band

514
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,320
and we use a different advert in the l

515
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,679
band you can't

516
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,400
you can't quite get uh enough uh

517
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,120
bandwidth uh to to cover both bands at

518
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
the same time but

519
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
c-band edgers have

520
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,480
uh increased their bandwidth over time

521
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,200
the very first edfas back in the early

522
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,080
90s had a bandwidth of about 3.6

523
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,640
terahertz we then had four terahertz

524
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,720
then today we're using uh 4.8 terahertz

525
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,880
and there are plans to extend that even

526
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
further to six terahertz it's known as

527
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
super c band it's in a single ad first

528
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,919
so you you you're able to

529
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,720
amplify six terahertz of bandwidth all

530
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,799
at once and then a similar thing happens

531
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
in the l band

532
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,480
typically we just talk about l band

533
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,799
doubling capacity in fact l band is a

534
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,039
bit wider than the c band

535
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,720
but usually we do just talk about

536
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,600
doubling the capacity so super c and

537
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,080
super l in a few years time would give

538
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,400
us about 12 terahertz of amplified

539
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,880
bandwidth

540
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,240
and there are other optical

541
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
amplification

542
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,000
amplification options like roman

543
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,880
amplification and this offers very low

544
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,360
noise high gain amplification it's more

545
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,720
expensive

546
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,360
some operators don't like to use it

547
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
because there are operational procedures

548
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,520
that you need to train your staff in uh

549
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
for reman the pump roman pumps are very

550
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
very powerful and they operate in the

551
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
infrared so

552
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
it can be shining into your eye you

553
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,280
don't know it because it's not visible

554
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,799
and it can be burning uh you know

555
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,720
damaging your eyesight so there are lots

556
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
of interesting operational factors with

557
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,679
roman

558
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,240
um but it can be used for wide band

559
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,400
amplification beyond the c and the l

560
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
bands um and it can be used in

561
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
combination with edphas that's very

562
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,440
common uh it is commonly used today in

563
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,159
long-haul networks as a hybrid reman

564
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,200
edfa

565
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
amplifier

566
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,640
there's a technology called soas

567
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,880
semiconductor optical amplifiers um

568
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,480
they're very very small they're similar

569
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,280
to a laser in size um

570
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,120
they have excellent game but they have a

571
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,559
higher noise factor than edfa's

572
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,520
and

573
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
we tend to think of them as being very

574
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
challenging for multi-wavelength

575
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,679
operation it's like an edfar will boost

576
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,280
all of the wavelengths in the c band at

577
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
the same time it's tricky to do that

578
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,039
with soas um although there's been some

579
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
work on soas where they think they can

580
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,720
average out the noise but you know

581
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
generally speaking they're not used as

582
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,000
external amplifiers they may be used as

583
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,960
part of the laser chip set in a in a

584
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,080
photonic integration design

585
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,559
so soa is interesting they're definitely

586
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,720
used within the transponder they're not

587
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,799
used uh in external amplifiers today

588
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,400
so what about using more of the grid uh

589
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,200
the the wavelength grid uh in a more

590
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,120
effective way so i'm going to be talking

591
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,679
about fixed grid versus flexible grid

592
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,400
and we think really uh about dwdm in

593
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
terms of like lanes on a highway

594
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,679
um

595
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,480
and

596
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,640
how do individual wavelengths how do the

597
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,520
individual cars on the highway uh play

598
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
nicely when there are other cars uh

599
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,600
close by how did how do the wavelengths

600
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,039
share the spectrum

601
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,919
well

602
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,200
from about 1995 to 2013 the only

603
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
commercial approach was a fixed

604
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,120
wavelength grid actually a fixed

605
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,720
frequency grid

606
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,520
and total fiber capacity tended to be

607
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,480
limited by the grid itself so what

608
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,760
happens

609
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,200
over time is that the grid granularity

610
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,880
got better and better as more um

611
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,520
more granular wavelength multiplexing

612
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
and demultiplexing technology became

613
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,520
available so we started off with grid

614
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,000
spacing of 200 gigahertz then that went

615
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,640
to 100 gigahertz a lot of you will be

616
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,200
familiar with 50 gigahertz grid systems

617
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,799
they were um

618
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,640
very very common for a long time and

619
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,799
there are some 25 gigahertz grid systems

620
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,280
out there as well the number of channels

621
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,600
you typically get in a classic four

622
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
terahertz c band uh with those uh grid

623
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,360
settings 20 channels increasing to 40

624
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,840
channels increasing to 80 increasing to

625
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,880
160. the more channels you have the more

626
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,080
fiber capacity that you have

627
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
so

628
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,520
what happened at some point is that we

629
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,159
moved away from uh from fixed grid

630
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,919
because there's some key information

631
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,520
here

632
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
you can increase the data rate of a

633
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,840
transponder by sending modulation

634
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,000
symbols more quickly we call that the

635
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,279
baud rate

636
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,120
the rate at which you send modulation

637
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
symbols if you have a higher baud rate

638
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
signal it is wider it occupies more

639
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,840
frequency

640
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
in fact if you double the baud rate you

641
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,600
double the the spectral width of the

642
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,799
signal

643
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,600
so

644
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,640
if you now apply this to fixed grid wdm

645
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,440
systems this is 80 channels at 50

646
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,080
gigahertz so this is a very very common

647
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,760
uh grid pattern

648
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
and what we see

649
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
i'll give you three examples of signals

650
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,679
that we might put on here this is

651
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,720
working very well for a 32 gigaboard

652
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,120
carrier that fits nicely into a 50

653
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
gigahertz uh grid spacing

654
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,880
a um a low board rate signal though

655
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,720
would be wasting lots of capacity

656
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
because it's a very narrow signal and

657
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,640
it's got lots of space in the in the

658
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,120
grid slot around it so that's stranded

659
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,360
capacity you can't use that

660
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
but then if you have ultra high board

661
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,120
rate signals as we're now getting uh

662
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
with modern transponders that can be up

663
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,279
to 100 gigaboard uh these are not

664
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
compatible with fixed grip this 50

665
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
gigahertz grid um because the grid

666
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
spacing is too narrow

667
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,840
so what do we do we move to flexible

668
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
grid with flexible grid we throw the

669
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,279
idea away of fixed grid slots we create

670
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,000
flexible grid slots with 12 12.5

671
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,200
gigahertz granularity and each flexible

672
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
slot can be right size for the signal

673
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
that it needs to carry

674
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,240
so

675
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,159
in essence you don't have grid uh grid

676
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,000
spacings and all of these signals could

677
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,279
live happily

678
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,760
in different parts of the fiber spectrum

679
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,360
and flexible grid

680
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,679
systems first of all they waste less

681
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,840
stranded spectrum and secondly they

682
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,400
support high baud rate signals

683
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,559
and they are being used today for higher

684
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,440
optical performance levels

685
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,120
so what have we learned about optical

686
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
fiber capacity optical fiber acts as a

687
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,159
waveguide it traps the signal inside so

688
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,840
that it can go further without losing

689
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,279
integrity a given pair of optical fiber

690
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,520
fibers has a practical capacity that's

691
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,120
defined by things like the low

692
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,600
attenuation uh bandwidth of the of the

693
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,919
silica uh the signal-to-noise ratio

694
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,760
performance of the system the amplifiers

695
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,960
and so on

696
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,039
and the lowest attenuation parts of

697
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,559
today's fiber are in the c and the

698
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,679
l-bands

699
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,200
we have to be able to amplify the

700
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,159
signals uh and so edva's raman and

701
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,919
hybrid edge for roman

702
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
are the way that that we use uh

703
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,200
amplifiers today

704
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
the wavelength uh multiplexing grid also

705
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,760
affects capacity we've moved or

706
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,320
we we can move away from fixed grid

707
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,720
systems towards flex grid systems you

708
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,559
may still have fixed grid systems in the

709
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,520
metro

710
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,720
metro networks are probably less likely

711
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,200
to be stressed in terms of capacity

712
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
so you know maybe you're not under

713
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,200
stress to to move to a flexible grid

714
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
so now i'd like to take a look at the

715
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,919
evolution of transponder technology so

716
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,400
before we had coherent transponders

717
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,559
which i'll talk about in a moment we had

718
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,880
direct detect and direct detect

719
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,600
transponders are very very simple uh

720
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,919
it's almost like morse code if there's

721
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,679
light it's a one if there's no light

722
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,400
it's a zero slightly more tricky than

723
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
that but

724
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
that's really simple technology but that

725
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,120
suited us fine for transmission at 2.5

726
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
gigabits per second per wavelength or

727
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
even 10 gigabits per second per

728
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
wavelength no problem simple

729
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,000
transponders simple receivers and so on

730
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,679
the challenge was to scale that

731
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,240
technology beyond 10 gigabits per second

732
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,159
per wavelength because of various

733
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,480
impairments in the optical fiber

734
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,080
so

735
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
these are linear impairments and one of

736
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,200
the downsides of a direct detect system

737
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,399
like this a direct detector is not a

738
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,399
linear detector it's actually a square

739
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,679
law detector and if you try to

740
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,399
compensate mathematically for linear

741
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
impairments with a square law detector

742
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,679
that gets very complicated

743
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,960
so

744
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,279
we can add to our fixed grid table with

745
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,120
the maximum wavelength data rates we

746
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,200
could achieve with direct detect

747
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,080
so 200 gigabits per second uh in a in a

748
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,760
20 channel system

749
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,240
scaling up to 1.6 terabits per second in

750
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,279
the c band of a of a 25 gigahertz grid

751
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,320
system with 160 channels so this

752
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,799
capacity evolution took place from about

753
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,600
from about 1995 which is when wdm became

754
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,960
commercially available up to about 2007.

755
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,039
that was driven by higher quality

756
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,360
wavelength multiplexing components the

757
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,039
trunk 10 gig transponders had been

758
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,440
available since about 1998

759
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,840
and 10 gigabits remained the wavelength

760
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,880
data rate until about 2007.

761
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,480
but then what happened

762
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,720
is that we suddenly get access to

763
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
commercial coherent transmission so what

764
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,200
is coherent it just means anything to do

765
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,799
with phase

766
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,720
but in in terms of

767
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
the commercial definition that we use

768
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,440
today we have phase modulation in the

769
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,520
transmitter phase modulation is more

770
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,760
tolerant to optical impairments and you

771
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,480
can put more bits into each modulation

772
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,120
symbol so if you if you're modulating at

773
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
the same board rate you're now carrying

774
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,679
more bits per second

775
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,159
you have a coherent detector as well in

776
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,080
the receiver it's now a linear detector

777
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,240
so that's really good because we can now

778
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,200
apply

779
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,679
powerful digital signal processing to

780
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,320
compensate for linear impairments

781
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
and it also includes a laser in the

782
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,399
receiver it's called the local

783
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,039
oscillator laser and that acts as a very

784
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,039
low noise amplifier in the receiver

785
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,440
and finally we have this magical digital

786
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
signal processing initially it was only

787
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,320
in the receiver but in in the last few

788
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,559
generations of coherent it's been in the

789
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,760
transmitter and the receiver and we can

790
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,159
compensate for linear impairments we can

791
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,320
compensate to some extent for non-linear

792
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
impairments that's a bit harder it's

793
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,720
very computationally intensive

794
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,480
but we can do a little bit of nonlinear

795
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,200
processing and lots of other

796
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,440
processing options in fact i'd like to

797
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,919
give you an example you could do at home

798
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,679
of how to encode a digital signal using

799
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,720
phase

800
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,559
so here is the digital signal that we

801
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,679
want to encode one zero zero one now

802
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,159
what could we um what could we do well

803
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,120
if we assume that in phase is a one an

804
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,840
outer phase is a zero what household

805
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
item

806
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,080
has phase as a property

807
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,600
toilet rolls

808
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,960
right so

809
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,080
if you notice a toilet roll has two two

810
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,840
layers right two plies

811
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,520
and sometimes you look and at the

812
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
perforation the two plies line up

813
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,039
and sometimes they don't

814
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,360
and here is an important tip if you want

815
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,080
to convert between outer phase to in

816
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,960
phase you just take the outer ply you

817
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,279
pull it round and then rip off at the

818
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,520
nearest perforation now you've you've

819
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,720
changed between in phase to outer phase

820
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,520
so you could arrange four toilet rolls

821
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,919
and have a four bit signal that you're

822
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,240
carrying now that that's not exactly

823
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,679
practical for a high speed internet

824
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,200
connection um so what we tend to use are

825
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,240
modulation constellations so here's

826
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,000
here's an example of some modulation

827
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
constellations this is a really simple

828
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
one instead of two phase states

829
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,480
we now have four phase states

830
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,120
uh and um you'll you'll notice the four

831
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,320
dots each one of those dots represents

832
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,159
two bits

833
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,840
and if we

834
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,240
send them send one of those modulations

835
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,640
on the x polarization and send a

836
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,120
different one on the y polarization we

837
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,760
now have four bits in each modulation

838
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,320
symbol and we call this polarization

839
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,120
multiplexed qpsk quadrature phase shift

840
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,720
keying

841
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,799
and the great thing is we can now put

842
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,640
more and more symbols into the

843
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
constellation

844
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,880
so we have eight quan 16 qualm 32 quan

845
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,320
64 quan

846
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,440
and

847
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,320
the difference between polmark's uh qpsk

848
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,559
which carries four bits per symbol with

849
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
the x and y polarizations

850
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,080
up to uh polmark 64 kwam that carries 12

851
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,320
bits per symbol

852
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
on the two polarizations so as we

853
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,840
increase up to up to that high order

854
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,320
modulation we actually multiply the

855
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,799
spectral efficiency and potentially the

856
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,200
capacity of the fiber pair by a factor

857
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,320
of three so you'll say my goodness

858
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,919
uh i i want to use 64 qam everywhere

859
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,720
you might not because you also have a 30

860
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,039
times reduction in optical reach when

861
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,720
you move to this higher higher order

862
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,840
modulation

863
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,399
uh and you you can kind of see why i i

864
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,279
mean i

865
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,679
uh if you look at at the 64 qualm

866
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,039
constellation

867
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,919
any adjacent symbols look very very

868
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,960
similar

869
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,919
whereas if you look at qpsk the adjacent

870
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,640
symbols are on literally opposite sides

871
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,440
of the uh of the constellation so it's a

872
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,240
lot harder to differentiate adjacent

873
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,360
symbols with 64 qualm than it is with

874
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,080
qpsk that's one of the reasons why

875
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,039
you end up with a shorter reach

876
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,840
but the five generations of coherent

877
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,440
transponders that we've seen in the

878
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,399
industry so far uh have actually

879
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,720
exploited this ability to operate with

880
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,120
more sophisticated constellations and

881
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,919
run at higher board rates so

882
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,679
this is roughly the date of commercial

883
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,039
availability

884
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,440
and then you see that we we've moved

885
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,039
from the first generation which could

886
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,000
only run at a 32 gigaboard with qpsk

887
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,440
right through to today's fifth

888
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,399
generation which uh even uses a very

889
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,559
special kind of modulation called

890
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,200
probabilistic constellation shaping

891
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,919
and at 100 gigaboard

892
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,159
data rates so

893
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,399
on the bottom line you can see the

894
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,960
enabling technology that allowed us to

895
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,360
do that which is that the feature size

896
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,840
of the asic technology drops from about

897
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,399
65 nanometers right down to today's

898
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,559
seven nanometer technology now your

899
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,880
iphones are already using five nanometer

900
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,640
technology but there's always a bit of a

901
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,600
delay getting from consumer devices into

902
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,919
embedded devices like transponders but

903
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,000
five nanometer and then three nanometer

904
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
uh would be the next steps

905
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
these are the performance

906
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,918
uh uh boosts that we get

907
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,399
rising from about 40 gig per wavelength

908
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,800
uh with the first generation up to 800

909
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,280
gigabits per second per wavelength uh on

910
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
today's technology

911
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,639
and c-band capacity rising from eight

912
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,599
terabytes uh right up to 42 terabytes

913
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,440
now in the extended c-band

914
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
and there are lots of other features in

915
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,040
transponders that i don't really have

916
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,960
time to talk about these would require

917
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,679
an entire separate tutorial they're all

918
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,399
about improving optical performance

919
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,639
right that's how you get to this 42

920
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,440
terabits in the c band 80 terabits or so

921
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,480
in the c plus l bands

922
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,000
and the transponder performance

923
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,239
evolution has really

924
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,119
carried us through from direct detect

925
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,119
right through to the coherent uh

926
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,200
detection generations

927
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,079
and the wavelength data rate increase i

928
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,680
calculated is a 320 times increase and

929
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,079
the c band capacity increase is

930
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,920
somewhere over 200

931
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,480
times increase so we've we've done well

932
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,280
over the last few years

933
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,359
so a trans summary of the transponder

934
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,440
evolution coherent transponders have

935
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,599
certainly revolutionized long-haul

936
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,280
transmission we're in the fifth

937
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,800
generation of that uh today with 800 gig

938
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,839
generation historically transponder

939
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,160
upgrades were the easiest way to

940
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,480
increase fiber capacity on existing

941
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
routes remember my three levels of

942
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
options right this is option one you're

943
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,079
in you're following the transponder

944
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,320
evolution curve you don't have to change

945
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
your optical fiber you don't have to

946
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,160
change your line systems

947
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,920
coherent performance is predominantly

948
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,760
driven by asic technology and also by uh

949
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,079
the the quality of the modulators we're

950
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,800
currently on seven nanometer a6 uh the

951
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,640
next stages are five nanometer then

952
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,760
three nanometer and we're starting to

953
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,040
max out in terms of capacity uh

954
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,440
limits in the fiber but what we can

955
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,000
still do with transponder evolution is

956
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,680
give you higher wavelength data rates

957
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,079
at a given optical reach

958
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,359
because that will

959
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,119
positively affect your network economics

960
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,760
so independently we can expect optical

961
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,400
performance in plugable form factors to

962
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,960
improve dramatically because right now

963
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,119
the the high performance transponders

964
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,119
are not in a plugable form factor

965
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,359
they're in a larger form factor where we

966
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,880
don't need to worry about power

967
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
consumption we don't need to worry about

968
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,040
heat dissipation it's all about optical

969
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
performance but if you want to fit in a

970
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,280
pluggable form factor you have to stay

971
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,400
within the

972
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,160
power consumption of that of the of the

973
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,800
msa you know the spec for the uh for the

974
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,040
plugable and also the heat dissipation

975
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,960
for for that so

976
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,400
pluggable performance is going to

977
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,599
improve over the next few years

978
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,520
what about the interaction between the

979
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,880
fiber and the transponders so

980
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,720
one of the interesting things is that

981
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,440
optical fiber has evolved

982
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,839
over the years and it was always in

983
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,160
search of the perfect fiber for the

984
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,079
transponders that were available at that

985
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:20,960
time

986
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,560
many of us will be familiar with good

987
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,320
old g652

988
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,160
fiber which was

989
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,480
so the dates i'm using here are the

990
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,280
dates of the itu specifications for

991
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,640
those fiber types so g652 was specified

992
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,200
in 1984.

993
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,680
this is the perfect fiber for single

994
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,280
wavelength operation at 13 10 nanometers

995
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,200
because guess what the si the single

996
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,599
mode uh or the fiber lasers that we

997
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,400
could

998
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,480
sorry the lasers that we could build

999
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,920
uh back in 1984 operated at 13 10

1000
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,000
nanometers we couldn't build longer

1001
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,160
wavelength lasers at that point well we

1002
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,839
could in a lab but not you know not

1003
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,880
commercially for uh telecoms purposes

1004
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,520
but then what happens um

1005
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,240
somebody says oh we can now build lasers

1006
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,079
at 1550 nanometers and it turns out the

1007
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,720
g652 has very high chromatic dispersion

1008
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,520
at 50 and 50 nanometers so somebody

1009
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,400
invents g653 fiber and that's the

1010
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,680
perfect fiber for single 2.5 gig

1011
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,800
wavelengths at 1550 nanometers

1012
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,520
it has zero dispersion at 1550

1013
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
nanometers

1014
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,760
so then we have uh another version of

1015
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,160
fiber that comes out g655

1016
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,880
which is the perfect fiber for single 10

1017
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,480
gig wavelengths at 1550 nanometers so

1018
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,960
all of these are essentially predating

1019
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,640
dwdm

1020
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,400
once dwdm comes along that g655 fiber

1021
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,320
and the g653 fibers they look very bad

1022
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,480
in terms of their non-linear performance

1023
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,280
because once we start putting edfas

1024
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
into the fiber chain we're boosting the

1025
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
optical power levels so much we could

1026
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,520
easily trigger non-linear effects

1027
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,320
so

1028
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,640
uh g655 leaf

1029
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,280
uh is invented as the perfect fiber for

1030
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,280
dwdm 10 gig at 15 50 nanometers

1031
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,000
so

1032
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,839
this is for 10 gig transmission now it's

1033
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,920
not for coherent transmission so the

1034
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,400
question arises which is the best of

1035
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,640
these fibers for modern coherent

1036
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,440
transmission and in fact we oops we have

1037
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,359
a winner

1038
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,720
with good old g652 because if you look

1039
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,480
at all the properties

1040
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,560
that these different fibers have

1041
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,200
effective area and chromatic dispersion

1042
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,040
in order to minimize non-linear

1043
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,680
penalties we need a high effective area

1044
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,920
and we need a high chromatic dispersion

1045
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
well now that we're using coherent

1046
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,079
transponders we can compensate for high

1047
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,800
chromatic dispersion so we we don't mind

1048
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,599
the high chromatic dispersion in a g652

1049
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,320
fiber it's quite ironic that the oldest

1050
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,800
kind of fiber single mode fiber around

1051
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,880
is actually one of the best fibers for

1052
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,560
coherent transmission

1053
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,720
although of course it would now be more

1054
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,520
modern g652 fiber

1055
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,960
you know it

1056
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,040
apparently about 90 percent of the fiber

1057
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,319
in the world is g652 so that's probably

1058
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,240
very good news

1059
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,160
we have new commercially available fiber

1060
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,400
types with with uh ultra low loss g652

1061
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,800
there's a large effective area

1062
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,520
family of fibers g654 fibers

1063
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,400
um

1064
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,319
they're used in some submarine cables

1065
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,160
there are terrestrial network variants

1066
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,720
of these the larger effective area means

1067
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,280
you have a lower non-linear penalty

1068
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,119
roman amplifiers don't work quite so

1069
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,800
well on those large area fibers but

1070
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,240
they're not bad

1071
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,079
so that's an option as well

1072
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,240
and there's a lot of work on reducing

1073
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,040
the outer diameter cladding diameter on

1074
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,319
fibers so that you can fit more fibers

1075
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,960
into a bundle a cable bundle

1076
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,359
a 20 reduction in cladding diameter

1077
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,000
gives you a 50 increase in in fiber

1078
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,319
pairs

1079
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,400
so how far can we push capacity on

1080
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,560
existing fiber using existing line

1081
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,960
systems only changing the transponders

1082
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,240
well really

1083
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
we're kind of almost there um line

1084
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,160
systems that are commercially available

1085
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,000
today you're looking at about 40

1086
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,319
terabits in the c-band and 40 terabits

1087
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,000
in the l band

1088
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,040
moving to super c and super l will

1089
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,280
increase that by about 25 percent in

1090
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,359
each of the bands so you've got 50

1091
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,160
terabits in your c bar super c band 50

1092
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,560
terabits in your super l band

1093
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,520
and

1094
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,960
beyond that we're getting closer and

1095
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,880
closer to the practical limits but there

1096
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,720
is some gas left in the tank in terms of

1097
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,240
increasing the wavelength data rates

1098
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
capacity at longer reaches

1099
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,200
um

1100
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,760
is interesting because the those

1101
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,119
capacity numbers that i've just been

1102
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,280
talking about will give you an optical

1103
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,240
reach of about a thousand kilometers

1104
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,319
if you need to go further let's say 3

1105
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,640
000 kilometers you'll reduce the

1106
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,480
capacity of your fiber down to about 75

1107
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,000
terabits per second across those two

1108
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,480
bands and then if you go ultra long haul

1109
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,560
distances you'll drop to about 50

1110
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,520
terabits per second

1111
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,040
so can we transmit in other wave bands

1112
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,200
in order to increase fiber capacity and

1113
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,480
the answer is yes

1114
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,880
but it's it's not really for increased

1115
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,599
capacity that we're using it today

1116
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,240
i've been describing dense wavelength

1117
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,160
division multiplexing dwdm and in dwdm

1118
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,760
we have to

1119
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,400
wavelength lock our lasers we use a

1120
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,560
active cooling on the lasers to make

1121
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,400
sure the lasers stay on that same

1122
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,680
wavelength

1123
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,160
that is more expensive than something

1124
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,599
like coarse wdm where you don't have

1125
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,200
these cooled lasers they're just free

1126
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,359
running lasers and they wobble about a

1127
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,240
bit

1128
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,920
so because you know that they wobble

1129
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,000
about a bit you make sure there's lots

1130
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,400
of space between adjacent channels

1131
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,200
in course wdm but you're using all of

1132
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,680
the other wave bands the o band e band s

1133
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
band uh

1134
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,160
of the of the optical fiber but the the

1135
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,920
reach is a lot shorter because remember

1136
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,640
the attenuation in those other bands is

1137
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,839
much higher so we use cwdm because it's

1138
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,880
cheap not because of additional capacity

1139
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,359
and it's typically a 10 gig per channel

1140
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,119
only a few channels

1141
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,359
and it's used in unamplified short

1142
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,240
distance applications

1143
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,480
but it is proof that we could use these

1144
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,800
other bands in other words we can build

1145
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,520
lasers that can transmit across any of

1146
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,000
these bands

1147
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,680
these optical fiber wave bands

1148
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,400
essentially evolved as laser technology

1149
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,240
did the very first lasers we could build

1150
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,480
operated at the very edge of the visible

1151
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,520
spectrum at 860 nanometers then we had

1152
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,599
1310 nanometers and then we had 1550

1153
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,000
nanometer lasers so we can build lasers

1154
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,960
across any of these wavelengths and

1155
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,119
today of course we operate in the c and

1156
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,480
l bands

1157
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,520
and we solve for attenuation uh

1158
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,359
even at this very low level attenuation

1159
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,359
we solve for attenuation using

1160
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,119
amplification

1161
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,960
and we can amplify

1162
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,079
in these other wave bands as well

1163
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,640
and so here's our attenuation

1164
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,960
curve for optical fiber

1165
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,599
and by changing the kind of doping

1166
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,480
element that that we're using we can

1167
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,400
amplify in different bands so in the c

1168
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,200
and the l bands we're using erbium

1169
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,839
in the s band we use thulium which is a

1170
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,560
different rare earth element in the e

1171
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,359
band we use neodymium and in the o-band

1172
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,040
we use prizodymium

1173
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,160
now

1174
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,079
none of these amplifiers are

1175
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,800
commercially available what happens is

1176
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,240
that academic

1177
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,960
researchers have demonstrated that they

1178
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,560
can amplify across these other bands so

1179
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,839
these will all cost more per gigabit per

1180
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,240
second per kilometer than a c or an

1181
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,040
l-band system and i see that as the real

1182
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,160
problem of multi-band communication

1183
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,400
because um the other

1184
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,160
the other funny thing about

1185
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,160
these other bands the black line or i

1186
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,240
think it's black black line that i

1187
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,880
drew there that is the dispersion

1188
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,440
profile of uh fiber

1189
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,640
chromatic dispersion is much lower

1190
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,200
and also the effective area of the fiber

1191
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,760
the same fiber has a lower effective

1192
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,040
area because effective area has a

1193
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,200
wavelength dependency

1194
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,680
at these lower shorter wavelengths which

1195
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,440
means that your non-linear penalties are

1196
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,640
much higher

1197
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,640
at these shorter wavelengths which is a

1198
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,560
bad thing

1199
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,400
so if you think about wideband

1200
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,800
communication applying that to the

1201
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,520
networks that you already have installed

1202
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,680
you've already established the spacing

1203
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,839
between your amplifier sites

1204
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,440
you can't really move them closer

1205
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,880
together

1206
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,839
so optical performance is set by the

1207
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,160
performance in the c and the l bands

1208
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,760
and the other wave bands they have

1209
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,680
higher attenuation

1210
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,599
and it would mean you know you move your

1211
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,280
amp sites closer together or you accept

1212
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,520
lower data rates per wavelength in order

1213
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
to close that link with the same

1214
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,520
amplifier spacing well that's going to

1215
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,160
cost you more per gigabit per second so

1216
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,800
i i think there's potentially

1217
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
a much simpler solution in a lot of

1218
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,040
terrestrial networks and that is more

1219
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,400
fiber pairs

1220
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,040
so if you if you think most operators

1221
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,760
today use one and a quarter inch ducts

1222
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,040
for their fiber

1223
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,520
and historically the limit of the number

1224
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
of fiber pairs inducts like that would

1225
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,160
be 864 fibre pairs but today you can buy

1226
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,319
1728

1227
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,079
fiber pairs for a 1.25 inch duct so

1228
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,760
that's a that's a really straightforward

1229
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,400
solution to increase capacity and of

1230
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,160
course it's just regular fiber that

1231
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,560
you'd use in the c and the l bands so

1232
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,960
it's you know very straightforward to uh

1233
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,760
uh to increase capacity if you have two

1234
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,520
inch dots like a lot of the data center

1235
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,960
operators uh are installing you can buy

1236
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,200
six thousand nine hundred and twelve

1237
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,880
pair uh uh cables these days which is an

1238
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,520
astonishing amount of capacity

1239
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,119
so what have we learned about fiber so

1240
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,760
far uh minimum fiber attenuation is in

1241
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,839
the c and the l bands we could use other

1242
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,319
bands but they're going to cost us more

1243
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,520
um

1244
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,359
wideband wideband transmission has been

1245
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,200
proven by uh of course wdm but cwdm is

1246
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,040
not used for higher capacity it's

1247
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,720
because it's cheap

1248
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,599
fiber design has also evolved to match

1249
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,079
optical transponder capabilities

1250
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,640
as wavelengths as lasers were available

1251
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,760
at longer wavelengths as we move to dwdm

1252
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,960
and as as we use optical amplifiers but

1253
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,040
good old g652 fiber is still the best uh

1254
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,520
or is a very good fiber for modern

1255
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,440
coherent transmission

1256
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,200
and more fiber pairs are a quick and

1257
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,319
easy way

1258
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,800
to increase capacity

1259
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,160
now

1260
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,319
we we really need to start looking at

1261
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,240
other fiber types and i i have a special

1262
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,720
mention here of a fiber type called zb

1263
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,680
lan

1264
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,000
and it's called zb land because

1265
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,119
uh it's an exotic mix of these fluorides

1266
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,880
zirconium business bismuth lanthanum uh

1267
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,720
it's written down here aluminum but i

1268
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,200
would call it aluminium uh and sodium

1269
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,960
which is a chemical symbol is na so

1270
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,720
that's where you get the zblan

1271
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,680
uh

1272
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,960
name from

1273
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,280
um it's generally today not used for

1274
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,079
transmission fiber cb land is designed

1275
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,240
for things like gratings and and gain

1276
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,800
fibers and so on but people have

1277
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,200
actually um

1278
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,599
made experimental lengths of zb land

1279
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,200
fiber and found that it has a very wide

1280
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,160
bandwidth compared to silica based fiber

1281
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,480
uh and and good non-linear performance

1282
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,960
as well sounds fantastic

1283
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,040
the bad news is it has to be made in

1284
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,400
zero gravity

1285
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,480
uh this is one of the experiments that

1286
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,240
was taken up to the international space

1287
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,319
station um and unless we can find a way

1288
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,480
to to sort of get it's all about the

1289
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,200
crystalline structure within the zbland

1290
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,920
uh fiber itself unless we can find a way

1291
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,240
to to make it on earth i don't think

1292
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,200
this is really a a viable option

1293
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,119
uh can we really make you know tens of

1294
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,960
millions of kilometers of that

1295
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,720
well maybe

1296
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,720
so let's move on to another approach

1297
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,359
which is few mode fiber so remember i

1298
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,079
said that normal optical fiber is single

1299
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,319
mode but if we make the core of the

1300
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,640
fiber a little bit wider instead of

1301
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,880
there just being room for one mode we

1302
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,079
may have room for multiple modes

1303
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,960
and these modes actually do take

1304
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,680
different path lengths along the fiber

1305
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,760
uh and one of the problems is that

1306
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,920
you'll end up with lots of crosstalk

1307
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,760
uh between these modes

1308
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,839
because of modal dispersion and you have

1309
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,800
to figure out what to do you know how to

1310
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,960
unscramble these signals but we can do

1311
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
it uh the technologies some of you in

1312
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,079
the uh uh 5g

1313
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,559
area may be aware of memo technology

1314
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,559
from multiple aerials

1315
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,720
it's an established technology

1316
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,960
so we could do it but it would mean the

1317
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,280
development of specialist memos for

1318
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,119
transponders

1319
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,960
and the initial experimental results are

1320
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,040
looking like two to three times the

1321
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,680
capacity compared with a single mode

1322
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,640
system

1323
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,040
and you could probably use a lot of the

1324
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,280
existing technologies for amplification

1325
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,400
and so on

1326
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,800
but it does require new fiber single

1327
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,960
mode fiber doesn't work this way you

1328
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,839
have to

1329
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,400
use few mode fiber

1330
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,599
what about multi-core fiber so this is a

1331
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,680
really interesting option when you

1332
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,640
consider the size of these structures it

1333
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,960
really is a form of nano engineering i

1334
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,760
think

1335
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,359
it's a fiber that's designed to have

1336
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,079
multiple cores within the same cladding

1337
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,160
and this is a form of space division

1338
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,839
multiplexing because we're we're

1339
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,920
transmitting across multiple fiber cores

1340
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,800
here

1341
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,280
and the capacity of the fiber is now

1342
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,200
multiplied by the number of cores which

1343
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,359
is sounds like a good return

1344
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,400
so

1345
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
there are generally speaking two types

1346
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,520
of multi-core fiber uncoupled and

1347
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
coupled core i'm going to look at the

1348
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,400
transmitter and receiver impact first

1349
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,280
for uncoupled what we mean here is that

1350
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,400
there is no interaction between signals

1351
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
in the different cores they just travel

1352
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,520
in parallel uh and that means that that

1353
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,319
uh you don't need any kind of uh memo

1354
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,000
for compensation you don't need to

1355
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,440
unscramble the signals at the other end

1356
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,880
with coupled multi-core fiber you do get

1357
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,119
a crosstalk between the cores

1358
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,440
it's designed that way and

1359
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,520
it means that the receiver essentially

1360
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,000
you've got a scrambled mix of of the

1361
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,319
signals on the two cores and you need to

1362
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,640
have one of these memos and a digital

1363
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,760
signal processor to separate the two

1364
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,000
or more signal streams

1365
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,280
so that's at the transmitter and

1366
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,440
receiver and you can you can probably

1367
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,280
agree with me that

1368
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,200
uncoupled clearly has an advantage here

1369
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,119
because we don't need to develop new

1370
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,520
transponder technology well what about

1371
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,119
amplifier sites

1372
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,280
well at the amplifier sites with

1373
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,160
uncoupled uh multi-core you actually

1374
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,920
have to fan out the the different cores

1375
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,480
amplify them in their own ad furs and

1376
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,599
then fan them back in to the to the uh

1377
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,960
next hop fiber so

1378
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,359
with coupled multi-core

1379
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,359
people haven't really got this to work

1380
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,520
yet but the the thought is you could

1381
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,880
have a single ad fur that will amplify

1382
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,920
um all of the different cores so i think

1383
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,319
at the amplifier sites we could agree

1384
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,559
that coupled multi-core fiber has an

1385
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,079
advantage

1386
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:52,800
so

1387
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,319
you know there are pros and cons for

1388
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,920
each of them so if we think about the

1389
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,359
likely scenarios here the the challenges

1390
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,720
here when you talk to fiber

1391
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
manufacturers they talk about

1392
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,280
potentially having very low yields

1393
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,520
because if you make multiple cores in

1394
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,160
the fiber you can find you have a bad

1395
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,480
one of the cause being bad

1396
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,640
but you just have to throw the whole

1397
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,359
fiber away you can't you you know like

1398
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,200
uh intel used to make multi-core

1399
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,839
processors and they have bad cores and

1400
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,760
you could just turn that core off and

1401
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,599
sell the processor anyway you can't

1402
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,520
really do that with with multi-core

1403
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,720
fiber

1404
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,559
in terrestrial networks i don't think

1405
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,040
there's a practical use case uh here for

1406
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,880
multi-core fiber

1407
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,200
unless space in the duct eventually

1408
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,800
becomes a problem

1409
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,880
because large fiber count cables seem to

1410
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,359
be a much more straightforward uh

1411
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,760
approach to uh to solving the problem

1412
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,000
now in submarine networks the this is a

1413
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,760
different story i've got a section at

1414
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,559
the end specifically on sub c there may

1415
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,400
be a use case for two core and four core

1416
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,720
fibers the reason i limit it to four

1417
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,000
cores once you go above four cores all

1418
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,319
multi-core fiber becomes coupled

1419
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,800
but at four core and two core you can

1420
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,200
design uncoupled cores and the likely

1421
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,359
time frame for that has to be beyond

1422
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,599
say three to five years because if you

1423
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,520
talk to the manufacturers of submarine

1424
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,640
cables none of their road maps involve

1425
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,440
multi-core fiber today

1426
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,640
so the good news is with uncoupled uh

1427
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,559
multi-core fiber there's no need to to

1428
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,319
change any existing transponders they'll

1429
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,960
work uh on the multi-core fiber but

1430
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,200
coupled core multicore fiber is going to

1431
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,040
need new transponder designs

1432
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,119
right moving away again from

1433
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,599
conventional fiber this time to hollow

1434
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,400
core fiber because what have i told you

1435
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,880
so far about glass core fiber well the

1436
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,440
fiber acts as a waveguide it's single

1437
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,079
mode operation and the attenuation

1438
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,000
varies with wavelength

1439
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,680
today's optical communication is in the

1440
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,359
c and the l bands that's one of the

1441
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,240
things that limits fiber capacity but

1442
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,559
there's so much more potential capacity

1443
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,520
in the fiber because we can build lasers

1444
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,280
over a much wider range of wavelengths

1445
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,280
glass is a non-linear medium which is

1446
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,960
also a limiting factor because that

1447
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,119
limits the optical power you can put

1448
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,280
into the fiber if we could transmit at

1449
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,920
higher power levels we could go further

1450
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,400
and at higher data rates

1451
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,839
glass core fiber has a higher latency

1452
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,839
than transmission through air because

1453
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,079
glass has a refractive index of about

1454
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,200
1.5 air is very close to one it's almost

1455
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,880
the same as a vacuum

1456
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,440
now that's an entirely separate issue

1457
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,839
from capacity it's about low latency

1458
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,079
communication

1459
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,079
which means that

1460
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,720
a wider bandwidth waveguide would allow

1461
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,799
us to increase capacity reach

1462
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,640
a waveguide that had more linear

1463
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,880
performance would allow us to increase

1464
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,240
capacity reach

1465
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,040
and as a separate market driver

1466
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,799
it would be great to find a waveguide

1467
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,520
that has lower latency than glass

1468
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,319
all of these are limitations that come

1469
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,440
from using

1470
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,160
glass as the transmission medium

1471
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,640
so what happens if you don't what

1472
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,359
happens if you build a hollow core

1473
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,599
optical fiber now the potential

1474
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,640
advantages uh it because we're really

1475
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,720
transmitting in air although the latest

1476
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,599
uh i think fibers are actually um

1477
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,040
using a vacuum uh in in the in the fiber

1478
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,920
wideband transmission because we're not

1479
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,680
transmitting glass anymore lower

1480
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,400
non-linear effects may be much lower

1481
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,920
non-linear effects people have talked

1482
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,480
about several orders of magnitude

1483
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,640
lower nonlinear effects and lower

1484
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,000
latency so how's it work

1485
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,599
well the first thing we've got to figure

1486
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,079
out is how to create that waveguide

1487
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,040
principle how to trap the light within

1488
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,119
the optical fiber so

1489
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,599
the the very first holocore fiber used a

1490
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,520
technique called photonic bandgap so

1491
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,480
that was back in around about 1991

1492
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,200
now

1493
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,720
i'm not going to explain these

1494
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,680
techniques it's quite complicated but

1495
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,760
photonic bandgap seems to be falling out

1496
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,880
of favor

1497
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,720
favor at the moment it's at a bit of a

1498
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,400
technology dead end

1499
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,359
because we can't get the attenuation of

1500
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,480
photonic band gap fiber low enough

1501
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,359
so instead an approach that that first

1502
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,480
uh was was proposed in 2011

1503
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,880
is using an anti-resonant effect as the

1504
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,359
as the containment uh and and the most

1505
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:34,000
advanced fiber today is known as dual

1506
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,880
nested anti-resonant nodeless fiber or

1507
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,559
nymph or dnamp uh which is uh this is

1508
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,040
the record uh holder at the moment and

1509
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,440
it's mostly a great british invention uh

1510
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,599
i say mostly because although the the

1511
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,359
very first paper was proposed at the

1512
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,760
university of bath in 1991 that's on

1513
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,839
photonic bandgap uh fiber the first uh

1514
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,280
anti-resonant fiber was actually

1515
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,200
proposed by uh andrei uh primakov at the

1516
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,439
um

1517
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,599
it was the russian academy of sciences

1518
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,839
so so he actually came up with the idea

1519
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,240
of anti-resonance but all the latest

1520
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,480
developments in anti-resonance have been

1521
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,280
at southampton university in in the uk

1522
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,079
and they've now been commercialized um

1523
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,640
another evolutionary view the top line

1524
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,760
is showing the structural evolution from

1525
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,760
photonic band gaps with lots and lots of

1526
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,040
little honeycombs through to uh

1527
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,280
anti-resonant uh structures but then the

1528
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,359
bottom line is where they discovered

1529
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,920
this nested structure idea

1530
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,880
and it's just scary actually how

1531
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,200
tiny these structures are if we look at

1532
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,319
that uh that bottom right one the

1533
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,160
you can see those circles these are

1534
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,920
actually uh

1535
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,520
tubes of glass

1536
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,319
through the the fiber itself the outer

1537
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:56,640
diameter is classic 125 micron fiber the

1538
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,359
larger tubes on the inner uh

1539
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,359
structure are are

1540
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,040
i think they're what are they about 30

1541
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,440
microns and the smaller tubes are about

1542
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,839
10 microns in diameter

1543
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,079
and what they do they tune the relative

1544
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,240
sizes of these to reduce uh attenuation

1545
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,680
at different wavelengths so those

1546
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,400
structures are very precise as well as

1547
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,960
being um tiny

1548
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,720
so the big news that was announced at

1549
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,799
ofc earlier this year is that this

1550
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,799
company luminos luminosity which is

1551
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:27,839
actually the

1552
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,839
commercial spin out from southampton

1553
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,599
university have announced this

1554
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:36,079
incredibly low attenuation uh d9 fiber

1555
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,079
0.22 db per kilometer at 1310 nanometers

1556
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,720
and less than 0.18 db per kilometer at

1557
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,359
1550 well that compares with regular smf

1558
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,559
uh

1559
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,880
now you'll see smf is has a much higher

1560
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,760
attenuation at 13 10 nanometers

1561
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,680
um and it has a slightly higher

1562
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,559
attenuation at 1550. if you look at smf

1563
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,960
28 ultra low loss

1564
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,960
it's still higher attenuation at 13 10

1565
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,319
nanometers it's almost the same at 1550

1566
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,799
so we're getting a fiber now that is

1567
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:12,640
performing not only as well as smf 28

1568
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,119
ultra low loss but also

1569
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,359
over a much wider band of of wavelengths

1570
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,880
so this this is really where we're

1571
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,440
getting the additional uh spectrum from

1572
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,920
with um hollow core fiber

1573
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,240
and this gives you an indication of uh

1574
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,760
latency changes glass core versus uh air

1575
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,799
core fibers uh and um

1576
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,359
so so basically you're you're dropping

1577
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,839
from just under five microseconds per

1578
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,480
kilometer uh of latency

1579
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,559
in glass core fiber to about three and a

1580
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,200
third microseconds per kilometer so it's

1581
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:47,839
a

1582
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,799
it's a decent reduction in latency now

1583
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,359
the pros and cons the likely scenarios

1584
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,839
will clearly hollow core fiber

1585
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,240
offers some a number of advantages over

1586
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,559
glass core fiber lower latency over a

1587
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,040
wider band of wavelengths the other

1588
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,119
thing to uh

1589
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,640
to mention about the lower attenuation

1590
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,680
is that glass core fiber is approaching

1591
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,960
its theoretical minimum attenuation

1592
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,280
whereas hollow core fiber is nowhere

1593
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,000
near its minimum theoretical minimum

1594
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,960
attenuation so potentially we could have

1595
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,960
a couple of orders of magnitude more

1596
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,319
reduction in uh attenuation in this

1597
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,359
fiber

1598
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:30,960
so

1599
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,640
there are no modifications needed to the

1600
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,000
transponders you can use regular

1601
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,200
transponders

1602
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,319
and

1603
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,720
the big question can you manufacture it

1604
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,760
you saw

1605
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,079
the intricacy of those structures

1606
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,200
um

1607
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,799
you know can you manufacture at high

1608
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,440
yields how much will it cost if you you

1609
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,240
know if you can manufacture this fiber

1610
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,680
will it be

1611
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,480
really usable and durable in real

1612
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,680
deployments uh including subsea what

1613
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,359
happens if

1614
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:02,559
uh a hollow core fiber that has a vacuum

1615
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,520
inside the fiber has a cable break under

1616
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,640
the ocean

1617
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,720
you've now got three or four thousand

1618
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,440
kilometers of fiber full of sea water

1619
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,280
so that's probably not an ideal

1620
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,880
situation i don't know how you you kind

1621
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,280
of recover from that

1622
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,280
will existing amplifiers work on hollow

1623
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,359
core fiber all of the uh trials of

1624
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,960
hollow core fiber today have been

1625
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,319
unamplified

1626
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,400
uh and you know how can we repair these

1627
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,640
fibers you know if you're in

1628
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,119
the back of a truck on a rainy day next

1629
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,680
to a freeway and you're repairing hollow

1630
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,599
core fiber how long is it going to take

1631
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,280
you how many times you've got a have you

1632
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,160
got a

1633
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,559
fusion splice that fiber before you get

1634
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,200
a good splice

1635
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,359
so a special topic here

1636
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,400
is submarine cable capacity because the

1637
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,880
biggest difference between terrestrial

1638
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,880
and subsea is

1639
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,240
power supplies in a terrestrial network

1640
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,720
you have amplifier sites but you also

1641
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,599
have

1642
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,520
mains electricity at those amplifier

1643
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,079
sites you can put electricity in at all

1644
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,839
of those amp sites you may not be able

1645
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,839
to put as much as you want but you can

1646
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:08,720
put it

1647
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,240
in all of these sites

1648
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,720
in a submarine cable you can only put

1649
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,680
the power in at the ends of the cable

1650
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,440
so if you have a six thousand six

1651
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,039
hundred and fifty kilometer

1652
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,680
transatlantic cable you can only put the

1653
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,240
power in at the at the landing stations

1654
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,440
at either end and so at some point the

1655
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,160
conductor of that cable can only take a

1656
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,000
certain electrical load and that's

1657
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,079
what's limiting the number of fiber

1658
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,039
pairs that you can fit into a submarine

1659
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,039
cable these days

1660
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,079
so capacity expansion the approach in

1661
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,440
submarine cables is to focus now on the

1662
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,400
total cable capacity previously and

1663
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,200
until very recently the focus was on

1664
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,119
fiber pair capacity

1665
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,559
so what happens

1666
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:55,839
is that by

1667
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:58,400
tuning for wider amplifier spacing in

1668
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,680
the in the cable

1669
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,559
lower amplifier power uh you can also do

1670
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,319
sharing of your backup pump lasers

1671
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,160
because remember these amplifiers in a

1672
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,160
submarine cable they live under the

1673
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,760
ocean for 25 years so if your amplifier

1674
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,119
amplifier pump lasers uh burn out

1675
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,359
you you can't lift the cable and replace

1676
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,359
the amplifier housing that's very bad

1677
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,359
that's very expensive what you do you

1678
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,720
put backup lasers in those housings and

1679
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,200
normally it's one for one backups which

1680
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,440
uses a lot more power but if you can

1681
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,079
find ways to share backup pumps between

1682
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,760
all the different fiber pairs you could

1683
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,000
economize on power

1684
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,680
and we refer to that it's an

1685
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,839
architectural design approach for

1686
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,079
submarine cables as space division

1687
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,559
multiplexing so if you ever he if you

1688
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,520
listen to a a submarine uh presentation

1689
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,319
you'll now hear about sdn and sdm has

1690
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,520
its own roadmap of of developments

1691
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,359
so before sdm

1692
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,000
the maximum transatlantic cable capacity

1693
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,200
was about 250 terabits per second and

1694
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,960
that assumes fifth fifth generation

1695
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,960
transponders that will be a cable like

1696
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,559
the maria cable

1697
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,799
which is actually the highest performing

1698
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,039
cable from a per fiber pair point of

1699
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,359
view but the total cable capacity is not

1700
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,039
as much as

1701
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,359
more modern cables like the dunant cable

1702
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,520
which probably has about 300 terabits

1703
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,720
per second

1704
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,359
on 12 fiber pairs rather than eight on

1705
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,799
uh on maria

1706
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,359
there are there's a cable planned now

1707
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,559
transatlantic with 24 fiber pairs which

1708
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,480
would have about half a petabit per

1709
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,599
second

1710
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,319
of capacity and then we know how to

1711
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,119
build a transatlantic cable which could

1712
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,400
give a a one petabit uh capacity so

1713
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,240
that's not in planning at the moment but

1714
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,400
that all the technologies are lining up

1715
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,400
uh that that cable could be uh could be

1716
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,160
built

1717
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,799
so is there a fiber pair limit in

1718
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,960
submarine cables yes

1719
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,079
uh because um

1720
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,079
there's a limit so

1721
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,480
if you imagine submarine cables have to

1722
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,000
that i mean that there are they are

1723
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,039
engineering miracles they they live in

1724
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,760
incredible conditions salt water at

1725
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,039
massive pressure uh for 25 years

1726
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,839
the cable designs themselves have been

1727
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,559
certified in you know in similar ways to

1728
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,400
like satellite technology or space

1729
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,480
technologies they are very very highly

1730
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,680
certified

1731
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,440
there's only a certain number of fibre

1732
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,000
pairs you can fit into those

1733
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,760
tried and tested

1734
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,960
cable designs once you go beyond that

1735
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,160
you need to start developing those

1736
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,079
designs and that's non-trivial that that

1737
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,720
that's going to take a lot of testing

1738
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,280
and also the more fibre pairs you have

1739
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,559
in the cable

1740
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,160
um the

1741
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,440
the

1742
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,640
less

1743
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,599
cable

1744
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,520
a ship can carry

1745
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,200
in its hold and that's going to

1746
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,599
negatively affect your deployment

1747
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:54,799
economics

1748
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,720
uh there is another aspect as well if

1749
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,799
you have a lot more fiber pairs in a

1750
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,960
cable and you have a cable break it

1751
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,280
takes you longer to fix the cable

1752
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,680
so a lot of these uh are sort of

1753
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,920
pointing towards well maybe in instead

1754
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,880
of putting more fiber pairs maybe we use

1755
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,400
multi-core fiber

1756
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,000
so that's that's probably the driver

1757
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,559
behind the change to multi-core

1758
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,400
so future fiber types and submarine

1759
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,440
cables

1760
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,839
uh if you look at uh wet plant vendor

1761
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,039
road maps there are no new fiber types

1762
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,760
for the next two years so the current

1763
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,680
fiber types will deliver up to this one

1764
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,119
petabit uh transatlantic performance but

1765
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,760
beyond that i think we probably have to

1766
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,079
start looking at multi-core uncoupled

1767
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,359
fibers that would be a good next step

1768
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,599
and that solves for that cable diameter

1769
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,280
problem

1770
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,280
hollow core fiber it's a very

1771
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,119
interesting technology in submarine

1772
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,319
deployments

1773
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:51,760
because of the potential for higher

1774
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,440
capacity and much lower latency

1775
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,280
and it it potentially solves two

1776
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,440
problems at once but of course

1777
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,720
hollow core fiber uh at those pressures

1778
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,200
uh and what about if you have a vacuum

1779
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,760
uh in that fiber and it breaks and you

1780
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,520
know it it's there's a lot of question

1781
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,839
marks really to be answered there

1782
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:15,119
now um one of um meta's uh network

1783
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,880
architect submarine network architect dr

1784
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,198
steve grubb he actually has coined this

1785
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,839
term of neptune's law for transatlantic

1786
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,000
cables now similar to moore's law that

1787
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,359
this uh

1788
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,520
exponential rise so the two lines that

1789
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,799
are shown there

1790
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,279
are for cable capacity and the cost per

1791
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,319
gigabit per second so neptune's law says

1792
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,040
that submarine cable capacity roughly

1793
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,120
doubles every two years

1794
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,920
and that the cost per gigabit per second

1795
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,640
will halve every three years

1796
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,439
and

1797
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,439
you can see that there's a discontinuity

1798
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,479
there

1799
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,319
and the way that steve explains that

1800
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:52,479
discontinuity he says well you know you

1801
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,920
think about the timing of the dot-com

1802
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,120
collapse there wouldn't have been a lot

1803
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,000
of investment at that after that period

1804
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,399
uh in submarine cables

1805
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,359
so the slope to the left of the

1806
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:05,679
discontinuity for uh cable capacity is

1807
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,040
steeper

1808
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,880
and also

1809
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,000
the slope actually includes the advent

1810
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,520
of the edfa

1811
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,359
and that was a that was a real bonus

1812
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,520
that's a that's like a one-time boost

1813
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,600
that you get in cable capacity because

1814
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,120
you're now dealing with multiple

1815
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,759
wavelengths and as as transponders

1816
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,920
evolve those wavelengths are carrying

1817
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,880
more uh more gigabits per second

1818
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,040
so what he also shows are the enabling

1819
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,279
technologies along that curve

1820
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,359
we have forward error correction uh

1821
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,120
technology that boosts capacity we have

1822
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,719
the edfa then the emergence of wdm

1823
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,880
then coherent comes along and then we

1824
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,279
have large area fibers and and high

1825
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,120
positive dispersion fibers and the

1826
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,759
latest technology is sdm

1827
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,198
but there's also a slightly whimsical uh

1828
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:54,000
uh

1829
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,159
progression here of conventional

1830
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,040
uh wisdom uh it it's it's like at the

1831
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,199
beginning the far left it shows

1832
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,120
coherence is the future

1833
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,040
but that wasn't the coherent that we

1834
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,840
know today it was using coherence as a

1835
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,239
low noise amplification technology

1836
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,239
and as soon as edfas came along that

1837
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,040
kind of coherent research started to uh

1838
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,560
drop away so then uh you know

1839
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,120
we we have these these uh uh

1840
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,480
you know

1841
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,159
different technologies coherent becomes

1842
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,960
the future beyond the uh discontinuity

1843
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,120
you know dispersion is now our friend so

1844
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,480
we we have these changing views of of uh

1845
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,360
how you design submarine cables

1846
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,600
so a summary of submarine cable capacity

1847
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,280
evolution historically we have

1848
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
transatlantic cable capacity that that's

1849
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,360
doubled every two years the cost is

1850
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,520
halved every three years and until

1851
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,640
recently

1852
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,360
the focus of development was on

1853
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,560
fiber pair capacity it's now changed

1854
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,719
that the on the highest quality cables

1855
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,560
we're now reaching the limit of what we

1856
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,600
can achieve per fiber pair and so the

1857
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,640
the focus changes to cable capacity

1858
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,600
total cable capacity and that's where um

1859
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,440
sdm comes along

1860
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,600
so

1861
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,600
sdm has this road map

1862
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,480
of

1863
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,400
architectural design that takes us to a

1864
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,880
one petabit per second transatlantic

1865
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,840
cable using proven technologies it's

1866
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,679
only after that that we not need to

1867
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:24,080
start thinking about uh more advanced

1868
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,760
technologies like multi-core fibers and

1869
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,080
so on and there are practical limits on

1870
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,320
the number of fiber pairs that you can

1871
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,120
put into a transatlantic cable so

1872
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,880
multi-core fiber

1873
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,280
is very interesting solves the problem

1874
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,320
of

1875
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,480
of the size of the of the cables and

1876
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,320
hollow core fiber again is very

1877
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,000
interesting but there are you know

1878
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,360
there's a lot of challenges i think

1879
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,400
associated with hollow core so it could

1880
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,480
well be if you looked at terrestrial

1881
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,040
future cable types you may see the

1882
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,679
emergence of hollow core fiber uh

1883
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,920
initially for low latency applications

1884
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,159
but then if you look at subsea cables

1885
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,760
you're more likely to see multi-core

1886
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,480
fibers i think

1887
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,120
appearing in those kinds of cables

1888
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,800
so let me try to summarize all of these

1889
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,239
options i know i covered a lot of ground

1890
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,520
here um and i do apologize because this

1891
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,320
slide does not follow nano guidelines of

1892
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,560
having at least 24-point text

1893
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,760
i i couldn't use 24-point text

1894
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,080
it's really um for you to look at

1895
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,719
afterwards and and use as a kind of

1896
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,280
guide so of course i'm i'm looking

1897
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,719
initially at commercially available

1898
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,960
solutions and then at future

1899
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,800
technologies and the commercially

1900
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,199
available solutions remember i divided

1901
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,280
them down into those three categories

1902
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,280
where you're using the same fiber or

1903
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,679
today's fiber with today's line systems

1904
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,080
moving to existing fiber with new line

1905
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,840
systems and then fiber finally new fiber

1906
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,760
deployments and then in future oh and of

1907
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,000
course the investment rises as you uh

1908
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,760
move from left to right there

1909
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,000
now in the future technologies uh you

1910
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,120
know there's multi-band there's

1911
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,520
multi-core fiber multi-mode fiber and

1912
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,120
hollow-core fiber

1913
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,080
so there what you the question you asked

1914
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,480
there is what is the risk of choosing a

1915
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,239
technology that that isn't going to

1916
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,560
catch on from a from a commercial point

1917
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,239
of view you know the likelihood of

1918
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,840
commercial deployment

1919
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,719
so

1920
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:17,920
on the left hand side there the

1921
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,760
commercially available solutions

1922
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,000
transponder upgrades i didn't cover it

1923
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,840
here because it's quite a complex topic

1924
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,440
and it's very

1925
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,199
dependent on the individual fiber pair

1926
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,040
operator but it's about reducing the

1927
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,120
margins on your network

1928
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,840
some operators still still have a

1929
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,800
lot of

1930
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,040
safety margin in their networks

1931
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,480
and by reducing that you could

1932
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,960
potentially get a lot more capacity

1933
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,320
then you have the options for

1934
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,400
squeezing out more capacity

1935
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,080
on existing fibers by upgrading your

1936
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,320
line systems moving to flexible grid

1937
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,960
roman amplification c plus l and then

1938
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,640
super c super l

1939
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,239
and then the new fiber deployments of

1940
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,880
course we've got ultra low loss uh smf

1941
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,280
28 we've got large area fibers and we've

1942
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,520
got these reduced cladding fibers that

1943
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,000
mean you could have high fiber count uh

1944
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,400
cables so then multiband of course i

1945
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,480
think i think there are lots of

1946
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,560
you know questions with multi-band it's

1947
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,120
a mixed picture um i'm not sure it's

1948
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,800
going to pan out economically with

1949
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,480
multiband

1950
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,080
multimode fiber i covered it very

1951
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,719
briefly the the few mode fiber

1952
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,719
experiments that does mean you have to

1953
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:27,920
develop new transponder techn technology

1954
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,800
um

1955
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,440
multi-core fi multi-hore fiber we have

1956
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,840
the the uncoupled and coupled core i

1957
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,159
think uncoupled uh definitely has a

1958
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,120
future

1959
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,800
because again you don't need to develop

1960
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,640
new transponder technology

1961
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,800
and then hollow core fiber we have these

1962
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
two different uh approaches of photonic

1963
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,760
band gap an anti-resonant um

1964
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,600
photonic band gap seems to be a little

1965
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,760
bit of a dead end at the moment

1966
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,840
that might change who knows somebody has

1967
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,440
a breakthrough and

1968
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,600
and that situation changes but right now

1969
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,920
it's nested structures it's uh

1970
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,480
anti-resonance structures and

1971
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,760
the focus

1972
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,000
has tended to be on low latency

1973
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,520
applications financial trading uh bt has

1974
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,000
a really interesting deployment for uh

1975
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,800
5g front hall so they can increase the

1976
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,960
distance from the radio

1977
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,120
mast uh to the to the cudu by 50

1978
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,280
and that changes the economics of how

1979
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,440
you deploy 5g networks and that's

1980
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,960
because of the lower latency of hollow

1981
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,440
core fiber

1982
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,440
we haven't really explored capacity

1983
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,320
expansion with hollow core fiber and you

1984
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,600
know got little animation there that

1985
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,719
says yet now at some point we will

1986
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,880
but that involves figuring out how to

1987
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,239
amplify on holocal fibers

1988
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,199
so

1989
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,760
i think that's uh probably my last slide

1990
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,159
uh happy to answer questions if i can uh

1991
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:53,210
but but thank you for your attention

1992
01:15:53,210 --> 01:16:00,880
[Applause]

1993
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,640
hi there uh joshua's telstra uh so sub c

1994
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,880
obviously is the area of greatest

1995
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,400
interest to me because you've got all

1996
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,800
these assets in the ocean you really

1997
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,719
don't want to change them

1998
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,640
so i'll admit i'm i'm really focused on

1999
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,840
the far left of your side and

2000
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,640
transponders when you look at high qualm

2001
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,080
technology the issue with reach is

2002
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,000
distinguishing the the different symbols

2003
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,480
once you're at haiquam

2004
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,800
i was wondering we've seen a lot of work

2005
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,760
with ai systems over the last few years

2006
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,840
where they can

2007
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,960
use

2008
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,360
neural nets trained models to reduce

2009
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,920
noise out of image processing

2010
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,840
far in advance of what we used to do

2011
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,560
with

2012
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,360
standard methods has anybody taken

2013
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,520
such computational technologies and

2014
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,760
applied them to resolving

2015
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,360
high noise signals on optical fiber

2016
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,800
um

2017
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,760
so

2018
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,080
using machine learning particularly uh

2019
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,760
there are actually there are two ways to

2020
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,400
use the use this in subsea networks one

2021
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,640
is by analyzing the performance over the

2022
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,719
life of the um

2023
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:07,920
of the cable

2024
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,760
so that you can predict

2025
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,120
if you're getting close to your margin

2026
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,440
limits um

2027
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,199
as you know you tend to design cables

2028
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,920
with a certain end of life margin and if

2029
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,760
you could reduce that because you know

2030
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,679
you're going to change transponders in

2031
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,080
three years or four years then you know

2032
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,159
that might be interesting to understand

2033
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:28,320
how those margins change

2034
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,480
by feeding a kind of big data model and

2035
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,480
throwing machine learning at it that's a

2036
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,400
that's a non-real-time approach

2037
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,080
obviously i think what you're describing

2038
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,840
is a real-time approach

2039
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,640
uh and where that's being used

2040
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,480
or the way i know at the moment that

2041
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,400
it's being used is in non-linear

2042
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,880
compensation techniques so the

2043
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,960
there are methods of machine learning

2044
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,040
for non-linear compensation so

2045
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,800
and that that would be a noise reduction

2046
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,080
you know that's a form of noise

2047
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,120
reduction but in terms of like ase noise

2048
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,600
reduction and and those aspects i'm not

2049
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,360
aware of that at the moment and it would

2050
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,040
have to presumably happen in the

2051
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,800
amplifiers because that's the main

2052
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,719
source of noise that you get on the

2053
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,719
cable which you know wouldn't wouldn't

2054
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:11,920
work with existing cables

2055
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,800
uh hello my name is corbin um and i have

2056
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,400
a bit of a whimsical question for the

2057
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,320
last day of the conference um this is

2058
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,840
the first i've learned of hollow core

2059
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,920
fiber but do we now have to acknowledge

2060
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,840
the vision of american senator ted

2061
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,280
stevens when he said that the internet

2062
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,460
is just a series of tubes

2063
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:31,730
[Laughter]

2064
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:34,640
[Applause]

2065
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,480
well i guess we better ask al gore

2066
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,919
didn't he invent the internet yes

2067
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,719
um patrick gilmore meta on one of your

2068
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,800
slides you said um these three things

2069
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,560
would require their own tutorials would

2070
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,840
you please come back and give all three

2071
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,080
of those oh i'd be glad to yeah

2072
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,840
absolutely thank you yeah

2073
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,440
i'm gonna give one more plug

2074
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,960
if anybody enjoyed the martian by andy

2075
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:03,920
weir

2076
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,840
he did a follow-up book called artemis

2077
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,840
where

2078
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,640
zbland style fiber is a core plot point

2079
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,520
oh

2080
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,040
if you enjoy that type of thing pick it

2081
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,400
up it's good reading for the plane

2082
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,839
artemis yeah i will do yeah thank you

2083
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,360
thank you very much thank you james

2084
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,280
thank you jeff we appreciate that talk i

2085
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,960
think uh

2086
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,560
speaking for myself alone but probably

2087
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,560
several other people we all are going

2088
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,120
away knowing far more about optical

2089
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,719
systems than we did coming into the room

2090
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,860
so appreciate it

2091
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:44,188
