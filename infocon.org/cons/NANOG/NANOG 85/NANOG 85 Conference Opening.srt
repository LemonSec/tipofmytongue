112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,720
those stats i know it's very limited

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,320
right now but we're hoping to enhance

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
this

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,320

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,759
and we want to see

121
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,880
the different networks and how they

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
perform against each other and see if we

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
can you know get some differences in v6

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,120

125
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
we also have our attendance stats here

126
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,600

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240

131
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
which is great we i've seen i've met

132
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
with people on the virtual tables all

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,639
the way from africa to you know local

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,240
that couldn't get time off of work

135
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
whatever um so we love that people can

136
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,919
attend even if they can't be here in the

137
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,159
room

138
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,479
all right so

139
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,960
when i think of nanog the most important

140
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
thing for me is community

141
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
while the presentations are fantastic

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
and that brings everybody to these

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,759
events

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,039
what i like coming is is the friendships

145
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,919
the the peers if i have a problem i know

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,520
who i can call at that company and

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
they're going to help me it's going to

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
be a real person that's going to help me

149
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
solve an issue

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,080
that's what i get from nanak

151
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,000
i've been coming to nanog for over 10

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,120
years now

153
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,960
and i find

154
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,520
the first time i came i knew nobody in

155
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,359
the hallways it was quite intimidating

156
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
and you know once you start to form that

157
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
sense of community this is the best

158
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
place to be and you really look forward

159
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,319
to the to the visits and seeing

160
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,280
everybody

161
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
we recognize as our community grows and

162
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
not everybody has that feeling when they

163
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,479
come and it develops over over years

164
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,080
and we're trying to think of ways we can

165
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,319
get people together um

166
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,639
other than the socials that are so big

167
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,479
in smaller groups and get to know each

168
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,759
other and find people with common

169
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,720
interests

170
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
and that's why we came up with this idea

171
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
of the community forum it's it's got a

172
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
um on discourse there's all these chats

173
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
and the idea of introducing smaller

174
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
events coffee walks

175
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,840
whiskey connoisseurs

176
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,759
running you know find people that have

177
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,240
interests like you peer team up and go

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,039
in small groups so you can also get to

179
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,120
know more people in this community and

180
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
if you're new to the community meet

181
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,639
those long-term friends that you'll know

182
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,039
forever

183
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
at the next meeting

184
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,400

pages do a post join an event that's

195

together and find more community

197

199
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
i'm not going to get up here and read

200
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,639
all the code of conduct to you today i

201
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,880
will tell you that for us to be

202
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,319
successful and have that sense of

203
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,800
community we have to be inclusive

204
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,280
we have to be good to each other we have

205
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,039
to police our neighbors if you see

206
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,199
somebody acting poorly or somebody being

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,000
mistreated you need to say something

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,560
we don't want this community to have any

209
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
issues with code of conduct

210
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
and this is here to support us all if

211
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,879
you haven't read it please read through

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,160
it it's not that long and it's very

213
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,520
important and it's important that we

214
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
call people out that are doing this some

215
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,599
people have been coming for years and

216
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,840
years and they don't understand

217
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,360
if something they're doing might be

218
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,080
offensive and we don't want that and

219
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,599
likewise we want people to feel

220
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,039
comfortable coming to those microphones

221
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,039
and they're not going to be intimidated

222
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,680
scared run off or anything i mean

223
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,120
honestly i didn't go to a microphone

224
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
for more years than i i'd like to admit

225
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
because i was scared of some of the

226
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,759
the aggressiveness in the room so if you

227
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,479
find anybody being like that

228
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
please say something to them kindly

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
nicely we all need to grow we all need

230
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
to embrace this and make this a very

231
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
inclusive environment it's very

232
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,279
important for community to work

233
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,000

234

[Applause]

298
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,160
so we didn't coordinate this but uh tina

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,519
stole some of my lines

300
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,920
but welcome it's great to see so many uh

301

friendly faces in the crowd people that

302
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
i know and people that i'm

303
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,800
hoping to soon know

304
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
uh team camry

305
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
and the way

306
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,519
you pronounce that is comrade the easy

307
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,120
way to remember that is to take the y

308
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,519
and the u and flip them around

309
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,800
and then that's how you that's how you

310
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,040
can remember how to pronounce the name

311
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,320
why the name

312
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,200
well komri is the welsh word for wales

313
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,959
and our founders

314
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
looked into some of their uh heredity

315
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,320
ties and discovered that they were welsh

316
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,000
that's that's the official story now the

317
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
other story the the one that i think is

318
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
actually more true is that they saw the

319
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,839
welsh flag with the dragon on it and

320
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,600
they're big they're big d and d people

321
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
right so

322
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
they saw the flag and they're like

323
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,680
that's great we love that and it's cool

324
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,519
it's cool that we now have this as our

325
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,440
flag because we can make like some

326
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,560
pretty interesting uses of that logo

327
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,800
like a dragon

328
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,440
shooting fire onto a pirate ship

329
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,760
in in the middle of the ocean on an old

330
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
on an old uh

331
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,880
world map right

332
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
um

333
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,959
but anyway i i was having a conversation

334
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,160
with a friend yesterday about how

335
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,000
engineers like to go deeper and deeper

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,399
into answering the question why

337
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,480
so i'm going to leave it at that i have

338
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,399
no idea why there's a dragon on the

339
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,480
welsh flag but i got you to the flag so

340
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
if you're into vexillology

341
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
i'm looking for you to answer that

342
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,680
question for me

343
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,639
um

344
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,160
the other thing about our fenders though

345
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
is that they were also network operators

346
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
they have a background that shared

347
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
amongst many people in this room

348
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,880
and

349
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,040
several of our projects are aimed

350
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
directly at network operators in fact

351
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,560
pretty much all of them are

352
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,399
and some of you may know some of our

353
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
older projects and might know us as the

354
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
bogon people and we've

355
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
we still run the bogon project we still

356
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,519
allow you to appear with us to receive

357
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,839
the bogon feeds live

358
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,639
but

359
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,240
we've done a lot more since then and

360
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
there's a lot of other things that we've

361
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
that we offer as community services now

362
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,800
we've kind of been ingrained though with

363
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
the community and

364
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
you know tina was talking about

365
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,680
community

366
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,079
our community focus is making our

367
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,120
partners heroes and we mean that like

368
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
our company mission is to save and

369
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
improve human lives

370
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
but we

371
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,920
we are nerds first that look at secure

372
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,480
the security of the internet as uh the

373
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
what we attempt to

374
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,279
uh research study and improve

375
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,120
we need partnerships with people like

376
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,240
you

377
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,920
to help us to accomplish the goal of

378
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,240
saving and improving human lives

379
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,920
and the way that we do that is through

380
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,639
community cooperation

381
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,079
none of us

382
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,320
the internet itself doesn't really work

383
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,920
without cooperation you have peering

384
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,839
coordinators in the room and peering of

385
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,360
network operators

386
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,959
with the singular goal of to pass

387
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,040
packets forward right

388
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
that requires broad cooperation amongst

389
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,440
operators in this room and worldwide

390
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,040
what we do with that community

391
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120
cooperation is we turn that

392
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
we we take that same form of cooperation

393
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,800
and we apply that to a different set of

394
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,360
problems we say how can we coordinate

395
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,440
together work together as community

396
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
opera a community of operator

397
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,639
operators to help to secure the internet

398
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,760
and

399
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,839
my my role at team comrie i'm chief

400
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,600
architect of the community services so

401
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,639
this is something that i'm quite

402
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,160
passionate about

403
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
what we need and what we do is we offer

404
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,399
services to the community of operators

405
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,720
in this room and around the world

406
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,199
to help to secure the internet to make

407
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,040
it a safer environment for all people

408
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
worldwide because

409
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,000
one of the things that fascinates me

410
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
about the internet perhaps more than

411
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,680
anything else is that access to the

412
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,519
internet has created

413
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,000
the ability for people to connect across

414
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,560
borders to form communities and when you

415
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
start to think about the power of that

416
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,480
when especially applied to marginalized

417
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,880
populations and people that their their

418
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,440
home countries are not friendly to

419
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,279
whatever their particular proclivity is

420
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,000
or their their passions or who they are

421
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,680
as a person

422
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
the internet helps

423
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,480
them to have a place to come a place to

424
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,560
to find community and to connect with

425
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
others

426
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,199
there's power in this room and there's

427
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,199
power in all of us to help to work

428
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,199
together to cooperate on

429
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,120
problems big and small

430
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,279
to solve

431
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,199
to solve the issues that that are out

432
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
there and to help to bring about a

433
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,199
better world and that's really what

434
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,560
we're what

435
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,959
our mission is about that's who we are

436
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,399
we're passionate about it and we'd love

437
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,920
to work with you to help them bring that

438

out bring that

439
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,360

for just regular conversations um use

473
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
the q a tab to ask a question that you

474
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,760
want asked during the presentation

475
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,439
we'll be moderating both the people

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,199
coming up to the microphones and those

477
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,119
virtual questions in q a and switching

478

510
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,400
make sure your profile has a cell number

511
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
so we can notice you but

512
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,559
sorry so we can notify you by text if

513
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,840

wednesday you must be on site to present

519
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
there was confusion around this last

520
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
time so i'm just emphasizing that

521
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,760
please stay around for wednesday evening

522
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,280
if you're doing a lighting talk

523
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,880
a few reminders our call for

524
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,280
presentations are always open and not

525
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,120
just for the next nano but for falling

526
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,280
ones as well so you can submit for i

527
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,760
believe three or four i think nanak 89

528
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,280
right now is the latest you can submit

529
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,400
for

530
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
so get your stuff in early we can accept

531
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
things early we don't always just except

532
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,760
for the next snanag if you have an

533
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
amazing talk and the pc reviews it

534
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
because it's ready for review now but

535
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,039
you want to present two now from now we

536
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,559
can accept you for two nanos from now if

537
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,640
it's that good so get your talk to now

538
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,480
we'll help you improve them if needed

539
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
and work with you on everything

540
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,000
also the feedback on the surveys is more

541
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,679
important than ever we're still trying

542
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,120
to get it right with the post management

543
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
world with our improvements with virtual

544
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
with everything so please

545
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
let us know how the hybrid experience is

546
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,960
going for all of you

547
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,080
we've made some improvements to the

548
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
surveys to make them even easier i hope

549
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,480
so now it's just thumbs up thumbs down

550
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
or i didn't attend

551
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,000
so super easy no more reading on a scale

552
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,160
and you can find all those at nano.org

553
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,640
surveys and surveys will close on friday

554
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,200
june 10th

555
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,520
i just want to say a few quick word of

556
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
words about some members that we lost

557
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,840
between the last nog and this one

558
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,160
so we had dorian kim who passed away

559
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,000
recently and dorian was instrumental to

560
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
nanak behind the scenes

561
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,320
he really helped the board and new nog

562
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,159
during the early years and then his

563
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
sponsorship was was very helpful in

564
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,080
keeping nanak live in those earlier

565
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,120
years

566
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,320
um

567
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,679
and we probably wouldn't have succeeded

568
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,440
in the early times without dorian

569
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
so we all miss him and then susan uh

570
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,960
harris was the final program committee

571
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
chair from merit

572
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,840
during the days of their leadership and

573
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,360
she was a fierce advocate for the values

574
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
of the nanak community and she also

575
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,520
passed away this year

576
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,760
going forward we now on that

577
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,480
community.org page that tina was

578
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,200
mentioning where you can find the

579
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
affinity groups we've also added a

580
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,760
section on there from in memoriam so um

581
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
i actually received lots of emails um

582
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,679
about dory and susan of people that want

583
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,880
to share stories about them and

584
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
unfortunately we have very limited time

585
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,159
in the conference so i could not read

586
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,679
all those here but they've all been

587
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,520
posted into this discourse page for

588
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,880
people to read and we would love you all

589
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
to go on there and share your own

590
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,840
memories of these people if you knew

591
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,600
them so that we can all keep them alive

592
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
in our memories

593
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,120
if you see a name that needs to be added

594
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
we have a really easy form on nano.org

595
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,120
resources

596
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
and you can go and fill in the name of

597
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,919
the person you'd like to have added we

598
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,120
only have a few people on there right

599
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,039
now the two that you saw there as well

600
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,799
as a few others but i know we're missing

601
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,880
a lot of people so please do let us know

602
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,159
if there's more names you want to add to

603
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,240
that page and with the pc um we'll get

604
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,280
those added for you so

605
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
