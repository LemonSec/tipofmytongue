greeting by now

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,479

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,520

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,479
english for english

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
so if you can muster some frenglish you

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,960
will feel right at home here in montreal

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,759
so as fergus said i was born raised and

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,679
educated in montreal

52
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,480
and it's been my gateway

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
to the world

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,879
my starting point in the international

55
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,280
telecommunication journey and nanog

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,160
i started my career in 1993 as a young

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,200
grad at teleglobe canada

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200
in 1996 i launched as6453

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,519
which you probably recognize

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,599
in 2013

61
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,239
i co-founded kicks the montreal internet

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,519
exchange a proud sponsor today

63
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,440
uh so nanag and me

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,319
uh

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,080
i got involved with nanog the first time

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,760
was 2003. i attended nanak 30 in miami

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,519
and then um

68
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,400
i have to admit you're an intimated

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,560
intimate

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,000
intimidating bunch

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,560
it took me nine nanaks to

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,959
muster the courage to put a presentation

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
together and i presented at nana 39 in

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,519
toronto

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,080
on the taiwan earthquake

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
cable cuts

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
and then i got involved

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
i felt

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,319
i felt some comfort here

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,560
in exchanging ideas

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
as a healthy place for a debate and i

82
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
decided that i should

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,799
try to lead the change from the inside

84
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
so i wanted more representation in nanog

85
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
so i had to

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
advocate what i preached and i got

87
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
involved so i joined the program

88
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,599
committee and then the board of

89
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,040
directors

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
and i've attended i don't know i think

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,959
probably around 14 nanooks but i'm sure

92
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,360
one of you in this room will be able to

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,159
keep me straight

94
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
so building networks during a pandemic

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,720
what could possibly have changed

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,799
everything

97
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,959
so before the pandemic

98
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,000
the

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,879
my

100
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,599
way of doing things or i guess my team's

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,320
way of doing things

102
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
we were going on site we were developing

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
relationships so there was a lot of

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,600
traveling involved

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
definitely probably more than my body

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
could sustain

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
but it was part of the job

108
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,160
now during the pandemic

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
my world completely changed i was at

110
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
home 24 7

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,120
and i think for more than 800 days

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,360
and i felt some loneliness i also felt

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
some powerlessness i felt that

114
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,440
everything was a struggle difficult

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
talking to people

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
had to be booked

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,960
programmed a water cooler conversation

118
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,320
had to be an event in my calendar

119
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,639
so that i could connect

120
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,560
so i i felt unconnected and my job is to

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,440
connect the world but i personally felt

122
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
unconnected

123
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
however my sense of purpose

124
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
was intact

125
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,360
and that that kept me going

126
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,680
so i'm here to um talk to you about

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
google's network infrastructure

128
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
investments

129
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,919
in the on the african continent more

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,800
specifically the equiano cable

131
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
announced in june

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,240
2019

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
equiano is the next generation subsea

134
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,039
internet cable that will ultimately run

135
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,840
from portugal to south africa

136
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
along the atlantic coast of africa

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
the initial configuration of the cable

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
system include

139
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
landings in lomme togo

140
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,919
lagos nigeria the largest african

141
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,960
economy cape town in south africa

142
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,840
the continent's most advanced economy

143
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
and swakopmund namibia

144
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
the cable has already made several

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
landings i'll shed some light on that

146
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,720
later and it's expected to go live by

147
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
the end of this year

148
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
in this presentation

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
i want to highlight why africa is so

150
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,440
central to google's plans to get to the

151
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,080
next billion users online

152
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,639
as many of you probably know

153
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,199
the continent is the most underserved in

154
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,680
terms of internet infrastructure

155
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
with penetration and uptake of online

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,120
technology and services lagging behind

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
other regions

158
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,520
for many people around the world

159
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,880
africa evokes images of poverty

160
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
famine or conflict

161
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,560
in other words

162
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
major challenges

163
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,319
while it's true that the continent

164
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
continues to face challenges this

165
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,840
perspective masked much of the reality

166
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,479
on the ground

167
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,560
in the tekken connectivity spheres in

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,199
particular we've seen exponential growth

169
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,720
in investments

170
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
from local and international players

171
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
like google in recent years

172
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
these investments are having a

173
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
transformative impact

174
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,919
on the continent accelerating

175
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,479
sustainable economic growth

176
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,800
creating much needed jobs

177
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,039
and creating the right conditions for

178
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,520
the continent to flourish

179
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,080
africa is no longer a continent we can

180
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,599
ignore

181
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,880
its population is set to almost double

182
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
by 2050

183
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,479
that's only

184
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,840
30 years

185
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,599
when a quarter of the world's people

186
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,520
will be african

187
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,759
its economy is expanding quicker than

188
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,360
anywhere else

189
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
its innovation and venture capital

190
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
system is growing at a record rate

191
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,199
underpinned by young and growing pool of

192
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
professional developers

193
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,080
after setting the scene and explaining

194
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
why africa is already so important

195
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,599
and will become even more important in

196
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,240
the coming years i'll shed some night on

197
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,120
equiano what it does who it serves and

198
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
what milestones

199
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,759
we've already reached

200
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,039
so

201
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,400
why

202
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,280
sorry i should have moved to this slide

203
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,440
why africa

204
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
firstly it's important to remember that

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
africa is not a country it's a continent

206
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,440
of 54 countries

207
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,839
each with their own culture history

208
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,360
economy

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
states of development

210
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
and levels of stability

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
and each of them offer different

212
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
opportunities

213
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
the continent is often painted with a

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
broad brush

215
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
but there are immense variations between

216
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,600
africa's countries

217
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
there's a huge difference between

218
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,399
nigeria the largest economy with a

219
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,920
population of 200 million people

220
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,480
centered around the economic capital and

221
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,640
powerhouse that is lagos

222
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
and the continent's six island states

223
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,240
that have combined population of less

224
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,839
than 30 million people

225
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,360
likewise there's a huge difference

226
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
between togo

227
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,920
and nigeria two countries where equiano

228
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
is landing

229
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
that are separated only by 50 kilometers

230
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,160
but with a different language and

231
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,560
different economy

232
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,839
from an internet connectivity

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
perspective sub-saharan africa remains

234
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,839
the most underserved region in terms of

235
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,760
internet infrastructure

236
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,200
penetration stands at 32 percent

237
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
while for the entire continent including

238
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
north africa it's at 40 percent

239
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,160
by contrast internet penetration by

240
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
population in the us and in north

241
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,480
america is around 90 percent

242
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,959
across the continent a significant share

243
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,279
of the population lives without internet

244
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,880
access that is fast reliable

245
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
cheap and of good quality

246
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,120
in other words

247
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,320
something we all here at nanog take for

248
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,760
granted

249
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,920
and have taken for granted

250
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
well over a decade or actually i should

251
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,839
say we have worked hard well over a

252
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,079
decade from this there's a clear need to

253
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,560
invest in network infrastructure

254
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
to boost connectivity across the

255
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
continent and get more people online

256
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
more importantly the continent

257
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,279
need for improved connectivity is also

258
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,519
based on future gap

259
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,959
let me show you these

260
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,800
africa is home to 1.3 billion people

261
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
or currently 16

262
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,600
of the global population

263
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,120
of the 20 fastest growest growing

264
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,839
country in the world

265
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,600
19 are in africa

266
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,959
projections indicate that 87 population

267
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,880
growth in africa between 2020 and 2050

268
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,480
will result in a total population of 2.5

269
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
billion

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,640
the african continent is demographically

271
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,760
young

272
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,200
60 percent of the population will be

273
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,320
under 24 years of age by 2025

274
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
and africa will be home to one in three

275
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
youth

276
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,440
globally

277
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
by 2050.

278
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
in parallel

279
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,920
africa is experiencing rapid

280
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
urbanization

281
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,880
with 68 cities each home to over 1

282
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,399
million people

283
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,000
in 2020

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,639
the number of such cities is projected

285
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,399
to increase by

286
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,000
285

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,160
by 2025

288
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,600
in three years

289
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,120
some countries nigeria ghana and angola

290
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,320
among them

291
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,240
will see the proportion of urban

292
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
residents increased to over 80 percent

293
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
of their total population by 2050.

294
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,440
when 800 million more africans will have

295
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,000
moved to urban areas

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,320
in addition there's been a general

297
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
improvement in life expectancy as

298
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
sub-saharan africans are expected to

299
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,160
need to live nearly six years longer

300
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,480
than a decade ago

301
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
what does this all mean

302
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,760
simply put these positive trends suggest

303
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,360
a higher adoption of digital services in

304
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
africa and the future in other words

305
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,959
many of the next billion users to come

306
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,040
online in the coming years

307
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,160
will be from africa

308
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
what do these demographic trends mean

309
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
for africa's economy

310
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,560
the answer is that africa's demographic

311
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,880
boom fuels consumption

312
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,360
young africans consumers are becoming

313
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,399
more affluent and globalized as they

314
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,800
also grow to become household decision

315
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,399
makers

316
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,839
this boosts the continent's

317
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,720
competitiveness in both skilled and

318
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,120
unskilled labor and will lead to

319
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
increased spending

320
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
increased spending power

321
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,160
for consumers by 2030

322
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,120
africa is expected to be home to over

323
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
1.7

324
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,839
billion consumers with total consumer

325
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,839
expenditures of 2.5 trillion

326
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,320
these trends are already at work

327
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,279
africa's economy has expanded

328
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,360
significantly over the last decade and

329
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,480
an average faster and on average faster

330
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,920
than most other regions

331
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,279
after years of negotiation

332
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,320
the african continental free trade area

333
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,560
fcfcfta came into effect in january

334
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,079
2021.

335
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,120
it's the world's largest free trade area

336
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
by number of members

337
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,800
covering 1.3 billion

338
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,160
individuals across 54 countries with a

339
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,480
combined gdp of

340
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,079
3.4 trillion dollars

341
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
as i said earlier

342
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,360
we can no longer ignore the african

343
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,320
continent at google we are bullish about

344
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,720
the africa africa's future and that's

345
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
why we're investing today to bring more

346
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,680
people online and broaden access to

347
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,839
digital services

348
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,680
google is by no means the only

349
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,160
international tech company or backbone

350
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
operator doing this

351
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
over the

352
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,199
last few years

353
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,519
we've seen groundswell interest of an

354
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,920
investment by african and international

355
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,959
investors a few merit attention

356
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,440
facebook meta is spearheading a

357
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,600
consortium of network operators and

358
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
telcos to build a submarine cable called

359
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,839
to africa

360
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
that will encircle the african continent

361
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,360
and should go live in 2024.

362
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,560
last year

363
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,120
equinix announced it was acquiring main

364
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,000
one

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,880
a pioneering nigerian company that

366
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,079
operates

367
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,560
a submarine cable along the west coast

368
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,759
of africa

369
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,160

371
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,839
in january of this year

372
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,000
digital realty announced the acquisition

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,519
of terraco

374
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,560
africa's largest colocation provider

375
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
by 2025

376
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,800
the internet economy has the potential

377
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,120
to contribute

378
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,240
180 billion to africa's economy growing

379
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,959
to

380
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:00,800
712 billion by 2020 2050.

strong developer talent public and

387
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
private investment

388
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
investments in digital infrastructure

389
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
and new government policies and

390
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,440
regulations will continue to drive this

391
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,480
growth for africa

392
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,839
submarine cables are an integral

393
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,920
are integral to bridging connectivity

394
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,800
gaps

395
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
and accelerating digital transformation

396
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,880
they are

397
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,959
the world's information super highways

398
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,519
and form the cornerstone of the internet

399
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,040
they carry an estimated 80 97 percent of

400
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
global international communications

401
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,880
and 10 trillion in daily financial

403
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,320
international traffic is satellite based

404
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,120
high speed high capacity connections

405
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,679
underpinned by submarine infrastructure

406
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,799
are central to today's hyper-connected

407
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,959
global economy

408
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,599

streaming and conferencing international

410
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,319
phone calls and support the growth of

411
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,559
cloud computing

412
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
significant investments in partnerships

413
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,679
along the entire value chain can boost

414
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,039
connectivity

415
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,760
increase internet penetration reduce

416
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,200
prices and improve quality of service to

417
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,360
end users

418
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,679
submarine cables while not the only

419
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,880
factor are central to unlocking africa's

420
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
digital potential and narrowing the

421
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
digital divide between the continent and

422
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,679
more connected regions

423
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,840
the vast majority of online content

424
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,880
consumed in africa is hosted in data

425
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,679
centers outside the continent

426
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,240
with submarine cables transporting data

427
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,799
between users and data centers through a

428
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,400
vast complex value chain

429
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
africa faces fine

430
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
main challenges

431
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,200
at this on all stages of the value chain

432
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,919
data centers are predominantly located

433
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,720
outside africa meaning content for users

434
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,679
on the continent has to travel far via

435
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,760
international submarine cables or

436
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,840
expensive satellite links

437
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
existing and as a matter of fact you can

438
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,720
fit

439
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,760
three times the continental us

440
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,160
into the continent of africa if you look

441
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,280
it up on a map just to give you a sheer

442
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
idea of size

443
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,799
existing submarine cables are aging and

444
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,679
typically rely on older technology while

445
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,240
many countries lack redundancy

446
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,480
existing subsidy infrastructure will be

447
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,200
unable to meet the rising demand

448
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
for international bandwidth

449
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
in the coming years

450
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,480
edge locations on the continent are not

451
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,400
yet fully developed

452
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
meaning content has to travel further to

453
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,000
end users

454
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,600
increasing cost and access and latency

455
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,320
new and ex new and existing internet

456
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,720
exchange points need to grow

457
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,679
to ensure content is hosted locally and

458
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,039
traffic is routed efficiently

459
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,320
middle mile infrastructure is

460
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,720
underdeveloped despite strong growth in

461
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
recent years

462
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,320
internet access networks are not

463
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
sufficiently dense or developed to

464
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
provide universal access

465
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,720
currently 25 of africa's population does

466
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,240
not live

467
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,320
within the footprint of a mobile

468
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,400
broadband network

469
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
boosting submarine connectivity will not

470
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,799
solve all these problems

471
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,600
however submarine infrastructure is

472
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,840
central to connectivity in africa and

473
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,080
around the world

474
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,120
the first map here is showing you

475
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
africa's terrestrial and submarine

476
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,080
fibers you can see that

477
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,440
many areas are under development

478
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,120
and the second map

479
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,520
shows the african countries by number of

480
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
cable landings

481
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,559
the darkest one is 12 cables and that's

482
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,880
egypt where most

483
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,919
cables

484
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,559
go through the sways canal

485
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,559
and you see the

486
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,120
whitish area on the map are the

487
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,760
landlocked unconnected country by

488
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
submarine cables obviously

489
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,200
and the gray ones are those with only

490
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,919
one cable

491
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,440
so what's a quiano

492
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,080
is a next-generation subsea

493
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,799
uh internet cable spearheaded by google

494
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
that will run from portugal to south

495
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
africa along the atlantic coast of

496
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,799
africa

497
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,480
its planned landings are lommei in togo

498
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,159
lagos nigeria

499
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,320
swakopmund namibia

500
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,400
cape town south africa

501
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,559
and rupert's bay in saint elena with

502
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,960
branching units in place for a second

503
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,840
phase of the

504
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,480
project

505
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
last year

506
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,240
the cable landed in rupert's bay saint

507
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,840
helena

508
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,360
earlier this year

509
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,240
the cable landed in lomme

510
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,159
in lisbon

511
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,480
and lagos

512
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,440
from a technical perspective

513
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,159
equiano cable is the first sub c cable

514
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,480
to incorporate optical switching at the

515
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,880
pair level at the fiber pair level

516
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,039
rather than the traditional approach of

517
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,480
wavelength level switching equiano will

518
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,039
also be the first spatial division

519
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,120
multiplex cable deployed along this

520
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,280
route allowing for a greater design

521
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,400
capacity of 144 terabit per second

522
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
so why did google decide to invest in

523
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,559
equiano

524
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,080
our decision was based on five factors

525
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,880
africa is home to over 20 submarine

526
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,520
cables some of which began operations

527
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,840
almost 20 years ago

528
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
and are nearing the end of their life

529
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
cycles

530
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
equiano is a state-of-the-art cable that

531
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
leverages next generation technology to

532
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,840
provide significantly more capacity than

533
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,559
the last set of cables built to serve

534
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,280
the continent

535
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,360
africa's growing

536
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,760
rapidly growing population and internet

537
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
user base combined with more intensive

538
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,440
use of the internet means that the

539
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
current submarine cables

540
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,919
will be unable to meet demand beyond the

541
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,520
next few years

542
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,000
investing today means

543
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,159
we are well prepared to serve tomorrow's

544
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,679
users

545
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
better performance

546
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,159
latency forms the cornerstone of good

547
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,840
user experience

548
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
that's our mission in this room

549
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,919
the increased

550
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,840
the increased bandwidth will bring to

551
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
africa

552
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,919
more latency sensitive products to

553
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,880
function

554
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,039
and to be developed

555
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,440
and last and fourth one is redundancy

556
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
africa currently has relatively few

557
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,840
submarine cables connecting to other

558
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,760
geographies as you've seen on the map

559
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,159
sometimes only one the majority of

560
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,440
countries

561
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
that are served by

562
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
only one or two cable is astounding as

563
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,720
outlined in the cables in the case study

564
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,720
when cables are damaged when they break

565
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,960
or when they undergo repairs

566
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,200
it means that users will

567
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,360
definitely suffer

568
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,679
through the disruptions building new

569
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,840
cables will improve consistency and

570
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,520
resiliency creating diverse and scalable

571
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,559
paths to raise me reach more users

572
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,640
as part of the construction design

573
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,559
several branching units are placed

574
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,960
already for on the sea floor

575
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,760
for

576
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
for a second phase by having more

577
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
control over the design

578
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,679
construction and upgrade

579
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,520
google will be able to quickly deploy

580
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,440
additional branches to bring more

581
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,279
contents to closer to users

582
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,960
this is a project built on partnerships

583
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,240
while we're spearheading the

584
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,960
construction of the aquiano cable other

585
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
partners namely wholesale network

586
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
providers

587
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,720
are able to use and benefit benefit from

588
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
the cable's additional capacity

589
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,720
we do not directly provide broadband or

590
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,600
mobile access to end users but instead

591
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
partners with multiple key

592
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,799
telecom players such as telcos or

593
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,880
infrastructure operators

594
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,200
where equiano lands to ensure that the

595
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,279
cable's capacity

596
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,760
benefits the most users and the most

597
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,039
businesses

598
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,158
across the continent

599
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
now we wanted to measure the impact of

600
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,679
this investment so we commissioned the

601
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,880
africa practice and genesis analytics to

602
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
produce a series of economic impact

603
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
assessments for the countries where

604
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
equiano will land

605
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,919
the impact metrics are based on robust

606
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,360
economic and econometric studies using

607
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
historical data where possible

608
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
i'm going to use here togo as a case

609
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,000
study

610
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,200
to highlight acquiano's economic impact

611
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
because togo has put in place some

612
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
excellent policies to attract

613
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,919
investments in the digital sphere and to

614
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,799
accelerate digital growth and digital

615
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,240
transformation

616
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,880
it's one of the continents leaders in

617
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,679
this regard

618
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,360
the increase in international bandwidth

619
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,840
capacity following the landing is

620
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,320
expected to have an immediate impact on

621
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,880
average ip transit prices

622
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,039
on speeds and on latency

623
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,440
for end users in togo this will

624
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,919
translate to cheaper and more reliable

625
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,440
internet access

626
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
leading to a substantial growth in user

627
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,159
in traffic and internet concentration

628
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,640
the cost of long-haul transmission of

629
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,840
data is a major determinant of local ip

630
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,360
transit prices

631
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,919
equiano's landing in togo will create a

632
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,480
new high-speed route for international

633
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
data transmission

634
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
the cable's lower installation costs

635
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,919
relative to its design capacity as well

636
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,400
as increased competition for the

637
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
long-haul transmission of data

638
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,919
will lead to lower ip transit prices in

639
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,880
turn

640
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,360
lower ip transit prices could be passed

641
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,200
on to consumers

642
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
true decreases in their internet prices

643
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,880
or indirectly through the provision of

644
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
more data

645
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,200
uncapped data limits or higher speeds at

646
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
the same price

647
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,840
the increased international bandwidth

648
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,600
capacity means that more data can be

649
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,080
transmitted to togo within a particular

650
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,279
time frame

651
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,760
this will translate into faster internet

652
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,960
speeds and lower latency particularly

653
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,600
with regard to non-cachable content and

654
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,039
the area

655
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,559
of close in the areas in close proximity

656
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,120
to terrestrial fiber optic cables

657
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,760
lower prices combined with improved

658
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,960
speeds and latency are expected to

659
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,679
increase internet penetration in togo by

660
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,919
5.1

661
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,080
percentage points between 2021 and 2025.

662
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,320
faster internet speeds will lead to a

663
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,960
higher demand in data traffic

664
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,960
in parallel lower internet retail prices

665
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,399
will increase internet usage both

666
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,039
extensively

667
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,840
by enabling new users to get online for

668
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
the first time

669
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,039
as well as new ways of using the

670
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,760
internet for the existing users

671
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,120
and intensively by enabling existing

672
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,479
users to consume more data

673
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,679
submarine cable's impact on speeds and

674
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,720
prices can catalyze investments

675
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
by isps and infrastructure providers

676
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,000
thereby expanding the terra terrestrial

677
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,440
networks

678
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
specifically lower ip transit prices

679
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,320
following the landing of such cables as

680
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,399
equiano or to africa

681
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,360
will improve it isp's bottom lines

682
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,600
enabling them to invest in the expansion

683
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,039
of their networks

684
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,039
to reach new customers

685
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,640
in the middle mile

686
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,159
in parallel

687
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,559
greater demand and usage of the internet

688
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,480
following equiano's landing is also

689
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,760
expected to increase isp's revenue in

690
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,840
inducing the expansion of their networks

691
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,760
internet capacity

692
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,799
unlocks significant economic

693
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,360
opportunities more so in developing

694
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,919
countries than other developed parts a

695
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,840
landmark study by the international

696
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,360
telecom union

697
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,240
in 2019 found that in africa

698
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,679
a 10

699
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,039
increase

700
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,600
in mobile internet penetration increases

701
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,720
gdp

702
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,080
per capita by 2.5

703
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
improved connectivity and higher

704
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,720
internet penetration unlocks significant

705
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,120
opportunities for individuals for

706
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,080
businesses and for governments

707
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,640
in togo the digital economy can be a

708
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,880
real game changer for the country's

709
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
economy and society

710
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,320
it represents an

711
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,559
opportunity to accelerate growth to

712
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,000
industrialize

713
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,360
to innovate

714
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,799
and to improve

715
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,240
people's lives

716
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,520
crucially

717
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,919
it offers a pathway to diversity to

718
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,159
diversify the economy away from

719
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,880
agriculture which has historically been

720
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,200
the dominant factor

721
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,279
on the employment front

722
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,679
equiano is expected to indirectly create

723
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,240
36

724
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,320
870 new jobs between 2022 and 2025

725
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,080
driven by the growth of the digital

726
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,559
economy and the telecom sector

727
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,679
so in conclusion

728
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,919
togo is a small country with a

729
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,640
population of 8 million people

730
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,520
but if you look at nigeria for example

731
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,440
equiano is expected to indirectly create

732
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,799
1.6 million jobs

733
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,799
between 2022 and 2025.

734
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,240
in nigeria and in south africa

735
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,320
real gdp

736
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,919
will be boosted to 10.1 billion

737
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,240
respectively and 7

738
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,720
billion

739
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,760
higher than it would otherwise have been

740
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,080
these are truly truly transformative

741
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,559
impacts and something that's we're very

742
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,760
proud

743
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,440
but as i've mentioned throughout this

744
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,399
presentation realizing africa's digital

745
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,000
potential requires partnerships

746
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,799
it also requires

747
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,519
partnerships across the value chain and

748
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,080
significant investments

749
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,720
the companies that take note of africa's

750
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,600
demographic economic and commercial

751
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,279
potential today

752
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,279
will be best positioned to captures

753
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,720
tomorrow's opportunities

754
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,039
i will now

755
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,640
show you

756
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,840
some cool images of building the equiano

757
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,240
cable

758
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,120
it turns out a big part of the cloud

759
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,600
isn't in the sky it takes the form of

760
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,080
fiber optic cables like this that

761
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,720
criss-cross the globe and google has one

762
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
of the most advanced global networks of

763
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,519
fiber-optic cables our sub-c cables are

764
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,200
carefully laid on the ocean floor

765
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,679
[Music]

766
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,760
compared to satellites submarine cables

767
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,360
are able to provide much higher

768
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,480
bandwidth and low latency which means

769
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
less delay for users when they're using

770
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,200
video streaming cloud services and

771
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,320
financial transactions

772
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
connecting people in places is at the

773
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,159
heart of what we do at google we don't

774
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,159
just want to organize the world's

775
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,760
information but we need to make it

776
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,000
universally accessible which means we

777
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,200
need to connect everyone on the planet

778
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,279
teams all over the world collaborate to

779
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,440
stretch our network fabric through an

780
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,480
enormous feat of partnership physics and

781
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,480
engineering

782
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,159
google's network operates like a mesh

783
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,360
our organization focuses on creating

784
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,919
solutions that interconnect humanity and

785
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,159
that's really the purpose of our network

786
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,919
our highest priority is to create a

787
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,000
network that society can depend on

788
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,840
thank you

789
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,200
so building in a pandemic posed a ton of

790
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,559
challenges

791
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,840
mainly communication challenges

792
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,919
between partners

793
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,240
not being able to do face-to-face

794
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,440
meetings or in-person meetings across

795
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,159
different languages different cultures

796
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,840
is difficult

797
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,200
it's um we we were however able to

798
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,159
manage to keep the schedule of equiano

799
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,840
rather on time

800
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,279
and there's only 90 days delay on a

801
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,000
project that is three and a half years

802
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,960
so we we really deployed treasures of

803
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,000
ingeniousity to make it happen

804
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,719
especially shipping

805
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,560
shipping in in this logistics

806
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,719
environment

807
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,119
so we had to resort to

808
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,639
every platform every communication

809
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,480
platform

810
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
that you all built

811
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,599
i have accounts on about everything i'm

812
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,719
able to reach partners on every platform

813
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,560
they want they need

814
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,639
it was uh definitely required

815
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,879
i have to say though that during all of

816
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,359
our communications with african partners

817
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,560
oftentimes

818
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,639
the video part would not work because

819
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,280
the bandwidth is too constrained

820
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,599
and that increases the challenge of

821
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,920
communicating as human beings

822
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,599
i'm extremely proud of the googlers

823
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,400
teamwork and their relentless dedication

824
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,200
to building the partnerships needed

825
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,440
for this cable in the past three and a

826
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,839
half years under really dire

827
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,079
conditions i'm also extremely grateful

828
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,599
for the commitment and resolve

829
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,960
demonstrated by all equiano partners in

830
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,560
saint helena in togo in portugal in

831
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,800
nigeria in namibia and south africa

832
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,480
and also our cable builder asn

833
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,599
and now

834
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,680
for the non-technical

835
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,359
and probably unsolicited advice

836
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,880
takeaways

837
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,720
during the pandemic

838
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,200
i'll leave you with this

839
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,520
nanook is a great great community

840
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,599
and you get

841
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,520
what you put in

842
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,560
so

843
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,440
you get what you give so i would say pay

844
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,800
it forward

845
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,720
make sure that you contribute to this

846
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,119
wonderful community it is so nice to

847
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,320
meet in person after so many years

848
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,760
and

849
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,520
this is a community of caring colleagues

850
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,640
and also some are now my friends for

851
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,200
life and you know who you are

852
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
so i would say get involved it's the

853
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
best way to connect to

854
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,359
others and the best way

855
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,760
to ensure that the internet continues to

856
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,240
be the thriving place that it is

857
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,040
um

858
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
in the internet is not just router

859
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,960
switches and machine i think it's

860
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,839
firstly all of you it's the people that

861
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,480
make it it's the people that connect

862
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,880
those machines and it's the people that

863
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,119
take the time to come to conferences and

864
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,960
share their knowledge

865
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
to build this internet

866
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,880
so my challenge to you

867
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,599
is to nurture your connections

868
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,839
when i was chair of nanak i would call

869
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,640
it the challenge 15 and i think i would

870
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,720
encourage everyone to meet at least 15

871
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,560
new people

872
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,880
we are all

873
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,839
really really

874
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,800
insecure introverts

875
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,680
i would say most of us

876
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,119
so

877
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,839
you're in company of good friends

878
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,359
so go out reach out and connect to 15.

879
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,640
and now i'm going to add my covet tax

880
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,560
i'm going to ask you to reach out to

881
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,400
five more

882
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
you still have two days to make 20 more

883
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,160
connections

884
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,079
those you made yesterday they don't

885
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,040
count

886
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,480
so you go

887
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,440
and meet with 15 more

888
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,079
plus five that's my covent tax

889
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,880
and also make sure that whenever you

890
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,760
look at what you do and how you choose

891
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,839
where you choose to prioritize your work

892
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,280
and your energy

893
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,119
go for impact

894
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,640
go for meaning

895
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
go for something that when you wake up

896
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,720
in the morning you go this is what i'm

897
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,000

hello my name is andrei sharbovich i'm

910
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,320
from mcgill university in montreal

911
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,680
canada

912
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,440
so uh

913
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,040
i'd like to

914
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,920
ask you about uh

915
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,160
first of all um like to

916
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,640
thank you for your excellent

917
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,359
contribution for the world connectivity

918
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,119
and

919
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,359
like to ask if this project is

920
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,079
coordinated or supported by

921
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,800
global organizations or united nations

922
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,520
or umdp or something like that

923
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,280
or maybe you are in partnership with

924
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,320
them because the bridging digital divide

925
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,040
is one of their goals as well

926
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,000
to

927
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
maintain sustainable development thank

928
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
you very much well thank you for your

929
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,520
question first i'll pass your

930
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,240
congratulations to the googlers who work

931
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,760
really hard on this

932
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
um this is one thing nothing nothing

933
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
happens without teamwork so there's a

934
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,240
really big team working on that i'll

935
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,000
make sure that they get your recognition

936
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,599
thank you for that

937
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,599
in terms of funding this cable was

938
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,880
funded by private funds it was funded by

939
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,800
google there was no external support

940
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,160
but we are

941
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,640
looking at multiple ways of investment

942
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,440
so

943
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,520
private is one

944
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,160
consortium is another

945
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,119
having funders is yet another so we're

946
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,400
very open

947
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,040
to working in many different ways to

948
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,040
support these infrastructure projects

949
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,079
yes

950
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,079
oh you have it

951
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,200
okay

952
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,599
i'm a dare i'm from internet too

953
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,720
all right

954
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,040
i'm short um

955
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,359
i have two questions if that's okay

956
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,880
yes it is okay

957
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,119
let's go for the first one

958
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,200
comparatively why was there such a low

959
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,598
speed increase projected in namibia

960
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,040
roughly the same as south africa so

961
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,119
namibia would be

962
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,200
comparable to south africa in terms of

963
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,400
internet speeds so it will

964
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,880
actually you can find this report online

965
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,200
we have published an economic impact it

966
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,119
will nearly double

967
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,800
and i think it's 41 decrease in cost

968
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,920
okay

969
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,480
and um why are there so many subsea

970
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,960
cables that land in djibouti and not the

971
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,119
surrounding countries

972
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,160
ah excellent question

973
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,119
submarine cables are particular beasts

974
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,520
they like good landings

975
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,160
they don't like rocky spots they don't

976
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,839
like

977
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,920
shallow waters

978
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,760
so

979
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,079
and they don't like areas where there's

980
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,400
increased fishing activities because

981
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,599
anchors of fishing boats might snap the

982
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,800
cables

983
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
so

984
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,400
landings are selected carefully to avoid

985
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,720
basically human activities but as you

986
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,280
can tell it's very hard to avoid all

987
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,359
human activity so

988
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,839
we compose with constraints

989
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,000
but djibouti is one of those locations

990
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,800
where

991
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,720
it's amenable

992
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,160
you're welcome

993
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,480
um we have a question from the chat from

994
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,240
tony taub uh sorry from

995
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,319
tone oh there's two questions one from

996
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,000
tony tauber at

997
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,520
comcast

998
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,920
maybe it was touched on and i missed it

999
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,079
will a partner be doing the operations

1000
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,319
and maintenance of these subsea systems

1001
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,560
i don't know what's typical

1002
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,920
we have two questions

1003
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,400
thank you so yes um

1004
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,680
there will be a there's a few concerns a

1005
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,319
few companies that do repairs and

1006
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,119
maintenance of submarine cables uh

1007
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,920
they're typically associations and they

1008
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,960
will cover uh an ocean

1009
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,560
um so we're we're in discussions with

1010
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,680
some of these uh providers to find

1011
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,520
the provider that will

1012
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,920
service the cable for the next 15 years

1013
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,839
hey um gabe blanchard from start.ca

1014
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,599
seriously

1015
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,800

try and share

1021
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,000
my personal aspiration is to bring the

1022
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,720
internet infrastructure in africa to the

1023
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,280
same level or at par

1024
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,000
with north america and europe so i do

1025
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,599
have a 10 year plan ahead of me

1026
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,079
okay and we have a question from tony

1027
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,839
lee um

1028
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,560
we're all familiar with dwdm technology

1029
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,319
can you please say a bit more about the

1030
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,520
optical

1031
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
switching technology that acriano is

1032
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,720
using

1033
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,680
yes so it's a fiber pair switching

1034
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,720
i will

1035
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,400
link a note we've published a few uh

1036
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,240
white papers on it

1037
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,920
so we're able to

1038
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,160
switch the fiber pairs as opposed to go

1039
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,720
on a spectrum basis

1040
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,880
yeah um

1041
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,400
chuck midori kentick um hi silvie hi so

1042
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,640
uh years ago i used to attend a lot of

1043
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,240
submarine cable conferences and i

1044
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,000
remember there would always be a panel

1045
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,400
on building in africa in particular and

1046
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,800
i remember one a couple years ago where

1047
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,560
there was a lot of concern uh

1048
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,640
specifically i think from chris wood

1049
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,079
chris wood of uh of wyock

1050
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,480
had expressed concern about over

1051
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,560
building submarine cable capacity before

1052
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,359
access layer uh or last mile is ready to

1053
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,359
absorb it where you'd kind of take out

1054
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,520
the market for i mean obviously he's

1055
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,440
more concerned maybe than google is for

1056
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,319
um

1057
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,880
making payroll but uh you could the

1058
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,160
concern is you could over build

1059
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,839
submarine cable before the access layer

1060
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,680
is is has any of that changed is that

1061
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,040
still a concern

1062
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,560
it is not

1063
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,760
as you can see what's changed is the

1064
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,160
gaps the demographic gaps and the

1065
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,720
connectivity gaps that i've explained

1066
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,599
so just the the population dividend will

1067
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,560
be so large in the next 20 years

1068
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,839
that

1069
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,119
with equiano and to africa it won't be

1070
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,480
enough

1071
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,880
we will need to start planning a new

1072
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,839
cable

1073
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,319
probably by year 10.

1074
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,240
so

1075
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,160
just think of 1.3 billion users to 2.5

1076
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,480
billion users 25 of the world's labor

1077
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,800
force

1078
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,960
in a in the context of digital

1079
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,480
transformation

1080
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,680
i don't think we will have a glut of

1081
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,599
internet capacity the same way that

1082
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,599
we've had a glot in the atlantic since

1083
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,599
the mid-90s

1084
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,920
thank you you're welcome

1085
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,920
um question from brian gladney um

1086
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,160
could you please restate estimated

1087
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,240
bandwidth with equiano i believe i

1088
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,240
missed it it's 12 fiber pairs of roughly

1089
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,800
12 terabit per second so currently a 144

1090
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,720
terabit per second

1091
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,400
and as your slte equipment

1092
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,960
increases or increases capacity you'll

1093
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,040
be able to increase that capacity as

1094
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,240
well

1095
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,560
um question at the back i think

1096
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,280
hi this is sumit from data communication

1097
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,280
a question like i'm seeing like a lot of

1098
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,040
developments being done for the south

1099
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,160
africa uh any plan for diet connectivity

1100
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,240
from south africa to the asia pacific

1101
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,479
like india singapore and those countries

1102
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,880
i didn't hear um can you repeat come

1103
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,720
closer could you come closer and perhaps

1104
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,400
um so any question any cables

1105
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,960
which google is planning for connecting

1106
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,599
uh south africa with the asia pacific

1107
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,480
countries like singapore india and like

1108
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,040
direct connectivity that sounds like a

1109
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,040
wonderful opportunity to explore

1110
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,160
thank you thank you you're welcome

1111
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,760
um there's a couple of other comments

1112
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
that people have made in the q a which

1113
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,119
people might want to read but they're

1114
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,560
not really questions

1115
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,078
do we have any other questions

1116
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,560
i think we can call that bitter wrath

1117
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,480
thank you so much sylvie you're so

1118
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,640
welcome and thank you bonjour abieto

1119
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,160
we're now going to go off script and

1120
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,680
surprise sylvie because she doesn't know

1121
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,480
about this bit

1122
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,839
no we're not doing this

1123
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,119
oh okay

1124
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,880
hey i

1125
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,400
i didn't get given the whole script

1126
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
obviously um you might like to go and

1127
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,160
talk to those two wonderful gentlemen in

1128
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,839
the corner over there
