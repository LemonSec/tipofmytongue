2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,879
hello everyone my name is vince cerf i'm

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,559
vice president and chief internet

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,639
evangelist at google and with me today

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
is john brzezowski who is a long time

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,400
ipv6 maven to say nothing a

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,480
very very long connection with the

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,400
internet's evolution and implementation

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,080
so john thanks for joining me today

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
so our topic today uh is ipv6 on by

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
default but i want to take you back to

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,880
june 6 2012 when we made a big

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,120
announcement basically saying

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,559
ipv4 is over it's time for ipv6 the era

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
has begun that was 10 years ago

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
uh here it is 10 years later and as far

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,559
as i can tell we still haven't got more

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,520
than maybe an average of 30 or maybe 35

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,000
percent implementation writ large

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
in some places it's very uh

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,199
helping heavily implemented uh some

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,239
organizations have full ipv4 and ipv6

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,199
capability and some have very little

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
so we should talk a little bit about

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,200
that but i'd like you to refresh my

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,520
memory uh for a moment when we made this

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,040
big announcement on june 6 2012

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,960
there something followed called happy

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,720
eyeballs which was sort of a way of

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
testing whether your v6 connection was

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
working

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,080
when did we announce that then or was

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,159
that later and what did it do for people

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,400
then it was um you know if i can quote a

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,159
good friend of ours stuart gesher from

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,560
from apple who um i spoke to in advance

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,520
of you know our discussion here um

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,920
happy eyeballs at apple and google and

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
others had a heavy hand in the creation

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,040
of it and if you look back then to 11

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,159
years ago

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,000
uh world library six day which was

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
preceded by world level six launch a lot

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
of the learnings that came into those

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,040
two events

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
really fueled the innovation around you

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,520
know approaches and technologies like

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
happy eyeballs while while there was

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
awareness and implementations being born

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,159
leading up to world ib6 launch which was

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,079
you know the you know kind of the decade

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,880
long

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
you know a decade ago

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
event that we're celebrating many of

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,480
those implementations really took you

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,280
know

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,560
took root after world v6 launch itself

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
and frankly changed the game as far as

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,040
adoption was concerned it really made

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
this idea that if there was anything

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,319
wrong or impaired about a b6

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,160
exploitation that it wasn't going to you

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
know affect adoption anyway and it has

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
truly done just that it was it was a

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,400
huge game changer for the acceleration

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
of adoption

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
well certainly a number of companies

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
mine included at google offered quite a

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
range of services uh accessible through

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,879
ipv6 including various streaming video

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
kinds of applications so it was a really

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,440
good test of our implementation well

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,720
let's talk a little bit about what the

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,440
consequences are of turning ipv6 on by

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
default everywhere

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,519
the first observation i guess is that

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,080
does it still work or does it could it

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,519
work with pure ipv6 and no ipv4 at all

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,560
this is sort of ipv6 only what's your

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
general sense right now about our

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
ability to operate without benefit of

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
ipv4

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,000
setting aside those people who don't

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
have ipv6 at all and so it doesn't work

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,080
without v4 but if they if they've got

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
ipv6 do you think ipv6 only is feasible

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,599
at this point

88
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,519
from a from a consumer facing internet

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,400
perspective probably not i'm sad to say

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
right i think the fundamentals are there

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,239
um i think people could use v6 to get v4

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,920
we can if we have time we could dive

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,000
into that but where i've personally seen

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
the greatest amount of success both both

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
firsthand and kind of collaboration with

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,879
others is where v6 only is used for

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
internal purposes you know larging

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
managing large deployments of you know k

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,040
modems mobile phones you know etc uh

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
hugely uh hugely usable in that space

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,599
and there are many there are many use

102
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,000
cases to point to in the field today

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
that are boasting you know tens of

104
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,400
millions hundreds of millions of devices

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,680
so so turning ipv6 on by default uh

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
doesn't necessarily turn off ibp4

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
although we'll have to get to the point

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,200
where

109
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
we can either do that or it's being

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,959
supported i guess by some sort of

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
address translation

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
technique am i correct that we already

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,839
have ways of getting to ipv4 even if

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,600
we're starting from an ipv6 address

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
absolutely i mean if you if you look at

116
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
our friends at t-mobile um you know

117
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,400
absolutely a poster child for uh you

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
know for for exactly this topology this

119
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,120
deployment methodology uh many of their

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,199
of their devices um

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,320
v6 only if not all um all still very

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
much

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,280
allowing for you know you know equal

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
access to both b4 and b6 content

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
wherever it happens to be

126
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,639
posted

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
so the obvious thing about ipv6 of

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,960
course is enormously larger address

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
space although i confess you i was a

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
little nervous when i heard that they

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
were going to start allocating 64-bit

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
prefixes and 64 bits of address space

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
for everybody to use i'll call it

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
locally it seemed like that would

135
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,639
consume it at a rather rapid pace

136
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,320
uh having been

137
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,960
sort of stung by the rapid pace of ipv4

138
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,320
consumption

139
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
but let's set that aside for just a

140
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,680
second

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
some people say well ipv6 is more secure

142
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
than ipv4 and i'm not so sure about that

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,479
what's your reaction to that statement

144
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,720
i think from uh implantation perspective

145
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
you're probably right then right an

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
implantation is an implication some have

147
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,160
made the argument that the vintage of

148
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
the implantations have afforded either a

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
an opportunity for a fresh looking

150
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
cleaner code or

151
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,479
less less runtime right so we both know

152
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,560
that after many decades of running code

153
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,320
that's that's how we really you know

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
ensure that it's secure it's really

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
through running it through its paces

156
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
right the the one thing that i can tell

157
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,280
you for sure is that the vastness of an

158
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,880
address of the address space it does

159
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
present some challenges it's like trying

160
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,000
to find a piece of hay

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
a very specific piece of hay in a

162
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,160
haystack right um so so that does that

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
does present some interesting challenges

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
which i think over time you know people

165
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,560
will find creative ways to to overcome

166
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
um but but i think you know

167
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,840
i think you and i are generally on the

168
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,759
same page you know like there's still

169
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,039
there's still many

170
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,840
you know many decades for us to kind of

171
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,800
catch up on around you know the

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
longevity of running code and maturity

173
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,039
that it affords implementations

174
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,120
so let's uh let's talk a little bit more

175
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
about efficiency because my

176
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,479
understanding is that when the ipv6

177
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,639
was finally concluded as you will recall

178
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,960
there were many competing alternatives

179
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,199
and when it finally settled out

180
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
the v6 format had some uh

181
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
simplifications

182
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,600
uh it took some things away that weren't

183
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
needed or did not appear to be needed

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
for our experience with v4

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,560
it looks like it's a more easily parsed

186
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
uh format and that might lead to some

187
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,880
efficiency am i guessing correctly about

188
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
that

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
yeah i mean at this stage you know they

190
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,039
you know

191
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,280
if i look way you know back 20 years

192
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
when you know

193
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
er early early days of v6 you know when

194
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
routers were still moving packets and

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,039
software not hardware um you know there

196
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,840
were there were many there are

197
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,280
many aspects of e6 that were still very

198
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
rudimentary in nature right yeah as you

199
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,000
look over the years how how slack

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,520
temporary addressing privacy addressing

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
all these things have taken shape very

202
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,759
much you know hinging around the 64-bit

203
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,720
boundaries as far as you know uh local

204
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,599
area use is concerned um there's there's

205
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,720
been a lot of

206
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,199
predictable and frankly you know usable

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,880
implementations that have that appeal

208
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
from from that from from the basis that

209
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,000
you know ip6 was born from

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,960
so we know that ipv6 is not 100

211
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,720
implemented everywhere otherwise we

212
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
might not be having this conversation

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,039
uh and let's hope that 10 years from now

214
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
we will be having a conversation

215
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,319
celebrating the fact that we've got it

216
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,440
everywhere

217
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,319
um is there any pattern to where it is

218
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,400
and where it isn't in terms of the

219
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
parties that have implemented and turned

220
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
on ipv6

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
yeah i mean i mean when you and i had

222
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
had kind of um you know had the

223
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,280
opportunity to kind of see one another a

224
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,120
little while ago we talked about this

225
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,680
right and um you know in the in the in

226
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
the time period that trailed world

227
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,440
obviously launched

228
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,840
we saw a lot of adoption uh the largest

229
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
carriers on the planet whether they were

230
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,199
fixed line or wire line

231
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,000
um we saw you know you know giants in

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
the content space you know google you

233
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,120
know facebook netflix etc all

234
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,719
all adopt as well

235
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,479
yeah i think over the past 10 years been

236
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,559
and like wow it's been 10 years holy cow

237
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,000
and i really do hope i really do hope

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
that you and i are not doing this again

239
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
in another 10 years um

240
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,440
and i think what we found was that the

241
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
landscape across the internet has

242
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,360
changed um 10 years ago

243
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
you know cloud

244
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
i mean other than internally at google

245
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
and perhaps you could come on this there

246
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
wasn't really like a you know like a

247
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
like a commodity you know commercial

248
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,040
cloud that people were kind of using you

249
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,399
know heavily right

250
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,560
um so but now they are right and i think

251
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,040
you're finding that a lot of those folks

252
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,959
um well while some of them have kind of

253
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,320
began their journey from a b6 point of

254
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
view there's still a great deal of work

255
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
to be done as far as you know public

256
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,080
cloud is concerned um and cdns you know

257
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
i think folks like the names i've listed

258
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,760
previously on the content side they took

259
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,519
it upon themselves because they had they

260
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,120
had absolute you know control over their

261
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
own infrastructure but we still have cdm

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
players of a massive variety that are

263
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,440
still you know

264
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
not really turning it on by default

265
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
which i think is a pretty important part

266
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,640
of the theme that we've been talking

267
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,760
about here at v6 you know on by default

268
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
you know one last comment and then uh

269
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
hand it back but if you look back to

270
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,200
kind of the commitment that we all made

271
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,720
and there was really a small

272
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,040
a very tightly knit group of folks who

273
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,959
kind of engineered these events

274
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,320
we all agreed on by default um and and

275
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
leave it on right um even in some cases

276
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
you know consumers didn't even have the

277
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,800
ability to turn it off that's how

278
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
committed you know the initiative was

279
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
right so so i think i think we're there

280
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,240
again just a different set of players

281
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
so you know it's interesting to think a

282
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,399
little bit about the architecture of the

283
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
internet and as you suggest it certainly

284
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,360
seems to be changing one thing that's

285
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,839
happening is that the cloud providers

286
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,920
are building additional networking

287
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
infrastructure in order to meet the

288
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,399
internet service providers that our

289
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,480
customers are connected to

290
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
and so there's a uh i would say a trend

291
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
towards getting from the initial uh

292
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
internet service provider into some

293
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
cloud-based backbone network certainly

294
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
that's true for us at google

295
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,839
and i don't know to what extent that

296
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,640
does anything to ipv6 implementation but

297
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,160
it does say that

298
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
since a lot of the carriage is going to

299
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,399
be on these cloud-based backbone

300
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
networks we want them to be fully up and

301
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,680
running on ipv6 to be ready for anyone

302
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,959
who turns ipv6 on at all uh do you

303
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,600
suppose that that it would be hopeful

304
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
for us to figure out how to show where

305
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,079
v6 is running and where it is not

306
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,560
because i think jeff houston at ap nick

307
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
he's their chief scientist has been

308
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,800
trying for some time now to capture

309
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,839
information about ipv6 implementation

310
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,600
and maybe making that

311
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,839
more visible would be a helpful step as

312
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,800
we try to get to ipv6 on by default

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,120
everywhere

314
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
i couldn't agree more um yeah the the

315
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,399
folks at nano exit um i i you know i had

316
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,600
the pleasure to

317
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
to address the community back in the

318
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,000
fall and my first reaction to the to the

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,240
to the folks was wow like we're still

320
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
talking about trying to encourage you

321
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,279
know v6 you know adoption here i was

322
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,240
like you know

323
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,519
some of us have been there done that

324
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,240
right

325
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,399
and you know and so i went digging then

326
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,800
right i went digging and found like we

327
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
we still have

328
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
widely aggressively adopted open source

329
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,040
projects that start their life often

330
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,440
before and spent before only and spend

331
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,560
many years that way um so to un to

332
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
unpack a little bit of your comment

333
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
about jeff i think i think there's a lot

334
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
of value in that because what i think

335
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,040
what you'll find is that you know if you

336
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,399
follow the trail of breadcrumbs you'll

337
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,920
find that a lot of that starts with the

338
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
fact that people are just going to roll

339
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,639
their deployments out with what they

340
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,600
have

341
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,000
and if it were v6 on by default i'm

342
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,120
going to use kubernetes as a great

343
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
example i know kubernetes has made some

344
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
some you know fantastic

345
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
yeah um

346
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
you know enhancements as of late but for

347
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,160
many years now it's really been a v4

348
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,720
only story right and when it comes to

349
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,560
how people have chosen to deploy their

350
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,639
products and services a lot of that

351
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,480
ultimately was you know being hampered

352
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
by the fact that it was just from a v6

353
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,880
perspective is v4 only right so i think

354
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
i think um ivan i mean like you have an

355
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
enormous amount of respect for jeff he's

356
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,320
a great friend and he's you know a

357
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,639
brilliant speaker right and um and

358
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,240
there's a lot of amazing work that he

359
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,800
does that i think could help to very or

360
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
you know eloquently articulate you know

361
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
kind of the blind spots that we might

362
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
have in front of us today

363
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,079
so let's imagine that we succeed in

364
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,920
getting everybody to turn you know ip26

365
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,839
on by default i wonder what happens of

366
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,000
all the hotels in the world that are

367
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
essentially renting rooms because they

368
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
have good quality

369
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
internet service i wonder what happens

370
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,160
if ipv6 is on by default how many guests

371
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,760
would be calling saying help help i

372
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,279
can't get this to work

373
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,959
but that'll be an important test and

374
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,320
maybe that's something we should be

375
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
pushing for

376
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,800
uh let me uh let me move on to one other

377
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
question i have about uh current

378
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
implementations of ipv6 if they haven't

379
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,360
been heavily exercised of course we

380
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,880
don't know what the quality of the

381
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
implementation is and so one of the

382
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,959
things that might happen is that if we

383
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
go down this path and we succeed in

384
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,279
getting people to turn ipv6 on as a

385
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,240
normal

386
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,639
process i guess we should be prepared

387
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,600
for

388
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,560
a number of things to break uh and and

389
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,360
to encourage people not to turn it off

390
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,839
as a fix but to fix the problem so that

391
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,639
we can keep running with ipv6 but maybe

392
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,079
we'll have to

393
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,360
push that pretty hard

394
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,680
i think i think then if i may a comment

395
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
you know um i remember back in the mid

396
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,760
you know like 2005 time frame yeah and

397
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,040
before

398
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,519
it was uh it was it was pretty eye

399
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,680
opening for me right you know um you

400
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,079
know software switched software packet

401
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,760
movement you know for v6 you know you

402
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,480
know acetic hardware-based 4v4

403
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,600
um

404
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,279
a lot of work to be done on just basic

405
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,800
implementations you know even just

406
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,920
comparing things like point-to-point

407
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,279
interfaces between you know

408
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,480
heterogeneous you know vendor

409
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
environments was just not

410
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,000
it just just didn't work right um you

411
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,720
know fast forward 10 15 years a lot of

412
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
that a lot of that's been

413
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
you know water under the bridge for many

414
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,760
moons now

415
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
and um you know certainly scale tested

416
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,040
so i

417
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
part of me says just based on my own my

418
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
own first-hand experience you know

419
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,680
things of you know scale uh

420
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,720
nature

421
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
probably less of a concern for me yeah

422
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,720
things like you know edge cases might be

423
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,800
you know varying by by use case right so

424
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,079
like are there certain types of

425
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,160
deployments that have very specific

426
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,320
requirements um that that may not have

427
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,560
been you know

428
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
thoroughly vetted and i think vin that

429
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,920
the only thing that i can share with you

430
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,160
from my own personal experience is when

431
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,199
you when when you rely on v6 to run your

432
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,320
business

433
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,680
you you very quickly find out what what

434
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,360
doesn't work and you you come up with

435
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,399
very creative ways to get it there right

436
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,720
and i think and i think that's the key

437
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
i agree with that certainly everybody

438
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,600
running around with mobile phones

439
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,120
probably always has a v6 capability if

440
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,959
it's going to work at all i remember

441
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,079
having

442
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,880
i made my engineers wear pagers

443
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
after we turned our software over to the

444
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,199
operations teams so things didn't work

445
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,040
the engineers got awakened as well as

446
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,639
the ops guys and it's amazing how

447
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
quickly bugs got fixed

448
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
well one other thing just uh just to

449
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,360
kind of round up here um the first

450
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,759
observation that i would want to make is

451
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,000
that at google we discovered that we ran

452
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,560
out of ipv4 address space for our own

453
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
network the internal network

454
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
the amount that we were able to allocate

455
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,399
in private address space uh wasn't

456
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,160
sufficient and so we actually switched

457
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
over to ipv6

458
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,560
uh in our internal network in order to

459
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
allow continued growth that gives you a

460
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
sense for scale

461
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,639
i think that it would be really

462
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,519
wonderful uh if we could identify uh

463
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,519
let's turn ipv6 on permanently uh day

464
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,759
and uh and try to make that stick and

465
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,880
then ask you know to get a good

466
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,959
feedback mechanism so we can find out

467
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,279
you know and get reported any issues

468
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,759
arising so that everybody can learn from

469
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,480
the experience

470
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,040
i couldn't agree more and just to use

471
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
your your example about the google

472
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,600
network many others who've been

473
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,759
confronted by the same i mean i mean

474
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,199
let's be honest it's a business

475
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,279
challenge right you know you you know

476
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,800
there comes a point in time where you

477
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,720
know you have to kind of

478
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,800
decide like they might continue to

479
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,520
invest in v4 or am i going to invest in

480
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,919
v6 free myself from the constraints of

481
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
before so that i could operationalize

482
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:10,880
the same

483
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,039
google's done that with this network um

484
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,679
you know large fixed and wireless

485
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
providers have done the same for the

486
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,280
the the large volume of devices that

487
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,799
they have to provide ip to whether it's

488
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,359
a mobile phone or cable modem um and if

489
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,119
you just look at things like the public

490
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,440
cloud things like kubernetes very hungry

491
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,840
when it comes to

492
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,799
ipolization um

493
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,720
there are many analogs there that i

494
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,559
think we can continue to learn from as

495
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,280
we as we you know we push forward

496
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
so it sounds to me like you and i anyway

497
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,919
are in complete sync it's time to turn

498
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,960
this on

499
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
